            "englishTranslation": "Whenever the Prophet (SAW) approached Mount Safa, he would recite: 'Surely Safa and Marwah are among the signs of Allah. I begin by that which Allah began'. (1) Then he began (his Sa'y) at Mount Safa, climbing it until he could see the House (Kaaba). He then faced the Qiblah, repeating the words: 'Allah is the Most Great, Allah is the Most Great, Allah is the Most Great'. (2) Then he said: 'None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah alone. He fulfilled His Promise, He aided His slave, and He alone defeated the Confederates'. (3) Then he would ask Allah for what he liked, repeating the same thing like this three times. He did at Mount Marwah as he did at Mount Safa.",
