    "And by the night as it closes in",
    "And by the dawn when it breathes [i.e., stirs]",
    "[That] indeed, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is a word [conveyed by] a noble messenger [i.e., Gabriel]",

    "Then it will be said [to them], \"This is what you used to deny.\"",
    "No! Indeed, the record of the righteous is in ʿilliyyūn.",
    "And what can make you know what is ʿilliyyūn?",
    "It is [their destination recorded in] a register inscribed",
    "Which is witnessed by those brought near [to Allāh].",
    "Indeed, the righteous will be in pleasure",
    "On adorned couches, observing.",
    "You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.",
    "They will be given to drink [pure] wine [which was] sealed.",
    "The last of it is musk. So for this let the competitors compete.",

    "So Today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers,",
    "On adorned couches, observing.",
    "Have the disbelievers [not] been rewarded [this Day] for what they used to do?",

    "And when the earth has been extended",
    "And has cast out that within it and relinquished [it].",
    "And has listened [i.e., responded] to its Lord and was obligated [to do so] -",

    "So what is [the matter] with them [that] they do not believe,",
    "And when the Qur’ān is recited to them, they do not prostrate [to Allāh]?",
    "But those who have disbelieved deny,",

    "Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them is a reward uninterrupted.",
    "By the sky containing great stars",
    "And [by] the promised Day",
    "And [by] the witness and what is witnessed,",
    "Destroyed [i.e., cursed] were the companions of the trench",
    "[Containing] the fire full of fuel,",
    "When they were sitting near it.",
    "And they, to what they were doing against the believers, were witnesses. ",
    "And they resented them not except because they believed in Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy,",
    "To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And Allāh, over all things, is Witness.",
    "Indeed, those who have tortured the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire.",
    "Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great attainment.",
    "Indeed, the assault [i.e., vengeance] of your Lord is severe.",
    "Indeed, it is He who originates [creation] and repeats.",
    "And He is the Forgiving, the Affectionate,",
    "Honorable Owner of the Throne,",
    "Effecter of what He intends.",
    "Has there reached you the story of the soldiers -",
    "[Those of] Pharaoh and Thamūd?",
    "But they who disbelieve are in [persistent] denial,",
    "While Allāh encompasses them from behind.",
    "But this is an honored Qur’ān",
    "[Inscribed] in a Preserved Slate.",
    "By the sky and the night comer",
    "And what can make you know what is the night comer?",
    "It is the piercing star",
    "There is no soul but that it has over it a protector.",
    "So let man observe from what he was created.",
    "He was created from a fluid, ejected,",
    "Emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.",
    "Indeed, He [i.e., Allāh], to return him [to life], is Able.",
    "The Day when secrets will be put on trial,",
    "Then he [i.e., man] will have no power or any helper.",
    "By the sky which sends back",
    "And [by] the earth which splits,",
    "Indeed, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is a decisive statement,",
    "And it is not amusement.",
    "Indeed, they are planning a plan,",
    "But I am planning a plan.",
    "So allow time for the disbelievers. Leave them awhile.",
    "Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most High,",
    "Who created and proportioned",
    "And who destined and [then] guided",
    "And who brings out the pasture",
    "And [then] makes it black stubble.",
    "We will make you recite, [O Muḥammad], and you will not forget,",
    "Except what Allāh should will. Indeed, He knows what is declared and what is hidden.",
    "And We will ease you toward ease.",
    "So remind, if the reminder should benefit;",
    "He who fears [Allāh] will be reminded.",
    "But the wretched one will avoid it",
    "[He] who will [enter and] burn in the greatest Fire,",
    "Neither dying therein nor living.",
    "He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself",
    "And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.",
    "But you prefer the worldly life,",
    "While the Hereafter is better and more enduring.",
    "Indeed, this is in the former scriptures,",
    "The scriptures of Abraham and Moses.",
    "Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming [event]?",
    "[Some] faces, that Day, will be humbled,",
    "Working [hard] and exhausted.",
    "They will [enter to] burn in an intensely hot Fire.",
    "They will be given drink from a boiling spring.",
    "For them there will be no food except from a poisonous, thorny plant",
    "Which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger.",
    "[Other] faces, that Day, will show pleasure.",
    "With their effort [they are] satisfied",
    "In an elevated garden,",
    "Wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech.",
    "Within it is a flowing spring.",
    "Within it are couches raised high",
    "And cups put in place",
    "And cushions lined up",
    "And carpets spread around.",
    "Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created?",
    "And at the sky - how it is raised?",
    "And at the mountains - how they are erected?",
    "And at the earth - how it is spread out?",
    "So remind, [O Muḥammad]; you are only a reminder.",
    "You are not over them a controller.",
    "However, he who turns away and disbelieves",
    "Then Allāh will punish him with the greatest punishment.",
    "Indeed, to Us is their return.",
    "Then indeed, upon Us is their account.",
    "By the dawn",
    "And [by] ten nights",
    "And [by] the even [number] and the odd",
    "And [by] the night when it passes,",
    "Is there [not] in [all] that an oath [sufficient] for one of perception?",
    "Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ʿAad -",
    "[With] Iram - who had lofty pillars,",
    "The likes of whom had never been created in the land?",
    "And [with] Thamūd, who carved out the rocks in the valley?",
    "And [with] Pharaoh, owner of the stakes?",
    "[All of] whom oppressed within the lands",
    "And increased therein the corruption.",
    "So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.",
    "Indeed, your Lord is in observation.",
    "And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, \"My Lord has honored me.\"",
    "But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, \"My Lord has humiliated me.\"",
    "No! But you do not honor the orphan",
    "And you do not encourage one another to feed the poor.",
    "And you consume inheritance, devouring [it] altogether,",
    "And you love wealth with immense love.",
    "No! When the earth has been leveled - pounded and crushed",
    "And your Lord has come and the angels, rank upon rank,",
    "And brought [within view], that Day, is Hell - that Day, man will remember, but how [i.e., what good] to him will be the remembrance?",
    "He will say, \"Oh, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life.\"",
    "So on that Day, none will punish [as severely] as His punishment,",
    "And none will bind [as severely] as His binding [of the evildoers].",
    "[To the righteous it will be said], \"O reassured soul,",
    "Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him],",
    "And enter among My [righteous] servants",
    "And enter My Paradise.\"",
    "I swear by this city [i.e., Makkah]",
    "And you, [O Muḥammad], are free of restriction in this city",
    "And [by] the father and that which was born [of him],",
    "We have certainly created man into hardship.",
    "Does he think that never will anyone overcome him?",
    "He says, \"I have spent wealth in abundance.\"",
    "Does he think that no one has seen him?",
    "Have We not made for him two eyes?",
    "And a tongue and two lips?",
    "And have shown him the two ways?",
    "But he has not broken through the difficult pass.",
    "And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass?",
    "It is the freeing of a slave",
    "Or feeding on a day of severe hunger",
    "An orphan of near relationship",
    "Or a needy person in misery",
    "And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion.",
    "Those are the companions of the right.",
    "But they who disbelieved in Our signs - those are the companions of the left.",
    "Over them will be fire closed in.",

    "And the messenger of Allāh [i.e., Ṣāliḥ] said to them, \"[Do not harm] the she-camel of Allāh or [prevent her from] her drink.\"",

    "Indeed, your efforts are diverse.",
    "As for he who gives and fears Allāh",
    "And believes in the best [reward],",
    "We will ease him toward ease.",
    "But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need",
    "And denies the best [reward],",
    "We will ease him toward difficulty.",
    "And what will his wealth avail him when he falls?",
    "Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.",
    "And indeed, to us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life].",
    "So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing.",
    "None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one",
    "Who had denied and turned away.",
    "But the righteous one will avoid it",
    "[He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself",

    "And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.",
    "Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?",
    "And He found you lost and guided [you],",
    "And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient.",
    "So as for the orphan, do not oppress [him].",
    "And as for the petitioner, do not repel [him].",
    "But as for the favor of your Lord, report [it].",
    "Did We not expand for you, [O Muḥammad], your breast?",
    "And We removed from you your burden",
    "Which had weighed upon your back",
    "And raised high for you your repute.",
    "For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease [i.e., relief].",
    "Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.",

    "Recite in the name of your Lord who created",
    "Created man from a clinging substance.",
    "Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous -",
    "Who taught by the pen",
    "Taught man that which he knew not.",
    "No! [But] indeed, man transgresses",
    "Because he sees himself self-sufficient.",
    "Indeed, to your Lord is the return.",
