    "O you who wraps himself [in clothing]",
    "Arise [to pray] the night, except for a little -",
    "Half of it - or subtract from it a little",
    "Or add to it, and recite the Qur’ān with measured recitation.",
    "Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.",
    "Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue] and more suitable for words.",
    "Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.",
    "And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion.",
    "[He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs.",
    "And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.",
    "And leave Me with [the matter of] the deniers, those of ease [in life], and allow them respite a little.",
    "Indeed, with Us [for them] are shackles and burning fire.",
    "And food that chokes and a painful punishment -",
    "On the Day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down.",
    "Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.",
    "But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.",
    "Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a Day that will make the children white-haired?",
    "The heaven will break apart therefrom; ever is His promise fulfilled.",
    "Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way.",
    "Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muḥammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allāh determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur’ān. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of Allāh and others fighting for the cause of Allāh. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakāh and loan Allāh a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allāh. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful."
