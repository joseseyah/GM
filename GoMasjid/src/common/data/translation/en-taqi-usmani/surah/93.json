    "I swear by the forenoon,",

    "your Lord (O Prophet,) has neither forsaken you, nor has become displeased.",
    "Surely the Hereafter is much better for you than the present life.",
    "And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you will be pleased.",
    "Did He not find you an orphan, and give you shelter?",
    "And He found you unaware of the way (the Sharī‘ah ), then He guided you.",
    "and He found you in need, then made you need-free.",
    "Therefore, as for orphan, do not oppress him,",
    "and as for the beggar, do not scold him.",
    "And about the bounty of your Lord, do talk."
