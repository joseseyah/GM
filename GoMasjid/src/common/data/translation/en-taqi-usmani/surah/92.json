    "I swear by the night when it covers (the sun),",
    "and by the day when it unveils itself,",
    "and by the One who created the male and the female,",
    "your efforts are diverse:",
    "As for the one who gives (in charity) and fears Allah,",
    "and believes in the best (religion),",
    "We will facilitate for him the way to extreme ease (i.e. the comforts of Paradise).",
    "But the one who is miser and deems himself self-sufficient,",
    "and rejects the best (religion),",
    "We will facilitate for him the way to extreme distress.",
    "And his wealth will not help him when he will fall down (into Hell).",
    "Of course, it is undertaken by Us to guide,",
    "and in Our control is the Hereafter and the worldly life.",
    "So I have warned you of a blazing fire.",
    "None will enter it but the wretched one,",
    "who rejected (the truth) and turned away (from it).",
    "And saved from it will be the most God-fearing one,",
    "who gives his wealth (in charity) to become purified,",
    "while no one has conferred any favour on him for which he would give a return,",
    "but (he gave his wealth in charity) only to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High.",
    "And surely he will soon be happy."
