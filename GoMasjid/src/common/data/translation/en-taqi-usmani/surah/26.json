    "Tā sīn mīm.",
    "These are the verses of the manifest Book.",
    "(O Prophet,) perhaps you are going to let yourself collapse in grief because they do not believe.",
    "If We so will, We can send down to them a sign from the sky, for which their necks will stay bent in submission.",
    "Never a new message comes to them from the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah), but they become averse to it.",
    "Thus they rejected (the Truth); well, soon will come to them the real descriptions of what they used to ridicule.",
    "Have they not looked at the earth, how many of the noble pairs (of vegetation) We have caused to grow in it?",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "(Remember) when your Lord called Mūsā saying, “Go to the transgressing people,",
    "the people of Pharaoh. Do they not fear Allah?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “My Lord, I fear that they will reject me.",
    "My heart gets straitened, and my tongue is not fluent; so send for Hārūn.",
    "Moreover, they have (leveled) a charge of offence against me, and I fear they will kill me;”",
    "He (Allah) said, “Never! (They will not be able to kill you.) So go, both of you, with Our signs. We are with you, listening (to the conversation you will have with him.)",
    "So go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say, ‘We both are messengers of the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "(sent with the message) that you must send the children of Isrā’īl with us’”.",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “Did we not nourish you among us as a child? And you remained amidst us for years,",
    "and you did the blunder you did; still you are ungrateful.”",
    "He said, “I did that at a time when I was mistaken.",
    "Then I fled away from you when I feared you. Thereafter my Lord granted wisdom to me, and made me one of the messengers.",
    "As for the favor with which you are obliging me, it is that you have enslaved the children of Isrā’īl.”",
    "Pharaoh said, “What is the Lord of the worlds?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever there is between them, if you are to believe”",
    "He (The Pharaoh) said to those around him, “Are you not hearing?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your early forefathers”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “Your messenger who is sent to you is a mad man indeed.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Lord of the East and the West and whatever lies between them, if you are to understand.”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “If you adopt a God other than me, I will certainly put you to prison.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said “Will you (do this) even if I bring to you something evident?”",
    "He said, “Then bring it, if you are truthful.”",
    "So, he threw down his staff, and in no time it was a serpent, clearly visible,",
    "and he drew out his hand, and right then it was a white light to the onlookers.",
    "He (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him “This man is certainly an expert sorcerer”.",
    "He wants to expel you from your land with his sorcery. So what do you suggest?”",
    "They said, “Leave him and his brother alone for some time, and send heralds to the cities,",
    "so that they bring to you every highly expert sorcerer.”",
    "So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointed time of a known day,",
    "and it was said to the people, “Would you assemble,",
    "so that we may follow the sorcerers if they are victorious?”",
    "So, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, “Will there be a sure reward for us, if we are the victorious?”",
    "He said, “Yes, and of course, you will then be among the closer ones.”",
    "Mūsā said to them, “Throw you down what you are to throw.”",
    "So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the triumphant for sure.”",
    "Then Mūsā threw down his staff, and in no time it started swallowing the falsehood they invented.",
    "So the sorcerers were made (by the truth they saw) to fall down in prostration.",
    "They said, “We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,",
    "the Lord of Mūsā and Hārūn.”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I permit you. Surely, he (Mūsā) is the chief of you all, who has taught you sorcery. So you will soon know (your fate). I will cut off your hands and feet from different sides, and will crucify you all together.",
    "They said, “There is no harm. We will return to our Lord.",
    "We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our faults, as we are the first of the believers.”",
    "And We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Make My servants travel at night. You will be pursued.”",
    "So Pharaoh sent into the cities (his) men to muster (people)",
    "saying, “These are a small band,",
    "and indeed they are enraging us,",
    "and we are a host, well-armed.”",
    "Thus We expelled them (i.e. the people of Pharaoh) from gardens and springs,",
    "and from treasures and a noble abode.",
    "Thus it was. And We made the children of Isrā’īl inherit all such things.",
    "So they (the people of Pharaoh) pursued them (the people of Mūsā) at the time of sunrise.",
    "And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Mūsā said, “Surely we are overtaken.”",
    "He said, “Never! Indeed with me is my Lord. He will guide me.”",
    "So We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Strike the sea with your staff.” So it was severed apart, and each part became like a big mountain.",
    "Then We brought others close to that place.",
    "And We saved Mūsā and all those with him.",
    "Then we drowned the others.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "And recite before them the narrative of Ibrāhīm,",
    "when he said to his father and to his people, “What do you worship?”",
    "They said, “We worship idols, and stay devoted to them.”",
    "He said, “Do they listen to you when you call (them)",
    "or do they bring benefit to you or harm?”",
    "They said, “No, but we have found our fathers doing like this.”",
    "He said, “Have you then ever considered what you have been worshipping,",
    "you and your ancient fathers,",
    "they all are an enemy to me, except the Lord of the worlds,",
    "who created me, and who guides me,",
    "and Who feeds me and gives me drink,",
    "and when I become sick, He heals me,",
    "and who will make me die, then will give me life,",
    "and who, I hope, will forgive my fault on the Day of Retribution.",
    "O my Lord, give me wisdom, and make me join the righteous,",
    "and destine for me a truthful description among the next generations,",
    "and make me among those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,",
    "and forgive my father. Indeed he was one of those who went astray,",
    "and do not put me to disgrace on the Day when all will be raised to life,",
    "the Day when neither wealth will be of any use (to any one) nor sons,",
    "except to him who will come to Allah with a sound heart,",
    "and the Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing",
    "and the Hell will be fully uncovered for the perverse,",
    "and it will be said to them, ‘Where is that which you used to worship",
    "beside Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?’",
    "So they (their false gods) will be thrown on their faces into it - they and the erring people",
    "and the entire army of Iblīs (Satan), all together.",
    "They will say when they will be quarreling there with each other,",
    "‘By Allah, we were in open error",
    "when we used to equate you with the Lord of the worlds,",
    "and it is only the sinners who misguided us.",
    "Now we have neither any intercessors",
    "nor any true friend.",
    "Would that we have a chance to return whereby we may join the believers!’”",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of NūH rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother NūH said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So, fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds;",
    "so, fear Allah and obey me.”",
    "They said, “Shall we believe in you while you are followed by the lowest people?”",
    "He said, “I do not know about what they do;",
    "their account is with none but with my Lord, if you have sense.",
    "And I am not the one who would drive the believers away;",
    "I am no more than a plain warner.”",
    "They said, “Should you not stop, O NūH, you will surely be stoned.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, my people have rejected me.",
    "So judge between me and them with an open verdict, and save me and all the believers who are with me.”",
    "So We saved him and those with him in the Ark that was fully occupied.",
    "Then We drowned, after that, all the remaining.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful.",
    "The (people of) ‘Ād rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother Hūd said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you,",
    "so fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Do you erect on every height a monument, having no sound purpose,",
    "and take the objects of architecture as if you are going to live forever,",
    "and when you seize (someone) you seize as tyrants?",
    "So fear Allah and obey me.",
    "And fear the One who has supported you with what you know.",
    "He has supported you with cattle and sons,",
    "and with gardens and springs.",
    "In fact I fear for you the punishment of a horrible day.”",
    "They said, “It is all equal for us, whether you give us advice or you do not become one of the advisors.",
    "This is nothing but the practice of the ancient,",
    "and we are not going to be punished.”",
    "Thus they rejected him, so We destroyed them. Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The (people of) Thamūd rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother SāliH said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So, fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Will you be left secure in whatever is here,",
    "in gardens and springs,",
    "and in farms and date-palms, the spathes of which are interwoven?",
    "You hew out houses from the hills with pride.",
    "So fear Allah and obey me,",
    "and do not obey the order of the transgressors",
    "who make mischief on the land and who do not set things right”.",
    "They said, “You are merely one of those bewitched.",
    "You are nothing but a human like us. So, bring a sign if you are one of the truthful.”",
    "He said, “This is a she-camel. She has a share of water, and you have a share of water on a specified day.",
    "So do not touch her with evil (intent), lest you should be seized by a painful punishment.”",
    "But they killed her, then they became remorseful,",
    "and the punishment seized them. Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of LūT rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother LūT said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Do you go to the males (for having sex) out of the whole universe,",
    "and leave your wives whom your Lord has created for you? Indeed you are a people who cross (all) limits.”",
    "They said, “If you do not stop O LūT, you shall be included among the outcast.”",
    "He said “Indeed, I am annoyed with your act.",
    "My Lord, save me and my family from what they do.”",
    "So We saved him and his family, all of them",
    "except an old woman among those who remained behind.",
    "Then We destroyed the others,",
    "and subjected them to a terrible rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of Aaikah rejected the messengers",
    "when Shu‘aib said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So fear Allah and obey me.",
    "And I do not claim from you any reward for it; my reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Give full measure, and do not be among those who bring loss to others.",
    "Weigh with an even balance,",
    "and do not make people short of their things, and do not spread disorder in the land as mischief-makers,",
    "and be fearful of the One who created you and the former generations.”",
    "They said, “You are but one of the bewitched men.",
    "You are no more than a human like us, and in fact we consider you to be one of the liars.",
    "So cause a piece from the sky to fall down upon us, if you are one of the truthful.”",
    "He said, “My Lord knows well what you do.”",
    "Thus they rejected him, so they were seized by the torment of the Day of Canopy. Indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "This (Qur’ān) is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds.",
    "The Trusted Spirit has brought it down",
    "upon your heart, so that you become one of the warners",
    "in plain Arabic language.",
    "And of course, it is (mentioned) in the Scriptures of the former people.",
    "Is it not a proof for them that the knowledgeable of the children of Isrā’īl recognize him (the prophet)?",
    "Even if We had revealed it to a Non-Arab,",
    "and he had recited it to them, they would not have believed in it.",
    "This is how We have made it pass through the hearts of the sinners.",
    "They will not believe in it until they will see the painful punishment",
    "and it will come to them suddenly while they will not be anticipating (it),",
    "and (then) they will say, “Is it (possible) that we are given some respite?”",
    "Is it then Our punishment that they are trying to hasten up?",
    "So tell me, if We give them enjoyment for years,",
    "then comes to them what they are warned of,",
    "what help can they receive from the comforts they were given to enjoy?",
    "We did not destroy any town unless it has had warners",
    "to give advice, and We have never been unjust.",
    "And this (Qur’ān) is not brought down by devils.",
    "It neither suits them, nor are they able to (do this).",
    "In fact, they are kept far away from hearing (it at the time of revelation).",
    "So do not invoke any other god along with Allah, otherwise you will be among those who are to be punished.",
    "And warn the nearest people of your clan,",
    "and be kind with humbleness to the believers who followed you.",
    "So if they disobey you, then say, “I disown what you do,”",
    "and place your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful,",
    "Who sees you when you stand (in prayer,)",
    "and (sees) your movement among those who prostrate themselves.",
    "Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "Shall I tell you on whom the devils descend?",
    "They descend on every sinful liar.",
    "They give ear to hear (secretly,) and most of them tell lies.",
    "As for the poets, they are followed by the straying people.",
    "Did you not see that they wander in every valley,",
    "and that they say what they do not?",
    "Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah very much, and defend themselves after they are wronged. And the wrongdoers will soon know to which place they are going to return."
