    "When the sun will be folded up,",

    "and when the wild beasts will be gathered together,",
    "and when the seas will be flared up,",
    "and when the people will be arranged in categories,",
    "and when the girl-child that was buried alive will be asked,",
    "for what sin she was killed,",
    "and when the scrolls (of deeds) will be unrolled,",
    "and when the sky will be stripped off,",

    "So, I swear by those (stars) that recede,",
    "that proceed, that withdraw from the scene,",
    "and by the night when it departs,",
    "and the morning when it starts breathing,",
    "it (the Qur’ān) is surely the word of a noble messenger (Jibra’īl X),",
    "the one possessing power and a high status with the Lord of the Throne,",
    "the one obeyed there, trusted.",
    "Your companion (Muhammad ) is not a madman,",
    "and he did see him (Jibra’īl X) on the clear horizon.",
    "And he (the Prophet) is not stingy about (the news of) the unseen.",
    "Nor is it the word of an outcast satan (devil).",
    "Then where are you going?",
    "It is nothing else but a message of advice for all the worlds,",
    "for the benefit of any one from among you who intends to go straight.",
    "And you cannot intend (to do anything) unless it is so willed by Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."
