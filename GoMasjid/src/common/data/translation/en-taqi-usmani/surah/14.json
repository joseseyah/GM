    "Alif, Lām, Rā. This is a book We have sent down to you, so that you may deliver the people, with the will of their Lord, out of all sorts of darkness into the light, leading them to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy",
    "Allah, the One to whom belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Woe be to the disbelievers because of a severe punishment,",
    "to those who prefer the worldly life to the Hereafter and prevent (people) from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. Those have gone too far in straying.",
    "We did not send any messenger but (speaking) in the language of his people, so that he might clearly convey the message to them. So, Allah lets go astray whom He wills and lets find guidance whom He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "Surely, We sent Mūsā with Our signs saying to him, “Bring your people out of (all sorts of) darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah. Surely, there are signs therein for every one who observes patience and gratitude.",
    "And when Mūsā said to his people, “Remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who had been inflicting a grievous torment on you, slaughtering your sons and leaving your women alive. In that there was a great trial from your Lord.”",
    "(Recall the time) when your Lord declared, “If you express gratitude, I shall certainly give you more, and if you are ungrateful, then My punishment is severe.”",
    "And Mūsā said, “If you and all those on earth become ungrateful, then Allah is free of all needs, worthy of every praise.”",
    "Has there not come to you the news of those before you, the people of NūH, ‘Ād and Thamūd and of those after them. No one knows them except Allah. Their prophets came to them with clear signs, but they put their hands into their mouths and said, “We reject what you are sent with, and indeed we are in confounding doubt about what you are calling us to believe.”",
    "Their prophets said, “Is it in Allah that you have some doubt, who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you, so that He may forgive you some of your sins and give you respite up to a specified term.” They said, “You are no more than a human being like us. You want to prevent us from what our forefathers used to worship. So, bring us some clear authority.”",
    "Their prophets said to them, “We are no more than a human being like you, but Allah bestows His favour upon whom He wills from among His servants. It is not for us to bring you an authority without Allah’s permission, and in Allah the believers must place their trust.",
    "What is wrong with us that we should not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to our paths? We shall, of course, endure with patience all your persecutions; and all those who have to trust should trust only in Allah.”",
    "The disbelievers said to their prophets, “We shall certainly expel you from our land unless you come back to our faith.” So, their Lord revealed to them, “We shall destroy the transgressors,",
    "and shall certainly let you dwell in the land after them. This is for the one who is fearful of standing before Me and is fearful of My warning.”",
    "They sought final decision (by demanding the divine scourge), and (thus) every obstinate tyrant failed.",
    "The Hell is pursuing him, and he shall be made to drink pus-fluid,",
    "which he will arduously sip, and will not be able to swallow. Death will come upon him from every side, yet he will not die, and still a heavy chastisement will be ahead of him.",
    "The deeds of those who refuse to believe in their Lord are like ashes blown away by the wind on a stormy day. They will not be able to gain anything out of what they did. That is the farthest point of straying away from the right path.",
    "Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can put you away and bring a new creation;",
    "and that is not at all difficult for Allah.",
    "All of them shall appear before Allah. Then, the weak shall say to the arrogant, “We were your followers. So, can you relieve us a little from Allah’s punishment?” They will say, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we deplore or endure, we have no way out.”",
    "The Satan will say when the matter will have been decided, “Allah promised you a truthful promise while I gave you a promise and did not fulfill it. I had no authority over you, except that I invited you and you accepted my call. So, do not blame me, but blame yourselves. Neither I can come to your help, nor can you come to my help. I disown your associating me with Allah in the past. Surely, there is a painful punishment for the unjust.”",
    "And those who believed and did good deeds shall be admitted to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, living there forever by the will of Allah. There they shall greet each other with “Salām.”",
    "Have you not seen how Allah has set forth a parable: A good word is like a good tree, having its root firm and its branches in the sky.",
    "It brings its fruits at all times with the will of its Lord. Allah sets forth the parables for the people, so that they may take lesson.",
    "And the parable of a bad word is like a bad tree, removed from the top of the soil, having no firm root.",
    "Allah keeps the believers firm with the stable word in the worldly life and in the Hereafter; and Allah lets the unjust go astray; and Allah does what He wills.",
    "Have you not seen those who adopted disbelief in exchange of Allah’s favor and caused their people to disembark at a land of total destruction,",
    "(which is) the Jahannam. They shall enter it; and it is an evil place to dwell.",
    "They have set up partners with Allah, so that they may mislead (the people) from His path. Say, “Enjoy (for a while). Then your ultimate journey is to the Fire.”",
    "Say to My believing servants that they should establish Salāh and spend, secretly and openly, out of what We have given to them before there comes a day in which there is neither a trade nor friendship.",
    "Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky, then brought forth with it sustenance for you from the produce, and subjugated for you the ships, so that they may sail in the sea with His command, and subjugated for you the rivers;",
    "and He subjugated for you the sun and the moon, moving constantly, and subjugated for you the day and the night,",
    "and He gave you whatever you asked for. If you (try to) count the bounties of Allah, you cannot count them all. Indeed, man is highly unjust, very ungrateful.",
    "(Recall) when Ibrāhīm said, “My Lord, make this city peaceful, and keep me and my children away from worshiping idols.",
    "My Lord, they have misled many a people. So, the one who follows me does surely belong to me. As for the one who disobeys me, then You are Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "Our Lord, I have settled some of my children in a valley of no vegetation, close to Your sanctified House, so that, Our Lord, they may establish Salāh. So, make hearts of people yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits, so that they may be grateful.",
    "Our Lord, surely You know what we conceal and what we reveal.-Hidden from Allah is nothing whatsoever, neither in the earth nor in the heavens.",
    "Praise be to Allah who, despite my old age, blessed me with Ismā‘īl (Ishmael) and IsHāq (Isaac). Surely, my Lord is the One who listens to the prayer.",
    "My Lord, make me steadfast in Salāh, and my offspring as well. And, Our Lord, grant my prayer.",
    "Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and all believers on the day when reckoning shall take place.”",
    "Never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers are doing. He is but giving them respite up to a day when the eyes shall remain upraised (in terror).",
    "They shall be rushing with their heads raised upward; their eyes shall not return towards them and their hearts shall be hollow.",
    "Warn the people of a day when punishment will come upon them, and the wrongdoers will say, “Our Lord, give us respite for a short term, and we will respond to Your call and will follow the messengers.” (Allah will say), “Is it not that you had sworn oaths earlier that you would not have to leave (the world)?",
    "And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it became clear to you how We dealt with them, and We put forth for you the examples.”",
    "And they worked out their plot and whatever they plot is before Allah, even though their plot is such as would move the mountains.",
    "So, never think that Allah will do against His promise to His messengers. Surely, Allah is Mighty, the Lord of Retribution",
    "the day on which this earth will be turned into some other earth, and the skies as well, and they all shall appear before Allah, the One, the All-Dominant.",
    "On that day you will see the culprits tied up together in chains,",
    "their shirts will be of rosin, and their faces will be covered with Fire",
    "so that Allah repays everyone in full whatever he earned. Indeed, Allah is swift at reckoning.",
    "This is a message for mankind, so that they (take lesson and) be warned, and so that they may know that He is One God, and so that the people of understanding may observe the advice."
