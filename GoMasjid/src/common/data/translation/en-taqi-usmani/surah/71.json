    "We sent NūH to his people (and said to him): “Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them.”",
    "He said, “O my people, I openly warn you",
    "that you must worship Allah, and fear Him, and obey me,",
    "and Allah will forgive you your sins, and will respite you to an appointed term. Indeed when Allah’s term comes, it is not deferred, if you only know!”",
    "He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and day,",
    "but my call added only to their flight (from the truth).",
    "Whenever I called them, so that You might forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears, and wrapped their clothes around themselves, and grew obstinate, and waxed proud in extreme arrogance.",
    "Then I called them loudly,",
    "and then I spoke to them in public and spoke to them in private.",
    "So I said, ‘Pray to your Lord for your forgiveness,- Indeed He is Very-Forgiving, -",
    "and He will cause the heavens to rain upon you in abundance,",
    "and will help you with riches and sons, and will cause gardens to grow for you, and cause rivers to flow for you.",
    "What has happened to you that you do not appreciate the Majesty of Allah,",
    "while He has created you in different phases?",
    "Did you not see how Allah has created seven heavens one upon another,",
    "and has made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp?",
    "And Allah has caused you to grow well out of the earth,",
    "then He will send you back into it, and will bring you forth once again.",
    "And Allah has made the earth a spread for you,",
    "so that you may go about its broad ways.’”",
    "And said NūH, “My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed him whose wealth and children added nothing to him but loss,",
    "and they devised a mighty plot,",
    "and said (to their people), “Never forsake your gods, and never forsake Wadd, nor Suwā‘, nor Yaghūth and Ya‘ūq and Nasr.",
    "And they have led many astray. And (O my Lord,) let not the wrongdoers progress in anything but deviation from the right path.”",
    "Because of their sins they were drowned, and then admitted into the Fire. So they found no helpers for them besides Allah.",
    "And said NūH, “My Lord, do not leave on earth even a single inhabitant (surviving) out of the disbelievers.",
    "If You leave them (surviving), they will lead Your servants astray, and will beget none but a sinful disbeliever.",
    "My Lord, grant pardon to me, and to my parents, and to everyone who enters my home as a believer, and to all the believing men and believing women, and do not increase the wrongdoers but in ruin."
