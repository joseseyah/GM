    "He said, “Did I not tell you that you can never bear with me patiently?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “If I ask you about something after this, do not allow me your company. You have now reached a point where you have a valid excuse (to part with me) from my own side. “",
    "Then, they moved ahead until they came to the people of a town; they asked its people for food, and they refused to host them. Then, they found there a wall tending to fall down. So he (KhaDir) set it right. He (Mūsā) said, “If you wished, you could have charged a fee for this.”",
    "He said, “Here is the point of parting ways between me and you. I shall now explain to you the reality of things about which you could not remain patient.",
    "As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who worked at sea. So I wanted to make it defective, as there was a king across them who used to usurp every boat by force.",
    "As for the boy, his parents were believers. We apprehended that he would impose rebellion and infidelity upon them.",
    "We, therefore, wished that their Lord would replace him with someone better than him in piety, and more akin to affection.",
    "As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was a treasure beneath it belonging to them, and their father was a pious man. So your Lord willed that they should reach their maturity and dig out their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it on my own accord. This is the reality of things about which you could not remain patient.”",
    "They ask you about Dhul-Qarnain. Say, “I shall now recite to you an account of him.”",
    "Surely, We gave him power on earth and gave him means to (have) everything (he needs).",
    "So he followed a course,",
    "until when he reached the point of sunset, he found it setting into a miry spring, and found a people near it. We said, “O Dhul-Qarnain, either punish them or adopt good behavior with them.”",
    "He said, “As for him who does wrong, we shall punish him, then he will be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him with a severe punishment.",
    "As for the one who believes and acts righteously, he will have the best (life) as reward, and we shall speak to him politely in our directions.”",
    "Thereafter, he followed a course,",
    "until when he reached the point of sunrise, he found it rising over a people for whom We did not make any shelter against it.",
    "Thus it was, and Our knowledge fully comprehends whatever (wealth and equipment) he had with him.",
    "Thereafter he followed a course",
    "until when he reached between the two mountains, he found by them a people who were almost unable to understand anything said.",
    "They said, “O Dhul-Qarnain, the (tribes of) Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj (Gog and Magog) are mischief-makers on the earth. So, should we assign a tax for you on condition that you make a barrier between us and them?”",
    "He said, “What my Lord has (already) given in my control is better enough (for me than the tax you are offering to me), so help me (only) with some (man) power, and I shall make a rampart between you and them.",
    "Bring me big pieces of iron.” (They proceeded accordingly) until when he leveled up (the gap) between the two cliffs, he said, “Blow.” (They complied) until when he made it (like) fire, he said, “Bring me molten copper, and I will pour it upon this.”",
    "So they (Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj) were not able to climb it, nor were they able to make a hole in it.",
    "He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. Then, when the promise of my Lord will come, He will make it leveled to the ground. The promise of my Lord is true.”",
    "And on that day, (i.e. the Doomsday) We will leave them (all the people including Ya’jūj and Ma’jūj) surging over one another. And the Horn shall be blown, then We shall gather them together.",
    "And on that day We will bring Jahannam fully exposed before the infidels",
    "whose eyes were under a cover against My reminders, and they were not able to listen.",
    "Do, then, the disbelievers deem (it fit) that they take My servants as patrons beside Me? Surely, We have prepared Jahannam as entertainment for the disbelievers.",
    "Say, “Shall We tell you about the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?",
    "Those are the ones whose effort in the worldly life has gone in vain, while they think they are doing well.",
    "Those are the ones who rejected the signs of their Lord and (the concept of) meeting with Him, so their deeds have gone to waste, and We shall assign to them no weight at all.",
    "That is their punishment, the Jahannam , for they disbelieved and made My signs and My messengers a mockery.",
    "Surely those who believed and did righteous deeds, theirs are the Gardens of Firdaus as entertainment",
    "where they will live forever, and will not wish to move from there.”",
    "Say, “If the ocean were to be ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, the ocean would have been consumed before the Words of my Lord are exhausted, even though we were to bring another (ocean) like it in addition.”",
    "Say, “Surely, I am but a human being like you; it is revealed to me that your God is the One God. So the one who hopes to meet his Lord must do righteous deed and must not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord.”",
    "Kāf, Hā Yā, ‘Ain, Sād",
    "This is a narration of your Lord’s mercy to His servant Zakariyyā,",
    "When he called his Lord in a low voice.",
    "He said, “My Lord, I am in a state that bones in my body have turned feeble, and the head has flared up grey with old age, and I never remained, My Lord, unanswered in my prayer to You.",
    "I fear (my) kinsmen after me, and my wife is barren, so bless me with an heir, from Your own side,",
    "who inherits me and inherits the house of Ya‘qūb. And make him, My Lord, a favourite one.”",
    "(Allah said) “O Zakariyyā, We give you the good news of a boy whose name is YaHyā. We did not create any one before him of the same name.”",
    "He Said, “My Lord, how shall there be a boy for me while my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme of old age?”",
    "He said, “So it is; your Lord said ‘it is easy for Me, and I did create you before, when you were nothing.’”",
    "He said, “My Lord, make for me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not (be able to) speak to the people for three (consecutive) nights, even though you will be sound in health.”",
    "Then he came out to his people from the place of prayer, and directed them by gestures to proclaim the purity of Allah at morning and evening.",
    "(When the child was born, Allah said to him,) “O YaHyā, hold on to the Book firmly.” And We gave him wisdom, while he was still a child,",
    "and (blessed him with) love from our own, and purity; and he was God-fearing,",
    "and he was good to his parents; and he was not oppressive (or) disobedient.",
    "Peace on him the day he was born, the day he dies and the day he will be raised alive.",
    "And mention in the Book (the story of) Maryam, when she secluded herself from her people to a place towards East,",
    "then she used a barrier to hide herself from them. Then, We sent to her Our Spirit, (Jibra’īl) and he took before her the form of a perfect human being.",
    "She said, “I seek refuge with the All-Merciful (Allah) against you, if you are God-fearing.”",
    "He said, “I am but a message-bearer of your Lord (sent) to give you a boy, purified.”",
    "She said, “How shall I have a boy while no human has ever touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?”",
    "He said, “So it is; your Lord said, ‘It is easy for Me, and (We will do this) so that We make it a sign for people and a mercy from Us, and this is a matter already destined.’”",
    "So she conceived him, and went in seclusion with him to a remote place.",
    "Then the labour pains brought her to the trunk of a palm-tree. She said “O that I would have died before this, and would have been something gone, forgotten.”",
    "Then he called her from beneath her: “Do not grieve; your Lord has placed a stream beneath you.",
    "Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards yourself and, it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates.",
    "So eat, drink and cool your eyes. Then if you see any human being, say (to him), “I have vowed a fast (of silence) for the All-Merciful (Allah,) and therefore, I shall never speak to any human today.”",
    "Then she came to her people carrying him (the baby). They said, “O Maryam you have committed something grave indeed.",
    "O sister of Hārūn, neither your father was a man of evil nor was your mother unchaste.”",
    "So, she pointed towards him (the baby). They said, “How shall we speak to someone who is still a child in the cradle?”",
    "Spoke he (the baby), “Verily I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Book, and made me a prophet,",
    "and He has made me a blessed one wherever I be, and has enjoined Salāh and Zakāh upon me as long as I am alive,",
    "and (He has made me) good to my mother, and he did not make me oppressive (or) ill-fated.",
    "And peace is upon me the day I was born, the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised alive again.”",
    "That is ‘Īsā, the son of Maryam, to say the truth in which they (Christians) are disputing.",
    "It is not for Allah to have a son. Pure is He. When He decides a thing, He simply says to it, “Be” and it comes to be.",
    "And (O Prophet, say to the people,) “Allah is surely my Lord and your Lord. So, worship Him. This is the straight path.”",
    "Then the groups among them fell in dispute. So, how evil is the fate of the disbelievers when they have to face the Great Day.",
    "How strong will their hearing be, and how strong their vision, the day they will come to Us! But today the transgressors are straying in clear error.",
    "Warn them of The Day of Remorse when the whole thing will be settled, while they are heedless and do not believe.",
    "Surely We, only We, shall be the ultimate owner of the earth and all those on it, and to Us they will be returned.",
    "And mention in the Book (the story of) Ibrāhīm. Indeed, he was Siddīq (a man of truth), a prophet,",
    "when he said to his father, “My dear father, why do you worship something that does neither hear nor see, nor help you in any way?",
    "My dear father, indeed there has come to me a knowledge that has not come to you; so, follow me, and I shall lead you to a straight path.",
    "My dear father, do not worship the Satan. The Satan is surely rebellious to the All-Merciful, (Allah).",
    "My dear father, I fear lest a punishment from the All- Merciful (Allah) should afflict you, and you become a companion of Satan.”",
    "He said, “Are you averse to my gods O Ibrāhīm? Should you not stop, I will definitely stone you. And leave me for good.”",
    "He said, “Peace on you. I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord. He has always been gracious to me.",
    "And I go away from you and what you invoke besides Allah. And I shall invoke my Lord. Hopefully I shall not be a loser by invoking my Lord.”",
    "So, when he went away from them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We blessed him with IsHāq (Isaac) and Ya‘qūb (Jacob) and We made each one of them a prophet,",
    "and We bestowed on them (a great deal) of our mercy, and caused them to have a good name at a high level.",
    "And mention in the Book (the story of) Mūsā. Indeed he was a chosen one and was a messenger, a prophet.",
    "And We called him from the right side of the mount Tūr (Sinai), and We brought him close to communicate in secret.",
    "And, out of Our mercy, We granted him his brother Hārūn as a prophet.",
    "And mention in the Book (the story of) Ismā‘īl. He was indeed true to his promise, and was a messenger, a prophet.",
    "He used to enjoin Salāh and Zakāh upon his family, and was favourite to his Lord.",
    "And mention in the Book (the story of) Idrīs. He was indeed a Siddīq (man of truth), a prophet.",
    "We raised him to a high place.",
    "Those are the people whom Allah has blessed with bounties, the prophets from the progeny of ’Ādam, and of those whom We caused to board (the Ark) along with NūH, and from the progeny of Ibrāhīm and Isrā’īl (Jacob), and from those whom We guided and selected. When the verses of The RaHmān (The All-Merciful) were recited before them, they used to fall down in Sajdah (prostration), while they were weeping.",
    "Then came after them the successors who neglected Salāh and followed (their selfish) desires. So they will soon face (the outcome of their) deviation,",
    "except those who repent and believe and do good deeds, and therefore they will enter the Paradise and will not be wronged at all.",
    "(They will enter) the Gardens of eternity, promised by the All-Merciful (Allah) to His servants, in the unseen world. They will surely reach (the places of) His promise.",
    "They will not hear anything absurd therein, but a word of peace, and there they will have their provision at morn and eve.",
    "That is the Paradise We will give as inheritance to those of Our servants who have been God-fearing.",
    "(Jibra’īl X said to the Holy Prophet) “We do not descend but with the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is in front of us and what is behind us and what is in between; and your Lord is not the One who forgets.",
    "(He is) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them. So, worship Him and persevere in His worship. Do you know any one worthy of His name?”",
    "Man says, “Is it that, once I die, I shall be brought forth alive?”",
    "Does not the man remember that We created him before, when he was nothing?",
    "So, by your Lord, We will definitely gather them together, and the devils as well; then We will definitely make them present around the Jahannam , fallen on their knees.",
    "Then, out of every group, We will certainly draw out those who were more rebellious against the All-Merciful (Allah).",
    "Then of course, We are most aware of those who are more deserving to enter it (the Jahannam ).",
    "There is none among you who does not have to arrive at it. This is undertaken by your Lord as an absolute decree, bound to be enforced.",
    "Then We will save those who feared Allah, and will leave the wrongdoers in it, fallen on their knees.",
    "When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, the disbelievers say to the believers, “Which of the two groups is superior in its place and better in its assembly?”",
    "How many a generation We have destroyed before them who were better in assets and outlook!",
    "Say, “Whoever stays straying, let his term be extended by the All-Merciful (Allah) still longer, until when they will see what they are being warned of: either the punishment or the Hour (of Doom), then they will know who was worse in his place and weaker in his forces.",
    "Allah makes those on the right path excel in guidance. And the everlasting virtues are better with your Lord in respect of reward and better in their return.",
    "Have you, then, seen him who rejected Our verses and said, “I shall certainly be given wealth and children”?",
    "Has he peeped into the Unseen or taken a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah)?",
    "Never! We will write what he says and extend for him the punishment extensively.",
    "And We will inherit from him what he is talking about, and he will come to Us all alone.",
    "They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may be a source of might for them.",
    "Never! They (their fabricated deities) will soon reject their having worshipped them, and they will be just the opposite for them.",
    "Have you not seen that We have sent the devils onto the disbelievers inciting them with all their incitements.",
    "So make no hurry about them; We are but counting for them a count down.",
    "The day We will assemble the God-fearing before the All-Merciful (Allah) as guests,",
    "and will drive the sinners towards the Jahannam as herds of cattle (are driven) towards water,",
    "none will have power to intercede, except the one who has entered into a covenant with the All-Merciful (Allah).",
    "They say, “The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a son.”",
    "Indeed you have come up with such an abominable statement",
    "that the heavens are well-nigh to explode at it, and the earth to burst apart, and the mountains to fall down crumbling,",
    "for they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful (Allah),",
    "while it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son.",
    "There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to come to the All-Merciful as a salve.",
    "He has fully encompassed them and precisely calculated their numbers,",
    "and each one of them is bound to come to Him on the Day of Judgment, all alone.",
    "Surely, those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them the All-Merciful (Allah) will create love.",
    "So We have made it (the Qur’ān) easy through your tongue, so that you give with it the good news to the God-fearing, and warn with it an obstinate people.",
    "And how many a generation We have destroyed before them! Do you sense (the presence of) any one of them, or hear from them even a whisper?",
    "Tā-Hā",
    "We did not reveal the Qur’ān to you to (make you) face hardship",
    "rather to remind him who has the fear (of Allah),",
    "it being a revelation from the One Who created the earth, and high heavens.",
    "The RaHmān (Allah, the All-Merciful) has positioned Himself on the Throne.",
    "To Him belongs all that is in the heavens, all that is in the earth and whatever lies between them and whatever lies beneath the soil.",
    "If you pronounce the word aloud, then (it makes no difference, for) He certainly knows the secret and what is even more hidden.",
    "(Such is) Allah. There is no god but He. For Him are the Beautiful Names.",
    "Has there come to you the story of Mūsā?",
    "When he saw a fire and said to his family, “Stay here. I have noticed a fire. Perhaps I can bring you an ember from it, or find some guidance by the fire.”",
    "So when he came to it, he was called, “O Mūsā,",
    "it is Me, your Lord, so remove your shoes; you are in the sacred valley of Tuwā.",
    "I have chosen you (for prophet-hood), so listen to what is revealed:",
    "Surely, I AM ALLAH. There is no god but Myself, so worship Me, and establish Salāh for My remembrance.",
    "Surely, the Hour (i.e. the Day of Judgment) has to come. I would keep it secret, so that everyone is given a return for the effort one makes.",
    "So the one who does not believe in it and follows his desires must not make you neglectful of it, otherwise you will perish.",
    "And what is that in your right hand, O Mūsā?”",
    "He said, “It is my staff. I lean on it, and I beat down leaves with it for my sheep, and I have many other uses for it.”",
    "He said, “Throw it down O Mūsā”.",
    "So, he threw it down, and suddenly it was a snake, running around.",
    "He said, “Pick it up, and be not scared. We shall restore it to its former state.",
    "And press your hand under your arm, and it will come out (brightly) white without any disease, as another sign,",
    "so that We may show you some of Our great signs.",
    "Go to Pharaoh. He has really exceeded all bounds.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace for me,",
    "and make my task easy for me",
    "and remove the knot from my tongue,",
    "so that they may understand my speech.",
    "And make for me an assistant from my own family,",
    "that is, Hārūn, my brother.",
    "Enhance with him my strength,",
    "and make him share my task,",
    "so that we proclaim Your purity in abundance",
    "and remember You in abundance.",
    "You are certainly watchful over us.”",
    "He said, “You have been granted your request O Mūsā.",
    "And We had bestowed Our favour on you another time,",
    "when We revealed to your mother what was to be revealed,",
    "that is, ‘Put him (the baby) in the chest, then cast it into the river, then let the river throw it by the shore, and it will be picked up by one who is enemy to Me and enemy to him.’ And I had cast love on you from Myself (so that you might be favourite of all), and that you might be brought up under My eye.",
    "(Remember) when your sister was going (to the family of Pharaoh) and was saying, ‘Shall I lead you to one who nurses him?’ Thus We brought you back to your mother, so that her eyes might have comfort and she might not grieve. And you had killed a person, then We brought you out of the trouble; and We tested you with a great ordeal. Then you lived a number of years amidst the people of Madyan. After all this, you came O Mūsā, to a destined point of time.",
    "I have fashioned you for Myself.",
    "Go, you and your brother, with My signs, and do not be slack in My remembrance.",
    "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh; he has indeed transgressed all limits.",
    "So speak to him in soft words. May be, he accepts the advice or fears (Allah)”.",
    "They said, “Our Lord, we fear that he will hasten against us, or will become (more) rebellious (against You).”",
    "He said, “Do not be afraid. I AM surely with you both. I hear and I see.",
    "So, come to him and say, ‘We are the messengers of your Lord. So, let the children of Isrā’īl go with us, and do not persecute them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; and peace be upon the one who follows the guidance.",
    "Verily, it has been revealed to us that the punishment is for the one who denies and turns away.’”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O Mūsā?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Our Lord is the One who gave everything its due shape, then guided it.”",
    "He said, “Then, what is the status of the earlier generations?”",
    "He replied, “The knowledge about those is with my Lord in a Book. My Lord does neither err nor forget.”",
    "(He is) the One who made the earth a cradle for you, and made in it pathways for you to move, and sent down water from the heavens; and We brought forth with it pairs of different vegetations :",
    "Eat, and graze your cattle. Surely, in that there are signs for the people of understanding.",
    "From this (dust) We created you, and in this we shall put you back, and from this We shall raise you up once again.",
    "And We showed him (Pharaoh) all Our signs, yet he rejected and refused.",
    "Said he, “Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your sorcery, O Mūsā?",
    "We will, then, bring to you a similar sorcery. So, make an appointment between you and us for an even place, not to be backed out, neither by us nor by you.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Your appointment is the festival day, and the people should be assembled at forenoon.”",
    "So, Pharaoh turned back, and put his plot together, then came.",
    "Mūsā said to them, “Pity on you, do not fabricate a lie against Allah, lest He should destroy you with a punishment. And loser is he who fabricates a lie.”",
    "Then, they disputed among themselves in their matter, and kept their talk secret.",
    "Said they, “Certainly, these two are sorcerers who wish to drive you out from your land, and do away with your excellent way of life.",
    "So, make your plot firm and come forth in one row. Successful today is the one who prevails.”",
    "They said, “O Mūsā, either you throw (first), or shall we be first to throw?”",
    "He said, “Rather, you throw.” Then, suddenly their ropes and sticks seemed to him, due to their magic, as if they were running.",
    "So, Mūsā concealed some fear in his heart.",
    "We said, “Do not be scared. Certainly, you are to be the upper most.",
    "And throw what is in your right hand, and it will devour what they have concocted. What they have concocted is but a sleight of a magician. And the magician does not succeed wherever he comes from.”",
    "So, the magicians were led (by the truth) to fall in prostration. They said, “We have (now) believed in the Lord of Hārūn and Mūsā.”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I permit you. This man is in fact your master who has taught you the magic. So I will certainly cut off your hands and your legs from opposite sides, and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall know whose punishment, out of us, is more severe and more lasting.”",
    "They said, “We will never prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us, and over Him who has created us. So, decide whatever you have to decide. You will decide only for this worldly life.",
    "We have put our faith in our Lord, so that He forgives us for our sins and for the magic you compelled us to perform. And Allah is the Best and Everlasting.”",
    "Surely whoever comes to his Lord as a sinner, for him there is Jahannam in which he neither will die nor will live (a happy life).",
    "And whoever will come to Him as believer, having done righteous deeds, for such people there are the highest ranks,",
    "the eternal gardens beneath which rivers flow, in which they shall live for ever. That is the reward for the one who has purified himself.",
    "And We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Set out with my servants at night, then make for them a dry path across the sea (with the strike of your staff), neither fearing to be caught up, nor having any fear (of drowning).”",
    "Then Pharaoh chased them with his troops. So, they were encircled by that (huge wave) from the sea which overwhelmed them.",
    "Pharaoh held his people astray, and did not show them the right path.",
    "O children of Isrā’īl , We delivered you from your enemy and appointed for you the right side of the mount Tūr (Sinai), and sent down for you the Mann and Salwā :",
    "Eat from the good things We have provided to you, and do not exceed the limits in it, lest My wrath should descend on you. The one upon whom My wrath descends certainly falls into destruction.",
    "Surely I am the Most-Forgiving for him who repents and believes and acts righteously, then follows the right path.",
    "“What has caused you to hurry before your people, O Mūsā?”",
    "He said, “Here they are just behind me, and I hurried towards You, my Lord, so that You be pleased.”",
    "He said, “We have then put your people to test after you (left them) and Sāmiriyy has misguided them.”",
    "So, Mūsā went back to his people, angry and sad. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Did then the time become too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord befalls you, and hence you broke your promise to me?”",
    "They said, “We did not break our promise to you of our own accord, but we were burdened with loads from the ornaments of the people;so we threw them, and thus did Sāmiriyy cast.”",
    "Then he brought forth for them a calf, which was (merely) a body with a lowing sound. Then they said, “This is your god and the god of Mūsā, and he (Mūsā) erred.”",
    "Have they not been seeing that it did not respond to them (even) with a word, nor did it have power to harm or benefit them?",
    "Hārūn had already said to them, “O my people, you have only been led astray with it, and your Lord is the RaHmān (All-Merciful). So follow me and obey my command.”",
    "They said, “We will never cease to stay with it in devotion, until Mūsā returns to us.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “O Hārūn, what did prevent you from following me when you saw them going astray?",
    "Did you then disobey my command?”",
    "He said, “O son of my mother, do not hold me by my beard, nor by my head. I feared that you would say, ‘You have caused discord among the children of Isrā’īl and did not observe my advice.’”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “What then is your case, O Sāmiriyy?”",
    "He said, “I perceived something they did not perceive. So I picked up a handful from under the footstep of the messenger. Then, I cast it. And thus my inner self tempted me.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Then go away; it is destined for you that, throughout your life, you will say: ‘Do not touch me’. And, of course, you have another promise that will not be broken for you. And look at your god to which you stayed devoted. We will certainly burn it, then we will scatter it thoroughly in the sea.",
    "Your God is Allah other than whom there is no god. He encompasses everything with knowledge.”",
    "This is how We narrate to you certain events of what has passed, and We have given to you, from Ourself, a (book of) advice.",
    "Whoever turns away from it shall certainly bear a heavy burden on Doomsday,",
    "all such people living under it forever. And how evil for them will be that burden on the Doomsday!",
    "The Day when the Horn (Sūr) will be blown, and We shall gather them together while they will have turned blue on that day,",
    "and will be whispering among themselves, “You did not remain (in graves) more than ten (days)”.",
    "We know very well what they say, when the best of them in his ways will say, “You did not remain more than one day.”",
    "They ask you about the mountains. So, say (to them), “My Lord will crush them into dust thoroughly,",
    "then will turn them into a leveled plain",
    "in which you will see neither a curve nor an uneven place.”",
    "That day they will follow the caller who will find no deviation (from anyone). And the voices will turn low in awe for the RaHmān (All-Merciful, Allah). So, you will hear not but whispering.",
    "That day no intercession will be of any use to anyone, except the one whom the RaHmān (All-Merciful, Allah) has permitted and was pleased with his word.",
    "He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them, and they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge.",
    "All faces will be humbled before (Allah,) the Ever-Alive, the All-Sustaining; and the loser will be the one who bears (the burden of his) injustice.",
    "But whoever does righteous deeds, while he is a believer, shall fear neither injustice nor curtailment (of his rewards).",
    "And in this way We have sent it down to you as an Arabic Qur’ān, and have detailed in it some warnings in various ways, so that they may fear, or it may produce a lesson for them.",
    "So High above all is Allah, the True King! And do not hasten with (reciting) the Qur’ān before its revelation to you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, improve me in knowledge.”",
    "We had given a directive to ’Ādam earlier, then he forgot, and We did not find in him a firm resolve.",
    "When We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to ’Ādam”. So, all of them fell prostrate, except Iblīs , who refused.",
    "So, We said “’Ādam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not expel you from Paradise, lest you should get into trouble.",
    "Here you have the privilege that you will not be hungry nor will you be unclad,",
    "and you will not be thirsty, nor will you be exposed to sun.”",
    "Then the Satan instigated him. He said, “’Ādam, shall I guide you to the tree of eternity and to an empire that does not decay?”",
    "So, both of them Ādam and Hawwā’ (Eve)] ate from it, and their parts of shame were exposed to them, and they started stitching on themselves some of the leaves of Paradise. And ’Ādam disobeyed his Lord, and erred.",
    "Thereafter his Lord chose him. So He accepted his repentance and gave (him) guidance.",
    "He said (to ’Ādam and Iblīs), “Go down from here, all of you, some of you enemies of some others. Then, should some guidance come to you from Me, the one who follows My guidance shall not go astray, nor shall he be in trouble.",
    "As for the one who turns away from My message, he shall have a straitened life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Judgment.”",
    "He will say, “My Lord, why did you raise me blind while I was sighted?”",
    "He will say, “In the similar manner as Our signs came to you, and you had ignored them. In the same way you will be ignored today.”",
    "Thus We recompense him who exceeds the limits and does not believe in the signs of his Lord. Certainly the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.",
    "Did it give them no guidance (to realize) how many generations We have destroyed prior to them in whose dwellings they (often) walk around? Surely, in this there are signs for the men of reason.",
    "But for a word from your Lord that had passed earlier, and an appointed time that had been fixed, it (the punishment) would have been inevitable (for them).",
    "So, (O messenger,) endure with patience what they say, and proclaim the purity and praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset. And in some hours of night, proclaim His purity, and at points of the day as well, so that you may be pleased.",
    "Never stretch your eyes towards the things We have given to some groups of them to enjoy, so that We put them to test thereby, it being merely glamour of the worldly life. And the bounty of your Lord is much better and more lasting.",
    "Bid your family to perform Salāh, and adhere to it yourself. We ask no provision from you. We give provision to you. And the ultimate end is in favour of Taqwā (God-fearing, and piety).",
    "They say, “Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord?” Has there not come to them the clear sign of what is contained in the earlier Scriptures?",
    "And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have said, “Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and put to disgrace?”",
    "Say, “Everyone is waiting. So wait, then you will know who the people of the straight path are and who has followed the right guidance.”"
