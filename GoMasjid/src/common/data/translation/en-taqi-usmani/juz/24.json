    "So, who is more unjust than him who forges a lie against Allah and rejects the truth when it reached him? Is it not that in Jahannam (Hell) there is an abode for the disbelievers?",
    "As for the one who has come with the truth and believed it to be true, then such people are the ones who are God-fearing.",
    "For them, with their Lord, there is what they wish. That is the reward of those who are good in their deeds,",
    "so that Allah wipes out from them the worst deeds they did, and gives their reward to them for the best of what they used to do.",
    "Is Allah not sufficient for (the protection of) His slave? They are frightening you of those (false gods whom they worship) other than Him. Whomsoever Allah would let go astray, for him there is no one to guide.",
    "And whomsoever Allah gives guidance, for him there is no one to misguide. Is it not that Allah is Mighty, Powerful to avenge?",
    "If you ask them as to who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “Allah.” Say, “Then, tell me about those whom you invoke other than Allah, if Allah intends to cause some harm to me, are they (able) to remove the harm caused by Him? Or if He intends to bless me with mercy, are they (able) to hold back His mercy (from me)?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him trust those who (rightly) trust (in someone).”",
    "Say, “O my people, do at your place (what you are doing). I am to do (what I have been ordered to). Very soon, you will come to know",
    "as to who will be visited by a punishment that will disgrace him, and upon whom a lasting punishment will rest.",
    "We have sent down to you the Book for the people with truth. So, whoever follows the guidance, it is for his own good, and whoever goes astray, he will go astray only to his own detriment - and you are not responsible for them.",
    "Allah fully takes away the souls (of the people) at the time of their death, and (of) those who do not die, in their sleep. Then He withholds those on whom He had decreed death, and sends others back, up to an appointed term. Surely, in this, there are signs for a people who ponder.",
    "Is it that they have adopted intercessors out of those (whom they invoke) other than Allah? Say, “(Do you take them as intercessors) even though they have no power at all, nor do they understand?”",
    "Say, “Intercession belongs entirely to Allah.” To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.”",
    "When Allah is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter are filled with disgust, and when those (whom they worship) other than Him are mentioned, they become happy forthwith.",
    "Say, “O Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Knower of the unseen and the seen, you will judge between Your servants in that about which they used to differ.",
    "Were the wrongdoers to own all that is on earth, and even twice as much, they would surely seek to ransom themselves with it against the evil punishment on the Day of Judgment. There will appear to them from Allah what they have never imagined.",
    "Unveiled to them will be the evils of what they used to earn; and encircled they will be by what they used to ridicule.",
    "When man is visited by a trouble, he prays to Us, but when, after that, We favor him with some blessing from Us, he says, “This is given to me because of (my) knowledge.” No, but this is a trial, yet most of them do not know.",
    "The same was said by those before them, but what they used to earn was of no avail to them,",
    "and they were overtaken by the evils of what they had earned; and the wrongdoers from these (infidels too) will be overtaken by the evils of what they have earned - and they will not be able to escape.",
    "Do they not know that it is Allah who extends provision to whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills). Surely in that, there are signs for a people who believe.",
    "Say (on My behalf), “O servants of Mine who have acted recklessly against their own selves, do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Surely, Allah will forgive all sins. Surely, He is the One who is the Most-Forgiving, the Very-Merciful.",
    "Turn passionately towards your Lord, and submit to Him before the punishment comes to you, after which you will not be helped.",
    "And follow the best of what has been sent down to you from your Lord before the punishment comes to you suddenly when you do not even expect,",
    "lest someone should say, “Pity on me, because I fell short in respect of (observing the rights of) Allah and in fact, I was one of those who mocked”,",
    "or, (lest) someone should say, “If Allah were to show me the way, I would have surely been among those who fear Allah”,",
    "or, (lest) someone should say when he sees the punishment, “Would that I have a chance to return, so that I may become one of those who are good in their deeds.”",
    "No! My verses had reached you, but you called them untrue, and waxed proud, and became of those who disbelieved.",
    "And on the Day of Judgment, you will see those who had forged lies against Allah (in a state) that their faces are turned black. Is it not that in Jahannam there is an abode for the arrogant?",
    "And Allah will save the God-fearing (from Jahannam ), with utmost success granted to them, so as no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.",
    "Allah is Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian over everything.",
    "To Him belong the keys to the heavens and the earth. As for those who have rejected the verses of Allah, it is they who are the losers.",
    "Say, “Is it, then, someone other than Allah that you ask me to worship, O ignorant people?”",
    "It has already been revealed to you and to those before you (that): If you associate (partners with Allah), your deeds shall be rendered useless, and you shall be among the losers.",
    "On the contrary, it is Allah whom you should worship; and be among the grateful.",
    "They did not hold Allah in His true esteem. The whole earth will be in a single grip of His hand on the Day of Doom, and the heavens (will be) rolled up on his right hand. Pure is He, far too higher than what they associate with Him.",
    "And Horn (Sūr ) will be blown, and all those in the heavens and all those in the earth will faint, except the one whom Allah wills (otherwise). Thereafter, it will be blown once again, and suddenly they will stand up, looking around.",
    "And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the book (of everyone’s deeds) will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and matters will be decided between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.",
    "And everyone will be paid in full for what he did - and He knows best what they do.",
    "Those who disbelieved will be driven towards Jahannam in groups, until when they reach it, its gates will be opened, and its keepers will say to them, “Did messengers from among you not come to you reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you about the meeting of this day of yours?” They will say, “Yes (they did),but the word of punishment had become certain against those who disbelieved.”",
    "It will be said, “Enter the gates of Jahannam to live in it forever.” So, how evil is the dwelling-place of the arrogant!",
    "And those who used to fear their Lord will be led towards Jannah (Paradise) in groups, until when they reach it, while its gates will be (already) opened (for them), and its keepers will say to them, “Salāmun-’alaikum (peace be on you). How good are you! So, enter it to live here forever.”",
    "And they will say, “AlHamdulillāh : Praise belongs to Allah who made His promise come true for us, and made us inherit the territory, so as we can dwell anywhere we wish in Jannah (Paradise) . So, excellent is the reward of those who did (good) deeds.",
    "And you will see the angels ringed around the Throne proclaiming the purity of their Lord, along with His praise, and matters will stand settled between them rightfully, and it will be said: “AlHamdulillāhi-rabbil‘ālamīn : Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”",
    "Hā Mīm .",
    "This is revelation of the Book from Allah, the Mighty, the All-Knowing,",
    "the One who forgives sins and accepts repentance, the One who is severe in punishment, the One who is the source of all power. There is no god but He. To Him is the ultimate return (of all).",
    "No one quarrels about the verses of Allah, except those who disbelieve. So, their (prosperous) movements in the cities should not deceive you.",
    "Before these, the people of NūH and the groups after them had rejected (the messengers). Every group intended to seize their messenger, and raised disputes on the basis of falsehood, so that they might refute the truth with it, hence I seized them. So, how was My punishment?",
    "And similarly, the word of your Lord has become due against those who disbelieve-that they are the people of the Fire.",
    "Those who are bearing the Throne and those who are around it pronounce the purity of your Lord along with His praise, and believe in Him, and pray for the forgiveness of those who believe, (saying): “Our Lord, Your mercy and knowledge comprehends everything; so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the punishment of the Fire.",
    "And, our Lord, admit them to the eternal gardens of Jannah (Paradise) that You have promised for them, and (admit) those as well who did good from among their fathers and wives and children. You, only You, are the Mighty, the Wise,",
    "and save them from evils (of punishment). And whomsoever you save from evils that day, it is surely because you bless him with mercy. And that is the great achievement indeed.”",
    "Those who disbelieve will be addressed (by a voice saying): “Allah’s hatred (for you), when you were invited to the true faith and you refused, was greater than your hatred for yourselves (today when you are hating your own selves out of remorse).",
    "They will say, “Our Lord, You gave us death twice and You gave us life twice. Now we confess our sins. So, is there any way to come out of here?”",
    "(The reply will be, “No.) This is because whenever Allah alone was invoked, you used to disbelieve, and if partners were associated with Him, you used to believe. Now the decision lies with Allah, the High, the Great.”",
    "It is He who shows you His signs and sends down provision for you from the sky; and no one takes lesson but the one who turns to Him.",
    "So, worship Allah, making your submission exclusive for Him, even though the disbelievers dislike (it).",
    "He is High in stations, the Lord of the Throne. He sends the spirit down, under His command, on whomever He wills from among His servants, so that he warns of the Day of Encounter -",
    "the day they will come in open view. Nothing about them will remain hidden from Allah. To whom belongs the kingdom today? To Allah alone, the One, the All-Dominant.",
    "Today, everyone will be recompensed for what one earned. There is no injustice today. Surely, Allah is swift in reckoning.",
    "And warn them of the Day of approaching horror, when hearts will jump up into the throats, (and they will be) choked. There will be neither a friend for the unjust, nor an intercessor to be listened to.",
    "He knows the treachery of the eyes and whatever is concealed by hearts.",
    "He will give His judgment with truth. And those whom they invoke beside Him cannot judge anything. Surely, it is Allah who is Hearing, Seeing.",
    "Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how was the fate of those who used to be before them? They were stronger than these in power and in traces left on the earth, but Allah seized them because of their sins. There was no one to save them from Allah.",
    "That was because messengers used to come to them with clear signs, but they disbelieved. Then, Allah seized them. Surely, He is Strong, severe in punishment.",
    "Indeed We sent Mūsā with Our signs and a manifest proof",
    "to Pharaoh and Hāmān and Qārūn, but they said, “He is a sorcerer, a liar.”",
    "And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those who have accepted faith with him, and spare the lives of their women.” But the plot of the disbelievers is nothing but a failure.",
    "And Pharaoh said, “Let me kill Mūsā, and let him call his Lord. I am afraid that he will change your religion or he will cause havoc to appear in the land.”",
    "And Mūsā said, “I have sought protection of my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant man who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.”",
    "And said a believing man from the House of Pharaoh who had kept his faith secret, “Would you kill a man because he says - ‘Allah is my Lord’ - while he has come to you with clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lie will fall back on himself, and if he is truthful, some of that (punishment) of which he warns you will afflict you. Indeed, Allah does not give guidance to anyone who is transgressor, a liar.",
    "O my people, the kingdom is yours today, while you are dominant on the land. But, who is going to help us against Allah’s punishment, if it comes upon us?” Pharaoh said, “I do not give you an opinion unless I myself believe it to be correct, and I do not direct you to anything but to the right way.”",
    "Said he who had believed, “I fear for you something like a day of the (disbelieving) groups (of the past),",
    "like the fate of the people of NūH and ‘Ād and Thamūd and those who were after them - and Allah does not intend to do any injustice to His servants.",
    "And O my people, I fear for you a day in which people will call one another,",
    "a day when you will turn back on your heels, having no one to save you from Allah - but, whomever Allah lets go astray, for him there is no one to guide.",
    "And Yūsuf had already come to you earlier with clear signs, but you remained in suspicion about what he brought to you - until when he died, you said, ‘Allah will never send a messenger after him.’ That is how Allah lets go astray anyone who crosses limits and lives in doubt, -",
    "those who quarrel in Allah’s verses without any authority having reached them. It is terribly hateful with Allah and with those who believe. That is how Allah stamps a seal on the entire heart of an arrogant tyrant.”",
    "And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said, “O Hāmān, make a tower for me, perhaps I could reach the ways -",
    "the ways to the heavens, and peek towards the God of Mūsā. And indeed I deem him a liar.” That is how his evil deeds were made attractive to Fir‘aun, and (how) he was held back from the way. The evil design of Fir‘aun was (to end) in nothing but ruin.",
    "And said he who had believed, “O my people, follow me, I will show you the path of guidance.",
    "O my people, this life of the world is only a (momentary) benefit, while the Hereafter is, indeed, the place of permanent living.",
    "The one who does something evil will not be punished but in its equal proportion, but the one who does a righteous deed, be he male or female, while he is a believer, then, such people will enter the Jannah (Paradise) where they will be provided with bounties beyond reckoning.",
    "And O my people, what is wrong with me that I call you to salvation and you call me to the Fire?",
    "You invite me to reject my belief in Allah and ascribe to Him partners about whom I have no knowledge, while I invite you to (Him who is) the Mighty, the Most-Forgiving.",
    "It is obvious that those (gods) to whom you are inviting me are not worth calling, neither in this world nor in the world to come, and that we have to return back to Allah, and that the transgressors are indeed the people of the Fire.",
    "Soon you will remember what I am saying to you. And I entrust my matter with Allah. Surely, Allah has all (His) servants in sight.”",
    "Then Allah saved him from the evils of what they designed, and the House of Pharaoh was encircled by an evil punishment.",
    "It is the Fire before which they are presented morning and evening. And on the day when the Hour (of final judgment) will take place, (the order will be released,): “Admit the family of Pharaoh into the most severe punishment.”",
    "And (worth remembering is the time) when they (the infidels) will argue with each other in the Fire. So, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, “Surely, we used to be your followers, would you, then, stand for us in (suffering at least a) part of the (punishment of) Fire?”",
    "Those who were arrogant will say, “We all are in it. Allah has already passed the judgment between (His) servants.",
    "And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Jahannam (Hell), “Pray to your Lord to lighten the punishment for us some day.”",
    "They will say, “Had your messengers not been coming to you with open signs?” They will say, “Of course, (they had come).” They (the keepers) will say, “Then, keep praying” - but praying of disbelievers (in the Hereafter) is only in vain.",
    "Surely, We do help Our messengers and the believers, in the worldly life, as well as (we will help them) on the day in which witnesses will stand (to give their testimony)-",
    "a day when apology of the unjust will bring them no benefit, and on them shall be the curse, and for them will be the evil abode.",
    "We gave Guidance to Mūsā, while We made the children of Isrā’īl inherit the Book -",
    "as a guide and advice for people of understanding.",
    "So, be patient - surely the promise of Allah is true - and seek forgiveness for your sins, and proclaim the purity and praise of your Lord in the afternoon and at dawn.",
    "Surely, those who quarrel in Allah’s verses without any authority having reached them, there is nothing in their hearts but pride of greatness that they are not (able) to reach. So, seek refuge with Allah. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.",
    "Certainly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of human beings, but most human beings do not know.",
    "The blind one and the sighted one are not equal, and those who believed and did good deeds and the evil ones are not (equal) either. Little you heed to the advice!",
    "Certainly, the Hour is bound to come. There is no doubt in it, but most of the people do not believe.",
    "Your Lord has said, “Call Me, I will respond to you. Definitely those who show arrogance against worshipping Me shall enter Jahannam (Hell) with disgrace.",
    "Allah is the One who made for you the night, so that you may have rest in it, and the day to let you see. Surely, Allah is most kind to people, but most of the people do not offer gratitude.",
    "This is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything. There is no god but He. Then, from where are you being reversed (by your selfish desires)?",
    "Similarly reversed were those who used to deny Our verses.",
    "Allah is the One who made for you the earth a place to live, and the sky a roof, and shaped you, and made your shapes so good - and provided you with a lot of good things. That is Allah, your Lord. So, Glorious is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.",
    "He is Ever-living. There is no god but He. So worship Him making your submission exclusive for Him. All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.",
    "Say, “I have been ordered not to worship those whom you invoke beside Allah when clear signs from my Lord have (already) come to me, and I have been ordered that I should submit to the Lord of the worlds.”",
    "He is the One who created you from dust, then from a drop of semen, then from a clot. After that, He takes you out as an infant. Then, (He makes you grow) so that you reach your full maturity, and, thereafter, become old - and some of you die earlier - and so that you reach the appointed term, and so that you understand.",
    "He is the One who gives life and brings death, and when He decides to do something, He only says to it: “Be” and it comes to be.",
    "Have you not seen those who quarrel in Allah’s verses? From where are they being turned away (by their selfish desires?)",
    "- those who rejected the Book and what We sent with Our messengers. So, they will soon come to know,",
    "when shackles will be round their necks, and chains. They will be dragged",
    "into the hot water after which they will be thrown into the Fire as a fuel.",
    "Then, it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you used to associate (in worship)",
    "beside Allah?” They will say, “They are lost to us, rather, we used to invoke nothing at all.” This is how Allah makes disbelievers get lost.",
    "(It will be said to them,) “This is because you used to rejoice on the earth wrongfully, and because you used to show arrogance.",
    "Enter the gates of Jahannam to live in it forever. So, how evil is the abode of the arrogant.",
    "Therefore, be patient. Surely, Allah’s promise is true. Then, (O Prophet,) whether We show you (in your life) a part of the promise We are making to them, or make you die (before they are punished), in any case they have to be returned to Us.",
    "We had sent messengers before you. Among them there are those whose history We have narrated to you, and of them there are those whose history We did not narrate to you. And it is not up to a messenger that he could come up with a sign without permission from Allah. So, when the command of Allah will come, matters will stand decided justly, and on that occasion all adherents of falsehood will turn into losers.",
    "Allah is the One who made for you the cattle, so that you may ride some of them,- and of them you eat;",
    "and for you there are (other) benefits in them- and so that, (by riding) on them, you meet any need you have in your hearts; and on them and on boats you are carried.",
    "He shows you His signs. Then, which of the signs of Allah would you (still) deny?",
    "Have they not traveled through the earth and seen how was the fate of those before them? Most of them were more in numbers than these, and superior in vigor and vestiges left on the earth. So then, whatever they used to earn did not work for them at all.",
    "When their messengers came to them with manifest signs, they exulted because of whatever knowledge they had, and they were encircled by what they used to ridicule.",
    "When they saw Our punishment, they said, “We have (now) come to believe in Allah alone, and We have rejected everything we used to ascribe (to Him) as partners.”",
    "But, their profession of faith was not (competent) to benefit them, once they had seen Our punishment - a customary practice of Allah that has been there all along in the matter of His servants - and hence, the disbelievers became the losers.",
    "Hā Mīm",
    "This is a revelation from the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful-",
    "- a book whose verses are elaborated in the form of an Arabic Qur’ān for a people who understand,",
    "as a bearer of good news and warning. Yet most of them turned away, so they do not listen.",
    "And they say, “Our hearts are (wrapped) in covers against that (faith) to which you invite us, and there is deafness in our ears, and there is a barrier between you and us. So, do (in your way). We too are doing (in our own way)”.",
    "Say, “I am but a human being like you; it is revealed to me that your god is only One God. So, turn straight towards Him, and seek forgiveness from Him, and woe to the Mushriks (those who ascribe partners to Allah)",
    "who do not pay Zakāh ; and of the life of the Hereafter, they are deniers.”",
    "As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them there is a reward that will never be interrupted.",
    "Say, “Do you really disbelieve in the One who has created the earth in two days, and ascribe to Him partners? That is the Lord of the worlds.",
    "He has placed firm mountains in it (the earth) towering above it, and put blessings in it, and proportioned its foods therein, in four days, equal for those who ask.",
    "Then He turned straight to the sky, while it was a smoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come (to My obedience), both of you, willingly or unwillingly.” Both said, “We come willingly.”",
    "So He accomplished them as seven skies in two days, and settled in every sky its (due) thing. And We have decorated the closest sky with lamps, and protected it properly. All this is the determination of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.",
    "So, if they turn away, then say, “I have warned you of a calamity like the calamity of ‘Ād and Thamūd,",
    "when the messengers came to them from their front and from their rear, saying, “Do not worship anyone but Allah.” They said, “Had our Lord (really) willed (to send someone as messenger), He would have sent down angels. So, we are deniers of what you have been sent with.”",
    "As for ‘Ād, they showed arrogance in the land with no right (to do so), and said, “Who is stronger than us in power?” Did they not see that Allah, who created them, is stronger than them in power? And they used to reject Our signs.",
    "So, We let loose a wild wind on them in unlucky days to make them taste the humiliating punishment in the present life. And of course, the punishment of the Hereafter will be much more humiliating, and they will not be helped.",
    "As for Thamūd, We showed them the way, but they preferred blindness to the guidance. Therefore, they were seized by the bang of the abasing punishment because of what they used to earn.",
    "And We saved those who believed and used to be God-fearing.",
    "(Remind them of) the day when Allah’s enemies will be mustered towards the Fire. So they will be kept under control,",
    "until when they will come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will testify against them about what they used to do.",
    "And they will say to their skins, “Why did you testify against us?” They (the skins) will say, “We were made to speak by Allah, the One who has made every thing to speak.” And He had created you the first time, and to Him you are going to be returned.",
    "And you had not been hiding your selves (when committing sins) from your ears and your eyes and your skins that would bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know much of what you did.",
    "This thought of yours that you conceived about your Lord brought you to ruin, and you became among the losers.",
    "Now, if they endure patiently, even then the Fire is their abode, and if they seek forgiveness, they are not among those (who could be) forgiven.",
    "And We had assigned for them fellows (in the worldly life) who beautified for them what was before them and what was behind them. And (thus) the word (of punishment) became due against them along with the communities that passed before them from Jinns and human beings. Surely they were the losers.",
    "And said those who disbelieved, “Do not listen to this Qur’ān, and make noise during its recitation, so that you may overcome.”",
    "So, We will certainly make them taste a severe punishment, and will certainly recompense them for the worst of what they used to do.",
    "That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah- the Fire. For them there is the eternal home, as a recompense for their persistent denial of Our verses.",
    "And those who disbelieve will say, “Our Lord, show us the two, out of the Jinns and the humans, who led us astray and we will put both of them under our feet, so that they become among the lowest.”",
    "Surely, those who have declared: “Our Lord is Allah”, then remained steadfast, on them the angels will descend, saying, “Do not fear, and do not grieve; and be happy with the good news of the Jannah (Paradise) that you had been promised.",
    "We have been your friends in the worldly life, and (will remain as such) in the Hereafter. And for you here is whatever your souls desire, and for you here is whatever you call for",
    "- a gift of welcome from the Most-forgiving, the Very-Merciful”.",
    "Who can be better in words than the one who calls towards Allah, and acts righteously and says, “I am one of those who submit themselves (to Allah)”?",
    "Good and evil are not equal. Repel (evil) with what is best, and you will see that the one you had mutual enmity with him will turn as if he were a close friend.",
    "And no one is blessed with this (attitude) but those who observe patience, and no one is blessed with this (attitude) but a man of great luck.",
    "And should a stroke from ShaiTān (Satan) strike you, seek refuge with Allah. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun, or to the moon. And prostrate yourselves to Allah who has created them, if it is Him whom you worship.",
    "Still, if they show arrogance, then those who are with your Lord proclaim His purity night and day, and they do not get weary.",
    "And among His signs is that you see the land inactive; then, once We send down water thereto, it gets excited and swells. Surely, the One who has given life to it is the One who gives life to the dead. No doubt, He is powerful to do everything.",
    "Surely those who adopt perversity about Our verses are not hidden from Us. So, tell me which one is better: the one who is thrown into the Fire, or the one who will come safely on the Day of Judgment? Do whatever you wish. He is watchful of whatever you do.",
    "Surely those who have rejected the advice (the Qur’ān) when it came to them (are the ones who adopted perversity, and are not hidden from Us). And surely, it is an unassailable book",
    "that cannot be approached by falsehood, neither from its front, nor from its behind -a revelation from the All-Wise, the Ever-Praised.",
    "Nothing is being said to you but what has been said to the messengers before you. Your Lord is certainly the Lord of forgiveness and the Lord of painful punishment.",
    "Had We made it a non-Arabic Qur’ān, they would have said, “Why are its verses not clearly explained? Is it a non-Arabic (book) and an Arab (messenger)?” Say, “For those who believe, it is guidance and cure. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears, and for them it is blindness. Such people are being called from a distant place.”",
    "And We gave Mūsā the book, then it was disputed (as well). But for a word that had already come from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them. They are in confounding doubt about it.",
    "If someone acts righteously, he does so for the benefit of his own soul, and if someone commits evil, he does so against it. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants."
