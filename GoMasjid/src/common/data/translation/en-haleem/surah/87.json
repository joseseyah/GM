    "[Prophet], We shall teach you [the Quran] and you will not forget––",
    "unless God wishes; He knows both what is open and what is hidden––",
    "We shall show you the easy way.",
    "So remind, if reminding will help.",
    "Those who stand in awe of God will heed the reminder,",
    "but it will be ignored by the most wicked,",
    "who will enter the Great Fire,",
    "where they will neither die nor live.",
    "Prosperous are those who purify themselves,",
    "remember the name of their Lord, and pray.",
    "Yet you [people] prefer the life of this world,",
    "even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting.",
    "All this is in the earlier scriptures,",
    "the scriptures of Abraham and Moses."
