    "Alif Lam Ra This is a Scripture which We have sent down to you [Prophet] so that, with their Lord’s permission, you may bring people from the depths of darkness into light, to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy One,",
    "God, to whom everything in the heavens and earth belongs. How terrible will be the torment of those who ignore [Him],",
    "those who prefer the life of this world over the life to come, who turn others from God’s way, trying to make it crooked: such people have gone far astray.",
    "We have never sent a messenger who did not use his own people’s language to make things clear for them. But still God leaves whoever He will to stray, and guides whoever He will: He is the Almighty, the All Wise.",
    "We sent Moses with Our signs: ‘Bring out your people from the depths of darkness into light. Remind them of the Days of God:there truly are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful person.’",
    "And so Moses said to his people, ‘Remember God’s blessing on you when He saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who were inflicting terrible suffering on you, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your women––that was a severe test from your Lord!",
    "Remember that He promised, “If you are thankful, I will give you more, but if you are thankless, My punishment is terrible indeed.” ’",
    "And Moses said, ‘Even if you, together with everybody else on earth, are thankless, God is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise.’",
    "Have you not heard about those who went before you, the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who lived after them, known only to God? Their messengers came to them with clear proof, but they tried to silence them, saying, ‘We do not believe the message with which you were sent. We have disturbing doubts about what you are asking us to do.’",
    "Their messengers answered, ‘Can there be any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and earth? He calls you to Him in order to forgive you your sins and let you enjoy your life until the appointed hour.’ But they said, ‘You are only men like us. You want to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship. Bring us clear proof then, [if you can].’",
    "Their messengers answered, ‘True, we are only men like you, but God favours whichever of His servants He chooses. We cannot bring you any proof unless God permits it, so let the believers put all their trust in Him-",
    "why should we not put our trust in God when it is He who has guided us to this way we follow? We shall certainly bear steadfastly whatever harm you do to us. Let anyone who trusts, trust in God.’",
    "The disbelievers said to their messengers, ‘We shall expel you from our land unless you return to our religion.’ But their Lord inspired the messengers: ‘We shall destroy the evildoers,",
    "and leave you to dwell in the land after them. This reward is for those who are in awe of meeting Me, and of My warnings.’",
    "They asked God to decide, and every obstinate tyrant failed-",
    "Hell awaits each one; he will be given foul water to drink,",
    "which he will try to gulp but scarcely be able to swallow; death will encroach on him from every side, but he will not die; more intense suffering will lie ahead of him.",
    "The deeds of those who reject their Lord are like ashes that the wind blows furiously on a stormy day: they have no power over anything they have gained. This is to stray far, far away.",
    "[Prophet], do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth for a purpose? He could remove all of you and replace you with a new creation if He wished to:",
    "that is not difficult for God.",
    "When they all appear before Him, the weak will say to the powerseekers, ‘We were your followers. Can you protect us from any of God’s punishment?’ They will reply, ‘If God had guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference now whether we rage or endure with patience: there is no escape.’",
    "When everything has been decided, Satan will say, ‘God gave you a true promise. I too made promises but they were false ones: I had no power over you except to call you, and you responded to my call, so do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I reject the way you associated me with God before.’ A bitter torment awaits such wrongdoers,",
    "but those who believed and did good deeds will be brought into Gardens graced with flowing streams, there to remain with their Lord’s permission: their greeting there is ‘Peace’.",
    "[Prophet], do you not see how God makes comparisons? A good word is like a good tree whose root is firm and whose branches are high in the sky,",
    "yielding constant fruit by its Lord’s leave- God makes such comparisons for people so that they may reflect-",
    "but an evil word is like a rotten tree, uprooted from the surface of the earth, with no power to endure.",
    "God will give firmness to those who believe in the firmly rooted word, both in this world and the Hereafter, but the evildoers He leaves to stray: God does whatever He will.",
    "[Prophet], do you not see those who, in exchange for God’s favour, offer only ingratitude and make their people end up in the home of ruin, Hell,",
    "where they burn? What an evil place to stay!",
    "They set up [false deities] as God’s equals to lead people astray from His path. Say, ‘Take your pleasure now, for your destination is the Fire.’",
    "Tell My servants who have believed to keep up the prayer and give, secretly and in public, out of what We have provided them, before a Day comes when there will be no trading or friendship.",
    "It is God who created the heavens and earth, who has sent down water from the sky and with it brought forth produce to nourish you; He has made ships useful to you, sailing the sea by His command, and the rivers too;",
    "He has made the sun and the moon useful to you, steady on their paths; He has made the night and day useful to you",
    "and given you some of everything you asked Him for. If you tried to count God’s favours you could never calculate them: man is truly unjust and ungrateful.",
    "Remember when Abraham said, ‘Lord, make this town safe! Preserve me and my offspring from idolatry,",
    "Lord, the [idols] have led many people astray! Anyone who follows me is with me, but as for anyone who disobeys me- You are surely forgiving and merciful.",
    "Our Lord, I have established some of my offspring in an uncultivated valley, close to Your Sacred House, Lord, so that they may keep up the prayer. Make people’s hearts turn to them, and provide them with produce, so that they may be thankful.",
    "Our Lord, You know well what we conceal and what we reveal: nothing at all is hidden from God, on earth or in heaven.",
    "Praise be to God, who has granted me Ishmael and Isaac in my old age: my Lord hears all requests!",
    "Lord, grant that I and my offspring may keep up the prayer. Our Lord, accept my request.",
    "Our Lord, forgive me, my parents, and the believers on the Day of Reckoning.’",
    "Do not think [Prophet] that God is unaware of what the disbelievers do: He only gives them respite until a Day when their eyes will stare in terror.",
    "They will rush forward, craning their necks, unable to divert their eyes, a gaping void in their hearts.",
    "So warn people of the Day when punishment will come to them, and when the disbelievers will say, ‘Our Lord, give us a little more time: we shall answer Your call and follow the messengers.’ Did you [disbelievers] not swear in the past that your power would have no end?",
    "You lived in the same places as others who wronged themselves before, and you were clearly shown how We dealt with them––We gave you many examples.",
    "They made their plots, but, even if their plots had been able to move mountains, God had the answer.",
    "So do not think [Prophet] that God will break His promise to His messengers: He is mighty, and capable of retribution.",
    "One Day- when the earth is turned into another earth, the heavens into another heaven, and people all appear before God, the One, the Overpowering-",
    "you [Prophet] will see the guilty on that Day, bound together in fetters,",
    "in garments of pitch, faces covered in fire.",
    "[All will be judged] so that God may reward each soul as it deserves: God is swift in His reckoning.",
    "This is a message to all people, so that they may be warned by it, and know that He is the only God, and so that those who have minds may take heed."
