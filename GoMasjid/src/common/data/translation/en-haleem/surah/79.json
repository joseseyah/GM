    "By the forceful chargers",
    "raring to go,",
    "sweeping ahead at full stretch,",
    "overtaking swiftly",
    "to bring the matter to an end,",
    "on the Day when the blast reverberates",
    "and the second blast follows,",
    "hearts will tremble",
    "and eyes will be downcast.",
    "They say, ‘What? shall we be brought back to life,",
    "after we have turned into decayed bones?’ and they say,",
    "‘Such a return is impossible!’",
    "But all it will take is a single blast,",
    "and they will be back above ground.",
    "Have you [Prophet] heard the story of Moses?",
    "His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:",
    "‘Go to Pharaoh, for he has exceeded all bounds,",
    "and ask him, “Do you want to purify yourself [of sin]?",
    "Do you want me to guide you to your Lord, so that you may hold Him in awe?” ’",
    "Moses showed him the great sign,",
    "but he denied it and refused [the faith].",
    "He turned away and hastily",
    "gathered his people, proclaiming,",
    "‘I am your supreme lord,’",
    "so God condemned him to punishment in the life to come as well as in this life:",
    "there truly is a lesson in this for anyone who stands in awe of God.",
    "Which is harder to create: you people or the sky that He built,",
    "raising it high and perfecting it,",
    "giving darkness to its night and bringing out its morning brightness,",
    "and the earth, too, He spread out,",
    "bringing waters and pastures out of it,",
    "and setting firm mountains [in it]",
    "for you and your animals to enjoy?",
    "When the great overwhelming event arrives",
    "on the Day that man remembers what he has done",
    "and Hell is there for all to see,",
    "for anyone who has transgressed",
    "and preferred the present life",
    "Hell will be home;",
    "for anyone who feared the meeting with his Lord and restrained himself from base desires,",
    "Paradise will be home.",
    "They ask you [Prophet] about the Hour,",
    "saying, ‘When will it arrive?’, but how can you tell [them that]?",
    "Its time is known only to your Lord;",
    "you are only sent to warn those who fear it.",
    "On the Day they see it, it will seem they lingered [in this life] an evening [at most,] or its morning."
