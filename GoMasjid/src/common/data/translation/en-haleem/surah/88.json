    "Have you heard tell [Prophet] about the Overwhelming Event?",
    "On that Day, there will be downcast faces,",
    "toiling and weary,",
    "as they enter the blazing Fire",
    "and are forced to drink from a boiling spring,",
    "with no food for them except bitter dry thorns",
    "that neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.",
    "On that Day there will also be faces radiant with bliss,",
    "well pleased with their labour,",
    "in a lofty garden,",
    "where they will hear no idle talk,",
    "with a flowing spring,",
    "raised couches,",
    "goblets placed before them,",
    "cushions set in rows,",
    "and carpets spread.",
    "Do the disbelievers not see how rain clouds are formed 1",
    "how the heavens are lifted,",
    "how the mountains are raised high,",
    "how the earth is spread out?",
    "So [Prophet] warn them: your only task is to give warning,",
    "you are not there to control them.",
    "As for those who turn away and disbelieve,",
    "God will inflict the greatest torment upon them.",
    "It is to Us they will return,",
    "and then it is for Us to call them to account."
