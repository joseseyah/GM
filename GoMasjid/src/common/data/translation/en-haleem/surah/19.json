    "Kaf Ha Ya 'Ayn Sad",
    "This is an account of your Lord’s grace towards His servant, Zachariah,",
    "when he called to his Lord secretly, saying,",
    "‘Lord, my bones have weakened and my hair is ashen grey, but never, Lord, have I ever prayed to You in vain:",
    "I fear [what] my kinsmen [will do] when I am gone, for my wife is barren, so grant me a successor––a gift from You––",
    "to be my heir and the heir of the family of Jacob. Lord, make him well pleasing [to You].’",
    "‘Zachariah, We bring you good news of a son whose name will be John––We have chosen this name for no one before him.’",
    "He said, ‘Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I am old and frail?’",
    "He said, ‘This is what your Lord has said: “It is easy for Me: I created you, though you were nothing before.” ’",
    "He said, ‘Give me a sign, Lord.’ He said, ‘Your sign is that you will not [be able to] speak to anyone for three full [days and] nights.’",
    "He went out of the sanctuary to his people and signalled to them to praise God morning and evening.",
    "[We said], ‘John, hold on to the Scripture firmly.’ While he was still a boy, We granted him wisdom,",
    "tenderness from Us, and purity. He was devout,",
    "kind to his parents, not domineering or rebellious.",
    "Peace was on him the day he was born, the day he died, and it will be on him the day he is raised to life again.",
    "Mention in the Quran the story of Mary. She withdrew from her family to a place to the east",
    "and secluded herself away; We sent Our Spirit to appear before her in the form of a perfected man.",
    "She said, ‘I seek the Lord of Mercy’s protection against you: if you have any fear of Him [do not approach]!’",
    "but he said, ‘I am but a Mes-senger from your Lord, [come] to announce to you the gift of a pure son.’",
    "She said, ‘How can I have a son when no man has touched me? I have not been unchaste,’",
    "and he said, ‘This is what your Lord said: “It is easy for Me- We shall make him a sign to all people, a blessing from Us.”’",
    "And so it was ordained: she conceived him. She withdrew to a distant place",
    "and, when the pains of childbirth drove her to [cling to] the trunk of a palm tree, she exclaimed, ‘I wish I had been dead and forgotten long before all this!’",
    "but a voice cried to her from below, ‘Do not worry: your Lord has provided a stream at your feet",
    "and, if you shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, it will deliver fresh ripe dates for you,",
    "so eat, drink, be glad, and say to anyone you may see: “I have vowed to the Lord of Mercy to abstain from conversation, and I will not talk to anyone today.”’",
    "She went back to her people carrying the child, and they said, ‘Mary! You have done something terrible!",
    "Sister of Aaron! Your father was not an evil man; your mother was not unchaste!’",
    "She pointed at him. They said, ‘How can we converse with an infant?’",
    "[But] he said: ‘I am a servant of God. He has granted me the Scripture; made me a prophet;",
    "made me blessed wherever I may be. He commanded me to pray, to give alms as long as I live,",
    "to cherish my mother. He did not make me domineering or graceless.",
    "Peace was on me the day I was born, and will be on me the day I die and the day I am raised to life again.’",
    "Such was Jesus, son of Mary. [This is] a statement of the Truth about which they are in doubt:",
    "it would not befit God to have a child. He is far above that: when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be,’ and it is.",
    "‘God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him: that is a straight path.’",
    "But factions have differed among themselves. What suffering will come to those who obscure the truth when a dreadful Day arrives!",
    "How sharp of hearing, how sharp of sight they will be when they come to Us, although now they are clearly off course! Warn them [Muhammad] of the Day of Remorse when the matter will be decided,",
    "for they are heedless and do not believe.",
    "It is We who will inherit the earth and all who are on it: they will all be returned to Us.",
    "Mention too, in the Quran, the story of Abraham. He was a man of truth, a prophet.",
    "He said to his father, ‘Father, why do you worship something that can neither hear nor see nor benefit you in any way?",
    "Father, knowledge that has not reached you has come to me, so follow me: I will guide you to an even path.",
    "Father, do not worship Satan- Satan has rebelled against the Lord of Mercy.",
    "Father, I fear that a punishment from the Lord of Mercy may afflict you and that you may become Satan’s companion [in Hell].’",
    "His father answered, ‘Abraham, do you reject my gods? I will stone you if you do not stop this. Keep out of my way!’",
    "Abraham said, ‘Peace be with you: I will beg my Lord to forgive you- He is always gracious to me-",
    "but for now I will leave you, and the idols you all pray to, and I will pray to my Lord and trust that my prayer will not be in vain.’",
    "When he left his people and those they served beside God, We granted him Isaac and Jacob and made them both prophets:",
    "We granted Our grace to all of them, and gave them a noble reputation.",
    "Mention too, in the Quran, the story of Moses. He was specially chosen, a messenger and a prophet:",
    "We called to him from the right-hand side of the mountain and brought him close to Us in secret communion;",
    "out of Our grace We granted him his brother Aaron as a prophet.",
    "Mention too, in the Quran, the story of Ishmael. He was true to his promise, a messenger and a prophet.",
    "He commanded his household to pray and give alms, and his Lord was well pleased with him.",
    "Mention too, in the Quran, the story of Idris. He was a man of truth, a prophet.",
    "We raised him to a high position.",
    "These were the prophets God blessed- from the seed of Adam, of those We carried in the Ark with Noah, from the seed of Abraham and Israel- and those We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Lord of Mercy were recited to them, they fell to their knees and wept,",
    "but there came after them generations who neglected prayer and were driven by their own desires. These will come face to face with their evil,",
    "but those who repent, who believe, who do righteous deeds, will enter Paradise. They will not be wronged in the least:",
    "they will enter the Gardens of Lasting Bliss, promised by the Lord of Mercy to His servants- it is not yet seen but truly His promise will be fulfilled.",
    "There they will hear only peaceful talk, nothing bad; there they will be given provision morning and evening.",
    "That is the Garden We shall give as their own to those of Our servants who were devout.",
    "[Gabriel said],‘We only descend [with revelation] at your Lord’s command––everything before us, everything behind us, everything in between, all belongs to Him––your Lord is never forgetful.",
    "He is Lord of the heavens and earth and everything in between so worship Him: be steadfast in worshipping Him. Do you know of anyone equal to Him?’",
    "Man says, ‘What? Once I am dead, will I be brought back to life?’",
    "but does man not remember that We created him when he was nothing before?",
    "By your Lord [Prophet] We shall gather them and the devils together and set them on their knees around Hell;",
    "We shall seize out of each group those who were most disobedient towards the Lord of Mercy-",
    "We know best who most deserves to burn in Hell-",
    "but every single one of you will approach it, a decree from your Lord which must be fulfilled.",
    "We shall save the devout and leave the evildoers there on their knees.",
    "When Our revelations are recited to them in all their clarity, [all that] the disbelievers say to the believers [is], ‘Which side is better situated? Which side has the better following?’",
    "We have destroyed many a generation before them who surpassed them in riches and outward glitter!",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘The Lord of Mercy lengthens [the lives] of the misguided, until, when they are confronted with what they have been warned about- either the punishment [in this life] or the Hour [of Judgement]- they realize who is worse situated and who has the weakest forces.’",
    "But God gives more guidance to those who are guided, and good deeds of lasting merit are best and most rewarding in your Lord’s sight.",
    "Have you considered the man who rejects Our revelation, who says, ‘I will certainly be given wealth and children’?",
    "Has he penetrated the unknown or received a pledge to that effect from the Lord of Mercy?",
    "No! We shall certainly record what he says and prolong his punishment:",
    "We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of and he will come to Us all alone.",
    "They have taken other gods beside God to give them strength,",
    "but these gods will reject their worship and will even turn against them.",
    "Have you [Prophet] not seen how We send devils to incite the disbelievers to sin?",
    "There is no need for you to be impatient concerning them: We are counting down their [allotted] time.",
    "On the Day We gather the righteous as an honoured company before the Lord of Mercy",
    "and drive the sinful like a thirsty herd into Hell,",
    "no one will have power to intercede except for those who have permission from the Lord of Mercy.",
    "The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’",
    "How terrible is this thing you assert:",
    "it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces,",
    "that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy.",
    "It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring]:",
    "there is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant-",
    "He has counted them all: He has numbered them exactly-",
    "and they will each return to Him on the Day of Resurrection all alone.",
    "But the Lord of Mercy will give love to those who believe and do righteous deeds:",
    "We have made it easy, in your own language [Prophet], so that you may bring glad news to the righteous and warnings to a stubborn people.",
    "How many generations We have destroyed before them! Do you perceive a single one of them now, or hear as much as a whisper?"
