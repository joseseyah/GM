    "Such as fear not the meeting with Us (for Judgment) say: \"Why are not the angels sent down to us, or (why) do we not see our Lord?\" Indeed they have an arrogant conceit of themselves, and mighty is the insolence of their impiety!",
    "The Day they see the angels,- no joy will there be to the sinners that Day: The (angels) will say: \"There is a barrier forbidden (to you) altogether!\"",
    "And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did (in this life), and We shall make such deeds as floating dust scattered about.",
    "The Companions of the Garden will be well, that Day, in their abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.",
    "The Day the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and angels shall be sent down, descending (in ranks),-",
    "That Day, the dominion as of right and truth, shall be (wholly) for (Allah) Most Merciful: it will be a Day of dire difficulty for the misbelievers.",
    "The Day that the wrong-doer will bite at his hands, he will say, \"Oh! would that I had taken a (straight) path with the Messenger!",
    "\"Ah! woe is me! Would that I had never taken such a one for a friend!",
    "\"He did lead me astray from the Message (of Allah) after it had come to me! Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man!\"",
    "Then the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur'an for just foolish nonsense.\"",
    "Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help.",
    "Those who reject Faith say: \"Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once? Thus (is it revealed), that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually.",
    "And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof).",
    "Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces,- they will be in an evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray.",
    "(Before this,) We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister;",
    "And We command: \"Go ye both, to the people who have rejected our Signs:\" And those (people) We destroyed with utter destruction.",
    "And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous Penalty;-",
    "As also 'Ad and Thamud, and the Companions of the Rass, and many a generation between them.",
    "To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke to utter annihilation (for their sins).",
    "And the (Unbelievers) must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil: did they not then see it (with their own eyes)? But they fear not the Resurrection.",
    "When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: \"Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger?\"",
    "\"He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not been that we were constant to them!\" - Soon will they know, when they see the Penalty, who it is that is most misled in Path!",
    "Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion (or impulse)? Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him?",
    "Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle;- nay, they are worse astray in Path.",
    "Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide;",
    "Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages.",
    "And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection.",
    "And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,-",
    "That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers.",
    "And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude.",
    "Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre of population.",
    "Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur'an).",
    "It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed.",
    "It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things).",
    "Yet do they worship, besides Allah, things that can neither profit them nor harm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord!",
    "But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition.",
    "Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord.\"",
    "And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-",
    "He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in six days, and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): Allah Most Gracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted (with such things).",
    "When it is said to them, \"Prostrate to (Allah) Most Gracious!\", they say, \"And what is (Allah) Most Gracious? Shall we prostrate to that which thou commandest us?\" And it increases their flight (from the Truth).",
    "Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light;",
    "And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for such as have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude.",
    "And the servants of (Allah) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, \"Peace!\";",
    "Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing;",
    "Those who say, \"Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous,-",
    "\"Evil indeed is it as an abode, and as a place to rest in\";",
    "Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but hold a just (balance) between those (extremes);",
    "Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred except for just cause, nor commit fornication; - and any that does this (not only) meets punishment.",
    "(But) the Penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will dwell therein in ignominy,-",
    "Unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such persons into good, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,",
    "And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an (acceptable) conversion;-",
    "Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass by it with honourable (avoidance);",
    "Those who, when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord, droop not down at them as if they were deaf or blind;",
    "And those who pray, \"Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and give us (the grace) to lead the righteous.\"",
    "Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven, because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutations and peace,",
    "Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!",
    "Say (to the Rejecters): \"My Lord is not uneasy because of you if ye call not on Him: But ye have indeed rejected (Him), and soon will come the inevitable (punishment)!\"",
    "Ta. Sin. Mim.",
    "These are verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.",
    "It may be thou frettest thy soul with grief, that they do not become Believers.",
    "If (such) were Our Will, We could send down to them from the sky a Sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.",
    "But there comes not to them a newly-revealed Message from (Allah) Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.",
    "They have indeed rejected (the Message): so they will know soon (enough) the truth of what they mocked at!",
    "Do they not look at the earth,- how many noble things of all kinds We have produced therein?",
    "Verily, in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.",
    "And verily, thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.",
    "Behold, thy Lord called Moses: \"Go to the people of iniquity,-",
    "\"The people of the Pharaoh: will they not fear Allah?\"",
    "He said: \"O my Lord! I do fear that they will charge me with falsehood:",
    "\"My breast will be straitened. And my speech may not go (smoothly): so send unto Aaron.",
    "\"And (further), they have a charge of crime against me; and I fear they may slay me.\"",
    "Allah said: \"By no means! proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We are with you, and will listen (to your call).",
    "\"So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: 'We have been sent by the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds;",
    "\"'Send thou with us the Children of Israel.'\"",
    "(Pharaoh) said: \"Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life?",
    "\"And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou art an ungrateful (wretch)!\"",
    "Moses said: \"I did it then, when I was in error.",
    "\"So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers.",
    "\"And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel!\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"And what is the 'Lord and Cherisher of the worlds'?\"",
    "(Moses) said: \"The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- if ye want to be quite sure.\"",
    "(Pharaoh) said to those around: \"Did ye not listen (to what he says)?\"",
    "(Moses) said: \"Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!\"",
    "(Pharaoh) said: \"Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable madman!\"",
    "(Moses) said: \"Lord of the East and the West, and all between! if ye only had sense!\"",
    "(Pharaoh) said: \"If thou dost put forward any god other than me, I will certainly put thee in prison!\"",
    "(Moses) said: \"Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing?\"",
    "(Pharaoh) said: \"Show it then, if thou tellest the truth!\"",
    "So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)!",
    "And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!",
    "(Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: \"This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed:",
    "\"His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it ye counsel?\"",
    "They said: \"Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch to the Cities heralds to collect-",
    "\"And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed.\"",
    "So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known,",
    "And the people were told: \"Are ye (now) assembled?-",
    "\"That we may follow the sorcerers (in religion) if they win?\"",
    "So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: \"Of course - shall we have a (suitable) reward if we win?",
    "He said: \"Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person).\"",
    "Moses said to them: \"Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw!\"",
    "So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: \"By the might of Pharaoh, it is we who will certainly win!\"",
    "Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the falsehoods which they fake!",
    "Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration,",
    "Saying: \"We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,",
    "\"The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"",
    "Said (Pharaoh): \"Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? surely he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know! Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross!\"",
    "They said: \"No matter! for us, we shall but return to our Lord!",
    "\"Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may become foremost among the believers!\"",
    "By inspiration we told Moses: \"Travel by night with my servants; for surely ye shall be pursued.\"",
    "Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities,",
    "(Saying): \"These (Israelites) are but a small band,",
    "\"And they are raging furiously against us;",
    "\"But we are a multitude amply fore-warned.\"",
    "So We expelled them from gardens, springs,",
    "Treasures, and every kind of honourable position;",
    "Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things.",
    "So they pursued them at sunrise.",
    "And when the two bodies saw each other, the people of Moses said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\"",
    "(Moses) said: \"By no means! my Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me!\"",
    "Then We told Moses by inspiration: \"Strike the sea with thy rod.\" So it divided, and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.",
    "And We made the other party approach thither.",
    "We delivered Moses and all who were with him;",
    "But We drowned the others.",
    "Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.",
    "And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.",
    "And rehearse to them (something of) Abraham's story.",
    "Behold, he said to his father and his people: \"What worship ye?\"",
    "They said: \"We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on them.\"",
    "He said: \"Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)?\"",
    "\"Or do you good or harm?\"",
    "They said: \"Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do).\"",
    "He said: \"Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping,-",
    "\"Ye and your fathers before you?-",
    "\"For they are enemies to me; not so the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds;",
    "\"Who created me, and it is He Who guides me;",
    "\"Who gives me food and drink,",
    "\"And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me;",
    "\"Who will cause me to die, and then to life (again);",
    "\"And who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the day of Judgment.",

    "\"Grant me honourable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);",
    "\"Make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss;",
    "\"Forgive my father, for that he is among those astray;",
    "\"And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;-",
    "\"The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,",

    "\"Then they will be thrown headlong into the (Fire),- they and those straying in Evil,",
    "\"And the whole hosts of Iblis together.",

    "\"'By Allah, we were truly in an error manifest,",

    "The people of Noah rejected the messengers.",

    "\"So fear Allah, and obey me.",
    "\"No reward do I ask of you for it: my reward is only from the Lord of the Worlds:",

    "They said: \"Shall we believe in thee when it is the meanest that follow thee?\"",

    "The people of Lut rejected the messengers.",

    "And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks.",
    "At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: \"O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.\"",
    "So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: \"O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants.\"",
    "And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: \"Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?",
    "\"I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence).\"",
    "But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: \"I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true.",
    "\"I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne.",
    "\"I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path,- so they receive no guidance,-",
    "\"(Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal.",
    "\"Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!\"",
    "(Solomon) said: \"Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!",
    "\"Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return\"...",
    "(The queen) said: \"Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect.",
    "\"It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): 'In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful:",
    "\"'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).'\"",
    "She said: \"Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence.\"",
    "They said: \"We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command.\"",
    "She said: \"Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave.",
    "\"But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors.\"",
    "Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: \"Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!",
    "\"Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed).\"",
    "He said (to his own men): \"Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?\"",
    "Said an 'Ifrit, of the Jinns: \"I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted.\"",
    "Said one who had knowledge of the Book: \"I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!\" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!\"",
    "He said: \"Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance.\"",
    "So when she arrived, she was asked, \"Is this thy throne?\" She said, \"It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam).\"",
    "And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith.",
    "She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: \"This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass.\" She said: \"O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds.\"",
    "We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, \"Serve Allah\": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other.",
    "He said: \"O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy.",
    "They said: \"Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee\". He said: \"Your ill omen is with Allah; yea, ye are a people under trial.\"",
    "There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.",
    "They said: \"Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth.'\"",
    "They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not.",
    "Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them).",
    "Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong-doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge.",
    "And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness.",
    "(We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, \"Do ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)?",
    "Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant!",
    "But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, \"Drive out the followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!\"",
    "But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lagged behind.",
    "And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!",
    "Say: Praise be to Allah, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for his Message). (Who) is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate (with Him)?"
