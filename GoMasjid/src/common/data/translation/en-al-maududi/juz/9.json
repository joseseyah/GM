    "The haughty elders of his people said: 'O Shu'ayb! We shall certainly banish you and your companions-in-faith from our town, or else you shall return to our faith.' Shu'ayb said: 'What! Even though we abhor [your faith]?",
    "If we return to your faith after Allah has delivered us from it we would be fabricating a lie against Allah. nor can we return to it again unless it be by, the will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has knowledge of all things, and in Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Judge rightly between us and our people, for You are the best of those who judge.'",
    "The elders of his people who disbelieved said: 'Should you follow Shu'ayb, you will be utter losers.",
    "Thereupon a shocking catastrophe seized them, and they remained prostrate in their dwellings.",
    "Those who had charged Shu'ayb with lying became as though-they had never lived there; it is they who became utter losers.",
    "Shu'ayb then departed from his people, and said: ' my people! Surely I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and gave you sincere advice. How, then, can I mourn for a people who refuse to accept the truth?'",
    "Never have We sent a Prophet to a place without trying its people with adversity and hardship that they may humble themselves.",
    "Then We changed adversity into ease until they throve and said: 'Our forefathers had also seen both adversity and prosperity.' So We suddenly seized them without their even perceiving it.",
    "Had the people of those towns believed and been God-fearing, We would certainly have opened up to them blessings from the heavens and the earth; but they gave the lie [to their Prophets] and so We seized them for their deeds. so.",
    "Do the people of those towns feel secure that Our punishment will not come to them at night while they are asleep?",
    "Or, do the people of those towns feel secure that Our punishment will not come to them by daylight while they are at play?",
    "Do they feel secure against the design of Allah None can feel secure against the design of Allah except the utter losers.",
    "Has it not, then, become plain to those who have inherited the earth in the wake of the former generations that, had We so willed, We could have afflicted them for their sins, (they, however, are heedless to basic facts and so) We seal their hearts so that they hear nothing.",
    "To those [earlier] communities - some of whose stories We relate to you - there had indeed come Messengers with clear proofs, but they would not believe what they had once rejected as false. Thus it is that Allah seals the hearts of those who deny the truth.",
    "We did not find most of them true to their covenants; indeed We found most of them to he transgressors. ",
    "After those We sent forth Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his nobles, but they dealt with Our signs unjustly. Observe, then, what happened to the mischief-makers.",
    "And Moses said: ' Pharaoh! I am a Messenger from the Lord of the universe.",
    "And it behoves me to say nothing about Allah except what is true. I have come to you with a clear sign of having been sent from your Lord. So let the Children of Israel go with me.'",
    "Pharaoh said: if you have brought a sign, then bring it forth if you are truthful.'",
    "Thereupon Moses threw his rod, and suddenly it was a veritable serpent.",
    "Then he drew out his hand, and it appeared luminous to all beholders.",
    "The elders of Pharaoh's people said: 'Surely this man is a skilful magician",
    "who seeks to drive you out from your land. What would you have us do?'",
    "Then they advised Pharaoh: 'Put off Moses and his brother for a while, and send forth heralds to your cities",
    "to summon every skilful magician to your presence.'",
    "And the magicians came to Pharaoh and said: 'Shall we have a reward if we win?'",
    "Pharaoh replied: 'Certainly, and you shall be among those who are near to me.'",
    "Then they said: ' Moses, will you [first] throw your rod, or shall we throw?'",
    "Moses said: 'You throw.' So when they threw [their rods], they enchanted the eyes of the people, and struck them with awe, and produced a mighty sorcery.",
    "Then We directed Moses: 'Now you throw your rod.' And lo! it swallowed up all their false devices.",
    "Thus was the truth established, and their doings proved in vain.",
    "Pharaoh and his men were defeated and put to shame,",
    "and the magicians flung themselves prostrate,",
    "saying: 'We believe in the Lord of the universe,",
    "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.'",
    "Pharaoh said: 'What! Do you believe before you have my permission? Surely this is a plot you have contrived to drive out the rulers from the capital. So you shall see,",
    "I shall cut off your hands and feet on the opposite sides, and then crucify you all.'",
    "They replied: 'We shall surely return to our Lord.",
    "Will you punish us just because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us? Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance and cause us to die as those who have submitted [to You].'",
    "The elders of Pharaoh's people said: 'Will you leave alone Moses and his people to spread mischief in the land, and forsake you and your gods?' Pharaoh replied: 'We will kill their male children and spare their female ones. For indeed we hold irresistible sway over them.'",
    "Moses said to his people: 'Seek help from Allah and be steadfast. The earth is Allah's, He bestows it on those of His servants He chooses. The end of things belongs to the God-fearing.'",
    "The people of Moses replied: 'We were oppressed before your coming to us and after it.' Moses said: 'Your Lord will soon destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land. Then He will see how you act.'",
    "We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with hard times and with poor harvest that they may heed.",
    "But whenever prosperity came their way, they said: 'This is our due.' And whatever hardship befell them, they attributed it to the misfortune of Moses and those who followed him. Surely, their misfortune had been decreed by Allah - but most of them do not know that.",
    "And they said to Moses: 'Whatever sign you might produce before us in order to enchant us, we are not going to believe you.'",
    "Then We afflicted them with a great flood  and locusts, and the lice , and the frogs, and the blood. All these were distinct signs and yet they remained haughty. They were a wicked people.",
    "Each time a scourge struck them they, said: ' Moses! Pray for us to your Lord on the strength of the prophethood He has bestowed upon you. Surely, if you remove this scourge from us, we will truly believe in you, and will let the Children of Israel go with you.'",
    "But when We removed the scourge from them until a term - a term which they were bound to reach - they at once broke their promise.",
    "So We inflicted Our retribution on them, and caused them to drown in the sea because they gave the lie to Our signs and were heedless of them.",
    "And We made those who had been persecuted inherit the eastern and western lands which We had blessed. Thus your Lord's gracious promise was fulfilled to the Children of Israel, for they had endured with patience; and We destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people had wrought, and all that they had built.",
    "And We led the Children of Israel across the sea; and then they came upon a people who were devoted to the worship of their idols. They said: ' Moses, make for us a god even as they have gods.' Moses said: 'You are indeed an ignorant people.'",
    "The way these people follow is bound to lead to destruction; and all their works are vain.",
    "Moses said: 'Should I seek any god for you other than Allah although it is He who has exalted you above all?'",
    "And call to mind when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who perpetrated on you a terrible torment, putting your males to death and sparing your females. Surely in it there was an awesome trial for you from your Lord.",
    "And We appointed for Moses thirty nights, to which We added ten, whereby the term of forty nights set by his Lord was fulfilled. And Moses said to Aaron, his brother: 'Take my place among my people, act righteously, and do not follow the path of those who create mischief.'",
    "And when Moses came at Our appointment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said: 'O my Lord! Reveal Yourself to me, that I may look upon You!' He replied: 'Never can you see Me. However, behold this mount; if it remains firm in its place, only then you will be able to see Me.' And as soon as his Lord unveiled His glory to the mount, He crushed it into fine dust, and Moses fell down in a swoon. And when he recovered, he said: 'Glory be to You! To You I turn in repentance, and I am the foremost among those who believe.'",
    "He said: 'O Moses! I have indeed preferred you to all others by virtue of the Message I have entrusted to you and by virtue of My speaking to you. Hold fast therefore, to whatever I have granted you, and give thanks.'",
    "And We ordained for Moses in the Tablets all manner of admonition, and instruction concerning all things, and said to him: Hold to these, with all your strength. and bid your people to follow them in accord with their best understanding. I shall soon show you the habitation of the wicked. ",
    "I shall turn away from My signs those who, without any right, behaved haughtily in the earth, even if they may, witness each and every, sign, they shall not believe therein. And even if they see the right path, they shall still not follow it; but if they see the path of error. they shall choose it for their path. This is because they rejected Our signs as false and were heedless to them.",
    "Vain are the deeds of those who reject Our signs as false and to the meeting of the Hereafter.  Shall they be recompensed, except according to their deeds?'",
    "And in the absence of Moses his people made the image of a calf from their ornaments, which lowed. Did they not observe that it could neither speak nor give them any guidance? And still they made it an object of worship. They were indeed wrong-doing. ",
    "And when they were afflicted with remorse and realized that they had fallen into error, they said: 'If our Lord does not have mercy on us and does not pardon us, we shall be among the losers.'",
    "And when Moses returned to his people, full of wrath and sorrow, he said: 'Vile is the course you have followed in my absence. Could you not patiently wait for the decree of your Lord?' And he threw down the Tablets [of the Law] and took hold of his brother's head, dragging him to himself. Aaron said: 'My mother's son, the people overpowered me and almost killed me. So let not my enemies gloat over me, and do not number me among the wrong-doing folk.'",
    "Thereupon Moses said: 'O Lord! Grant forgiveness upon me and my brother and admit us to Your Mercy, for You are most merciful of the merciful.'",
    "In reply they were told: 'Verily those who worshipped the calf will certainly incur indignation from their Lord, and will be abased in the life of this world. Thus do We reward those who fabricate lies.",
    "As for those who do evil, and later repent and have faith, such shall find their Lord All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate after (they repent and believe)",
    "And when the anger of Moses was stilled, he took up the Tablets again, the text of which comprised guidance and mercy to those who fear their Lord.",
    "And out of his people Moses singled out seventy men for Our appointment. Then, when violent shaking seized them, he addressed his Lord: 'Had You willed, O my Lord, You could have destroyed them and me long ago. Will You destroy us for what the fools amongst us did? That was nothing but a trial from You whereby You mislead whom You will and guide whom You will.  You alone are our guardian. Forgive us, then, and have mercy upon us. You are the best of those who forgive.",
    "And ordain for us what is good in this world and in the World to Come for to You have we turned.'He replied: 'I afflict whomsoever I wish with My chastisement. As for My mercy, it encompasses everything. will show mercy to those who abstain from evil, pay Zakat and have faith in Our signs.'",
    "[To-day this mercy is for] those who follow the ummi Prophet, whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel with them. He enjoins upon them what is good and forbids them what is evil. He makes the clean things lawful to them and prohibits all corrupt things, and removes from them their burdens and the shackles that were upon them. So those who believe in him and assist him, and succour him and follow the Light which has been sent down with him, it is they who shall prosper.",
    "[Say, O Muhammad]: 'O men! I am Allah's Messenger to you all - of Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He grants life and deals death. Have faith then, in Allah and in His Messenger, the ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words; and follow him so that you may be guided aright.'",
    "Among the people of Moses' there was a party who guided others in the way of the truth and established justice in its light. ",
    "And We divided them into twelve tribes, forming them into communities. When his people asked Moses for water We directed him: 'Smite the rock with your rod.' Then twelve springs gushed forth from the rock and every people knew their drinking-places. And We caused thick clouds to provide them shade, and We sent down upon them manna and quails, saying: 'Eat of the clean things that We have provided you.' They wronged not Us, but it was themselves that they wronged.",
    "And recall when it was said to them: 'Dwell in this town and eat plentifully of whatever you please, and say: \"Repentance\", and enter the gate prostrate. We shall forgive you your sins and shall bestow further favours on those who do good.'",
    "Then the wrong-doers among them substituted another word in place of the one told them. So We sent upon them a scourge from the heaven as a punishment for their Wrong-doing. ",
    "And ask the people of Moses concerning the town situated along the sea how its people profaned the Sabbath when fish came to them breaking the water's surface on Sabbath days, and would not come to them on other than Sabbath-days. Thus did We try them because of their disobedience.",
    "And recall when a party of them said: 'Why do you admonish a people whom Allah is about to destroy or punish severely?' They said: 'We admonish them in order to be able to offer an excuse before Your Lord, and in the hope that they will guard against disobedience.'",
    "Then, when they forgot what they had been exhorted, We delivered those who forbade evil and afflicted the wrong-doers with a grievous chastisement because of their evildoing.",
    "And when they persisted in pursuing that which had been forbidden We said: 'Become despised apes.'",
    "And recall when Your Lord proclaimed that 'He would continually set in authority over them, till the Day of Judgement, those who would ruthless oppress thern.' Surely, your Lord is swift in chastising; and yet He is All-Forgiving, All-Merciful.",
    "And We dispersed them through the earth in communities - some were righteous, others were not -and We tested them with prosperity and adversity that they may turn back (to righteousness).",
    "Then others succeeded them who inherited the scriptures, and yet kept themselves occupied in acquiring the goods of this world and kept saying: 'We shall be forgiven.' And when there comes to them an opportunity for acquiring more of those goods, they seize it. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? And they have read what is in the Book and know that the abode of the Hereafter is better for the God-fearing. Do you not understand?",
    "Those who hold fast to the Book and establish Prayer - We shall not allow the reward of such righteous men to go to waste.",
    "And recall when We shook the mountain over them as though it were a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall over them; and We said: 'Hold firmly to that which We have given you, and remember what is in it, that you may guard against evil.",
    "And recall (O Prophet) when your Lord brought forth descendants from the loins of the sons of Adam, and made them witnesses against their ownselves. asking them: 'Am I not your Lord?' They said: 'Yes, we do testify.' We did so lest you claim on the Day of Resurrection: 'We were unaware of this.'",
    "Or say: 'Our forefathers before us who associated others with Allah in His divinity; we were merely their offspring who followed them. And would You destroy us for that which the unrighteous did?'",
    "And thus do We expound the signs that they may turn back (to the right path).",
    "And recite to them [O Muhammad] the story of the man to whom We gave Our signs and who turned away from them; then ultimately Satan caught up with him and he was led astray.",
    "Now had We so willed We could indeed have exalted him through those signs, but he clung to earthly life and followed his carnal desires. Thus his parable is that of the dog who lolls out his tongue whether you attack him or leave him alone. Such is the parable of those who reject Our signs as false. Narrate to them these parables that they may reflect.",
    "Evil is the example of the people who reject Our signs as false and perpetrate wrong against their own selves.",
    "He whom Allah guides, he alone is rightly guided; and he whom Allah lets go astray - it is they who are the loser.'",
    "And certainly We have created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind; they have hearts with which they fail to understand; and they have eyes with which they fail to see; and they have ears with which they fail to hear. They are like cattle - indeed, even more astray. Such are utterly heedless.",
    "Allah has the most excellent names. So call on Him by His names and shun those who distort them. They shall soon be requited for their deeds.",
    "And of those whom We have created there is a party who guide men through the truth and act justly according to it.",
    "As for those who reject Our signs as false, We shall lead them, step by step, to their ruin without their even perceiving it.",
    "And (for this purpose) I will grant them respite. My design is incontrovertible.",
    "Have they not pondered that their companion [i.e. the Prophet Muhammad] is not afflicted with insanity? He is only a plain warner.",
    "Have they not observed the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that Allah has created and that their term of life might have drawn near After this warning from the Prophet, what will it be that will make them believe?",
    "For those whom Allah lets go astray, there is no guide; and He will leave them in their transgression to stumble blindly.",
    "They ask you concerning the Hour, when will its coming be? Say: 'The knowledge of it is with my Lord alone: none but He will disclose it at its time. That will weigh heavily on the heavens and the earth; and it shall not come to you other than all of a sudden.' They ask you - as if you are eagerly inquisitive about it - concerning it. Say to them: 'The knowledge of it is with none except Allah. But most people are unaware of this reality.'",
    "Tell them [O Muhammad]: 'I have no power to benefit or harm myself except as Allah may please. And had I knowledge of the unseen, I should have amassed all kinds of good, and no evil would have ever touched me. I am merely a warner and the herald of glad tidings to those who have faith.'",
    "It is He - Allah -Who created you from a single being, and out of it He made its mate, that he may find comfort in her. And when he covers her, she bears a light burden and goes about with it. Then, when she grows heavy, they pray to their Lord: 'If You bestow upon us a healthy child, we will surely give thanks.'",
    "But when He vouchsafes them a healthy child, they attribute to Him partners regarding what Allah had bestowed upon them. Subliminally exalted is Allah above that which they associate with Him.",
    "Do they associate (with Allah in His divinity) those who can create nothing; rather, they are themselves created?",
    "They have no power to help others. nor can they help themselves.",
    "And if you call them to true guidance, they will not follow you. It is all the same for you whether you call them to true guidance or keep silent.",
    "Those whom you invoke other than Allah are creatures like you. So invoke them. and see if they answer your call, if what you claim is true.",
    "Have they feet on which they can walk? Have they hands with which they can grasp? Have they eyes with which they can see? Have they ears with which they can hear? Say [O Muhammad]: 'Invoke all those to whom you ascribe a share in Allah's divinity, then scheme against me and grant me no respite.",
    "My guardian is Allah Who has revealed the Book, and it is He Who protects the righteous.",
    "And those whom you invoke other than Allah, they can neither help themselves nor you.",
    "And if you were to call them to true guidance, they will not hear; and you observe them looking at you whereas they have no power to see.'",
    "[O Prophet!] Show forgiveness, enjoin equity, and avoid the ignorant.",
    "And if it happens that a prompting from Satan should stir you up, seek refuge with Allah. He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "If the God-fearing are instigated by any suggestion of Satan, they instantly become alert, whereafter they clearly perceive the right way.",
    "As for their brethren [the Satans], they draw them deeper into error and do not relax in their efforts.",
    "[O Prophet!] When you do not produce before them any miracle, they say: 'Why do you not choose for yourself a miracle?' Say to them: 'I follow only what is revealed to me by my Lord. This is nothing but a means of insight into the truth, and guidance and mercy from your Lord to the people who believe.",
    "So when the Qur'an is recited, listen carefully to it, and keep silent so that you may, be shown mercy.'",
    "And remember [O Prophet] your Lord in your mind, with humility and fear, and without raising your voice; remember Him in the morning and evening, and do not become of those who are negligent.",
    "[The angels] who are near to Your Lord, never turn away from His service out of arrogance; they rather glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him.",
    "They ask you concerning the spoils of war? Tell them: 'The spoils of war belong to Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah, and set things right between you, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are true believers. ",
    "The true believers are those who, when Allah's name is mentioned, their hearts quake, and when His verses are recited to them their faith grows, and who put their trust in their Lord;",
    "who establish Prayer and spend out of what We have provided them.",
    "Such people are indeed true believers. They have high ranks with their Lord, and forgiveness for their sins and an honourable sustenance.",
    "(Now with regard to the spoils the same situation exists as when) your Lord brought you forth from your home in a righteous cause while a party among the believers were much averse to it.",
    "They disputed with you about the truth after that had become evident, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open.",
    "And recall when Allah promised you that one of the two hosts would fall to you, and you wished that the one without arms should fall into your hands. But Allah sought to prove by His words the truth to be true and to annihilate the unbelievers to the last remnant",
    "that He might prove the truth to be true and the false to be false, however averse the evil-doers might be to it.",
    "And recall when you implored your Lord for help and He responded to you: 'I will indeed reinforce you with a thousand angels, coming host after host.'",
    "Allah meant this as glad tidings and that your hearts may be set at rest. For every help comes from Allah alone. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
    "And recall when Allah brought on you drowsiness, giving you a feeling of peace and security from Him, and He sent down rain upon you from the sky that He might cleanse you through it and take away from you the pollution of Satan and strengthen your hearts, and steady your feet through it.",
    "And recall when your Lord inspired the angels: 'I am certainly with you. So make firm the feet of those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike at their necks and strike at every pore and tip.",
    "This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. Whoever defies Allah and His Messenger must know that Allah is severe in punishment.",
    "That is your punishment (from Allah). So taste this punishment, and know that for the unbelievers is the punishment of the Fire.",
    "Believers, whenever you encounter a hostile force of unbelievers, do not turn your backs to them in flight.",
    "For he who turns his back on them on such ar occasion - except that it be for tactical reasons, or turning to join another company - he shall incur the wrath of Allah and Hell shall be his abode. It is an evil destination.",
    "So the fact is that it was not you, but it was Allah Who killed them; and it was not you when you threw [sand at them], but it was Allah Who threw it, (and the believers were employed for the task) that He might cause the believers to successfully pass through this test. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "This is His manner of dealing with you. As for the unbelievers, Allah will surely undermine their designs.",
    "(Tell the unbelievers:) 'If you have sought a judgement, then surely a judgement has come to you.  And if you desist from disobedience, it is all the better for you. But if you revert to your mischief, We will again chastise you; and your host, howsoever numerous, will never be of any avail to you. Know well, Allah is with the believers.'",
    "Believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him after you hear his command.",
    "And do not be like those who say: 'We hear', though they do not hearken.",
    "Indeed the worst kind of all beasts in the sight of Allah are the people that are deaf and dumb, and do not understand.",
    "And had Allah known in them any good He would surely, have made them hear; but (being as they, are) even if He made them hear, they would have surely turned away in aversion.",
    "Believers! Respond to Allah, and respond to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. Know well that Allah stands between a man and his heart, and it is to Him that all of you shall be mustered.",
    "And guard against the mischief that will not only bring punishment to the wrong-doers among you. Know well that Allah is severe in punishment.",
    "And recall when you were few in numbers and deemed weak in the land, fearful lest people do away with you. Then He provided you refuge, strengthened you with His help, and provided you sustenance with good things that you may be grateful.",
    "Believers! Do not be unfaithful to Allah and the Messenger, nor be knowingly unfaithful to your trusts.",
    "Know well that your belongings and your children are but a trial, and that with Allah there is a mighty reward.",
    "Believers! If you fear Allah He will grant you a criterion and will cleanse you of your sins and forgive you. Allah is Lord of abounding bounty.",
    "And recall how those who disbelieved schemed against you to take you captive, or kill you, or drive you away. They schemed and Allah did also scheme. Allah is the best of those who scheme.",
    "And when Our verses are recited to them, they say: 'We have heard. We could, if we willed, compose the like of it. They, are nothing but fables of the ancient times.'",
    "And also recall when they said: 'O Allah! If this indeed be the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from heaven, or bring upon us a painful chastisement.'",
    "But Allah was not to chastise them while you are in their midst; nor was Allah going to chastise them while they sought His forgiveness. ",
    "But what prevents Allah from chastising them now when they are hindering people from the Holy Mosque, even though they are not even its true guardians. For its true guardians are none but the God-fearing, though most of them do not know that.",
    "Their Prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and handclapping. Taste, then, this chastisement for your denying the truth.",
    "Surely those who deny the truth spend their wealth to hinder people from the way of Allah, and will continue to so spend until their efforts become a source of intense regret for them, and then they will be vanquished, and then these deniers of the truth will be driven to Hell,",
    "so that Allah may separate the bad from the good, and join together all those who are bad into a pile one upon another, and cast them into Hell. They, it is they who are the losers.",
    "[O Prophet!] Tell the unbelievers that if they desist from evil, their past shall be forgiven and if they revert to their past ways, then it is well known what happened with the people of the past.",
    "And fight against them until the mischief ends and the way prescribed by Allah - the whole of it -prevail Then, if they give up mischief, surely Allah sees what they do.",
    "But if they turn away, then know well that Allah is your Protector - an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper."
