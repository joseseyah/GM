    "He said: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me?\"",
    "Moses said: \"Keep me no more in your company if I question you concerning anything after this. You will then be fully justified.\"",
    "Then the two went forth until when they came to a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to play host to them. They found in that town a wall that was on the verge of tumbling down, and he buttressed it, whereupon Moses said: \"If you had wished, you could have received payment for it.\"",
    "He said: \"This brings me and you to a parting of ways. Now I shall explain to you the true meaning of things about which you could not remain patient.",
    "As for the boat it belonged to some poor people who worked on the river, and I desired to damage it for beyond them lay the dominion of a king who was wont to seize every boat by force.",
    "As for the lad, his parents were people of faith, and we feared lest he should plague them with transgression and disbelief,",
    "and we desired that their Lord should grant them another in his place, a son more upright and more tender hearted.",
    "As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under it there was a treasure that belonged to them. Their father was a righteous man and your Lord intended that they should come of age and then bring forth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord; I did not do this of my own bidding. This is the true meaning of things with which you could not keep your patience.\"",
    "(O Muhammad), they ask you about Dhu al-Qarnayn. Say: \"I will give you an account of him.\"",
    "We granted him power in the land and endowed him with all kinds of resources.",
    "He set out (westwards) on an expedition,",
    "until when he reached the very limits where the sun sets, he saw it setting in dark turbid waters; and nearby he met a people. We said: \"O Dhu al-Qarnayn, you have the power to punish or to treat them with kindness.\"",
    "He said: \"We will chastise him who does wrong, whereafter he will be returned to his Lord and He will chastise him grievously.",
    "But as for him who believes and acts righteously, his will be a goodly reward and we shall enjoin upon him only mild commands.\"",
    "Then he set out on another expedition",
    "until he reached the limit where the sun rises and he found it rising on a people whom We had provided no shelter from it.",
    "Thus was the state of those people, and We encompassed in knowledge all concerning Dhu al- Qarnayn.",
    "Then he set out on another expedition",
    "until when he reached a place between the two mountains, he found beside the mountains a people who scarcely understood anything.",
    "They said: \"O Dhu al-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are spreading corruption in this land. So shall we pay you taxes on the understanding that you will set up a barrier between us and them?\"",
    "He answered: \"Whatever my Lord has granted me is good enough. But help me with your labour and I will erect a rampart between you and them.",
    "Bring me ingots of iron.\" Then after he had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said: \"(Light a fire) and ply bellows.\" When he had made it (red like) fire, he said: \"Bring me molten copper which I may pour on it.\"",
    "Such was the rampart that Gog and Magog could not scale, nor could they pierce it.",
    "Dhu al-Qarnayn said: \"This is a mercy from my Lord: but when the time of my Lord's promise shall come, He will level the rampart with the ground. My Lord's promise always comes true.\"",
    "And on that Day We shall let some of them surge like waves against others, and the Trumpet shall be blown. Then We shall gather them all together.",
    "That will be the Day We shall place Hell before the unbelievers",
    "whose eyes had become blind against My admonition and who were utterly disinclined to hear it.",
    "Do the unbelievers, then, believe that they can take any of My creatures as their guardians beside Me? Verily We have prepared Hell to welcome the unbelievers.",
    "Say, (O Muhammad): \"Shall We tell you who will be the greatest losers in respect of their works?",
    "It will be those whose effort went astray in the life of the world and who believe nevertheless that they are doing good.",
    "Those are the ones who refused to believe in the revelations of their Lord and that they are bound to meet Him. Hence, all their deeds have come to naught, and We shall assign no weight to them on the Day of Resurrection.",
    "Hell is their recompense for disbelieving and their taking My revelations and My Messengers as objects of jest.",
    "As for those who believe and do good works, the Gardens of Paradise shall be there to welcome them;",
    "there they will abide for ever, with no desire to be removed from there.\"",
    "Say: \"If the sea were to become ink to record the Words of my Lord, indeed the sea would be all used up before the Words of my Lord are exhausted, and it would be the same even if We were to bring an equal amount of ink.\"",
    "Say (O Muhammad): \"I am no more than a human being like you; one to whom revelation is made: 'Your Lord is the One and Only God.' Hence, whoever looks forward to meet his Lord, let him do righteous works, and let him associate none with the worship of his Lord.\"",

    "This is an account of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah",

    "(He was told): \"Zechariah, We bring you the good news of the birth of a son whose name shall be Yahya (John), one whose namesake We never created before.\"",
    "He said: \"My Lord! How can I have a boy when my wife is barren and I have reached an extremely old age?\"",
    "He answered: \"So shall it be.\" Your Lord says: \"It is easy for Me,\" and then added: \"For beyond doubt, I created you earlier when you were nothing.\"",
    "Zechariah said: \"Lord, grant me a Sign.\" Said He: \"Your Sign is that you shall not be able to speak to people for three nights, though you will be otherwise sound.\"",
    "Thereupon Zechariah came out from the sanctuary and directed his people by gestures to extol His glory by day and by night.",
    "\"O John! Hold the Book with all your strength.\" We had bestowed wisdom upon him while he was still a child;",
    "and We also endowed him with tenderness and purity, and he was exceedingly pious",
    "and cherishing to his parents. Never was he insolent or rebellious.",
    "Peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he will die, and the day he will be raised up alive.",
    "(O Muhammad), recite in the Book the account of Mary, when she withdrew from her people to a place towards the east;",
    "and drew a curtain, screening herself from people whereupon We sent to her Our spirit and he appeared to her as a well-shaped man.",
    "Mary exclaimed: \"I surely take refuge from you with the Most Compassionate Lord, if you are at all God-fearing.\"",
    "He said: \"I am just a message-bearer of your Lord, I have come to grant you a most pure boy.\"",
    "Mary said: \"How can a boy be born to me when no man has even touched me, nor have I ever been unchaste?\"",
    "The angel said: \"Thus shall it be. Your Lord says: 'It is easy for Me; and We shall do so in order to make him a Sign for mankind and a mercy from Us. This has been decreed.' \"",
    "Then she conceived him and withdrew with him to a far-off place.",
    "Then the birth pangs drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree and she said: \"Oh, would that I had died before this and had been all forgotten.\"",
    "Thereupon the angel below her cried out: \"Grieve not, for your Lord has caused a stream of water to flow beneath you.",
    "Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards yourself and fresh and ripe dates shall fall upon you.",
    "So eat and drink and cool your eyes; and if you see any person say to him: 'Verily I have vowed a fast to the Most Compassionate Lord, and so I shall not speak to anyone today.' \"",
    "Then she came to her people, carrying her baby. They said: \"O Mary! You have committed a monstrous thing.",
    "O sister of Aaron! Your father was not an evil man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman.\"",
    "Thereupon Mary pointed to the child. They exclaimed: \"How can we speak to one who is in the cradle, a mere child?\"",
    "The child cried out: \"Verily I am Allah's servant. He has granted me the Book and has made me a Prophet",
    "and has blessed me wherever I might be and has enjoined upon me Prayer and Zakah (purifying alms) as long as I live;",
    "and has made me dutiful to my mother. He has not made me oppressive, nor bereft of God's blessings.",
    "Peace be upon me the day I was born and the day I will die, and the day I will be raised up alive.\"",
    "This is Jesus, the son of Mary; and this is the truth about him concerning which they are in doubt.",
    "It does not befit Allah to take for Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a thing He only says: \"Be\" and it is.",
    "(Jesus had said): \"Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him alone. This is the Straight Way.\"",
    "But different parties began to dispute with one another. A dreadful woe awaits on that great Day for those that reject the Truth.",
    "How well shall they hear and how well shall they see on the Day they come to Us! But today the evil-doers are in manifest error.",
    "(O Muhammad), warn those who are steeped in heedlessness and are obstinately rejecting the truth that the Day shall come when things will be finally decided and they shall be left with utter remorse.",
    "Ultimately, We shall inherit the earth and whatever is on it; to Us shall they be returned.",
    "(O Muhammad), recite in the Book the account of Abraham. Most surely he was a man of truth, a Prophet.",
    "(And remind people) when he said to his father: \"Father! Why do you worship that which neither sees nor hears, and which can be of no avail to you?",
    "Father, a knowledge that has not reached you has come to me. So follow me that I may guide you to a Straight Way.",
    "Father, do not serve Satan, for Satan has indeed been a persistent rebel against the Most Compassionate Lord.",
    "Father, I fear that a punishment from the Most Compassionate Lord might strike you and you may end up as one of Satan's companions?\"",
    "The father said: \"Abraham, have you turned away from my gods? If you do not give this up, I shall stone you to death. Now begone from me forever.\"",
    "Abraham answered: \"Peace be upon you. I shall seek pardon for you from my Lord. My Lord has always been kind to Me.",
    "I shall withdraw from you and all that you call upon beside Allah. I shall only call upon my Lord. I trust the prayer to my Lord will not go unanswered.\"",
    "Thereupon Abraham dissociated himself from his people and the deities they worshipped instead of Allah, and We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob and made each of them a Prophet;",
    "and We bestowed on them Our mercy, and granted them a truly lofty renown.",
    "And recite in the Book the account of Moses. He was a chosen one, a Messenger, a Prophet.",
    "We called out to him from the right side of the Mount, and We drew him near to Us by communing to him in secret,",
    "and out of Our mercy We appointed his brother Aaron, a Prophet (that he may assist him).",
    "And recite in the Book the account of Ishmael. He was ever true to his promise, and was a Messenger, a Prophet.",
    "He enjoined his household to observe Prayer and to give Zakah (purifying alms); and his Lord was well pleased with him.",
    "And recite in the Book the account of Idris. He was a man of truth, a Prophet;",
    "and We exalted him to a lofty position.",
    "These are the Prophets upon whom Allah bestowed His favour from the seed of Adam, and from the seed of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and from the seed of Abraham and Israel. They were those whom We guided and chose (for an exalted position). They were such that when the words of the Most Compassionate Lord were recited to them, they fell down in prostration, weeping.",
    "They were succeeded by a people who neglected the Prayers and pursued their lusts. They shall presently meet with their doom,",
    "except those who repent and believe and act righteously. Such shall enter Paradise and shall not be wronged at all.",
    "Theirs shall be everlasting Gardens which the Most Compassionate Lord has promised His servants in a realm which is beyond the ken of perception. Surely His promise shall he fulfilled.",
    "They shall not hear in it anything vain; they shall hear only what is good; and they shall have their provision in it, morning and evening.",
    "Such is the Paradise which We shall cause those of Our servants who have been God-fearing to inherit.",

    "He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is in between. Serve Him, then, and be constant in serving Him. Do you know anyone that might be His compeer?\"",
    "Man is prone to say: \"Shall I be raised to life after I die?\"",
    "Does man not remember that We created him before when he was nothing?",
    "By your Lord, We will surely muster them and the devils together. Then We will surely bring them all, on their knees, around Hell,",
    "and then We will draw aside from each party those who were most rebellious against the Most Compassionate Lord,",
    "and then We shall know well all those most worthy to be cast in Hell.",
    "There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.",
    "Then We shall deliver those that feared Allah and leave the wrong-doers there on their knees.",
    "When Our clear revelations are recited to those who deny the Truth they are wont to say to those who have faith: \"Which of the two groups has a better status and whose assemblies are grander?\"",
    "How numerous are the peoples We destroyed before them - those that were more resourceful and grander in outward appearance!",
    "Say: \"The Most Compassionate Lord grants respite to those who stray into error, until they behold what they had been threatened with, either God's chastisement (in the world) or the Hour (of Resurrection)\" - then they fully know whose station is worse, and who is weaker in hosts!",
    "(On the contrary), Allah increases in guidance those who follow the Right Way. Lasting acts of righteousness are better in the sight of your Lord as reward and conducive to a better end.",
    "Have you seen him who rejected Our signs and said: \"Surely I shall continue to be favoured with riches and children.\"",
    "Has he obtained knowledge of the Unseen, or has he taken a covenant with the Most Compassionate Lord?",
    "By no means! We shall write down all what he says; and We shall greatly prolong his chastisement,",
    "and We shall inherit all the resources and hosts of which he boasts, and he will come to Us all alone.",
    "They have taken other gods instead of Allah that they may be a source of strength for them.",

    "Do you not see that We have sent devils upon the unbelievers who greatly incite them (to oppose the Truth)?",
    "Therefore, do not hasten (in seeking a scourge against them). We are counting their days.",
    "The Day shall soon come when We shall bring together the God-fearing to the Most Compassionate Lord, as honoured guests;",

    "On that Day none will have the power to intercede for them except those who received a sanction from the Most Compassionate Lord.",
    "They claim: \"The Most Compassionate Lord has taken a son to Himself.\"",
    "Surely you have made a monstrous statement.",
    "It is such a monstrosity that heavens might well-nigh burst forth at it, the earth might be cleaved, and the mountains fall",
    "at their ascribing a son to the Most Compassionate Lord.",
    "It does not befit the Most Compassionate Lord that He should take a son.",
    "There is no one in the heavens and the earth but he shall come to the Most Compassionate Lord as His servant.",
    "Verily He encompasses them and has counted them all.",
    "On the Day of Resurrection each one of these will come to Him singly.",

    "To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and all that is in between, and all that is beneath the soil.",
    "Whether you speak out aloud (or in a low voice), He knows what is said secretly, and even that which is most hidden.",
    "Allah - there is no god but He. His are the most excellent names.",
    "Has the story of Moses reached you?",
    "When he saw a fire and said to his family: \"Hold on! I have just perceived a fire; perhaps I will bring a brand from it for you, or I will find some guidance at the fire about the way to follow.\"",
    "When he came to it, a voice called out: \"Moses!",
    "Verily I am your Lord! Take off your shoes. You are in the sacred valley, Tuwa!",
    "I Myself have chosen you; therefore, give ear to what is revealed.",
    "Verily I am Allah. There is no god beside Me. So serve Me and establish Prayers to remember Me.",
    "The Hour of Resurrection is coming. I have willed to keep the time of its coming hidden so that everyone may be recompensed in accordance with his effort.",
    "Let him who does not believe in it and follows his lust not turn your thought away from it, lest you are ruined.",
    "And what is in your right hand, O Moses?\"",
    "Moses answered: \"This is my staff. I lean on it (when I walk), and with it I beat down leaves for my flock, and I have many other uses for it.\"",
    "He said: \"Moses, throw it down.\"",
    "So he threw it down, and lo! it was a rapidly moving snake.",
    "Then He said: \"Seize it and have no fear. We shall restore it to its former state.",
    "And place your hand in your armpit, it will come forth shining white, without blemish. This is another Sign of Allah,",
    "for We shall show you some of Our greatest Signs.",
    "And go to Pharaoh now for he has transgressed all bounds.\"",
    "Moses said: \"Lord! Open my breast for me;",
    "and ease my task for me,",
    "and loosen the knot from my tongue",
    "so that they may understand my speech;",
    "and appoint for me, from my household, someone who will help me bear my burden -",
    "Aaron, my brother.",
    "Strengthen me through him",
    "and let him share my task",
    "that we may abundantly extol Your glory;",
    "and may remember You much.",
    "Verily, You have always watched over us.\"",
    "He said: \"Moses, your petition is granted.",
    "We have again bestowed Our favour upon you.",
    "Recall, when We indicated to your mother through inspiration:",
    "'Put the baby into a chest and then throw him in the river. The river will throw him up on the shore, and then an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will take him.' And I spread My love over you in order that you might be reared in My sight.",
    "Recall, when your sister went along, saying: 'Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him?' Thus We brought you back to your mother so that her heart might be gladdened and she might not grieve. Moses, recall when you slew a person. We delivered you from distress and made you go through several trials. Then you stayed for several years among the people of Midian, and now you have come at the right moment as ordained.",
    "I have chosen you for My service.",
    "So go forth, both you and your brother, with My Signs, and do not slacken in remembering Me.",
    "Go both of you to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed all bounds,",
    "and speak to him gently, perhaps he may take heed or fear (Allah).\"",
    "The two said:\" Lord! We fear he may commit excesses against us, or transgress all bounds.\"",
    "He said: \"Have no fear. I am with you, hearing and seeing all.",
    "So, go to him, and say: 'Behold, both of us are the Messengers of your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not chastise them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; and peace shall be for him who follows the true guidance.",
    "It has been revealed to us that chastisement awaits those who called the lie to the truth and turned away from it.' \"",
    "Pharaoh said:\" Moses! Who is the Lord of the two of you?\"",
    "He said: \"Our Lord is He Who gave everything its form and then guided it.\"",
    "Pharaoh asked: \"Then, what is the state of the former generations?\"",
    "Moses said: \"Its knowledge is with my Lord, recorded in the Book. My Lord does not err, nor does He forget.\"",
    "He it is Who spread the earth for you; and made in it paths for you, and sent down water from the sky, and then through it We brought forth many species of diverse plants.",
    "So eat yourself and pasture your cattle. Surely there are many Signs in this for people of understanding.",
    "From this very earth We created you and to the same earth We shall cause you to return, and from it We shall bring you forth to life again.",
    "Indeed We showed Pharaoh Our Signs, all of them, but he declared them to be false and rejected them.",
    "He said: \"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land by your sorcery?",
    "We shall confront you with a sorcery like your own. So appoint a day when both of us might meet face to face in an open space; an appointment which neither we nor you shall fail to keep.\"",
    "Moses said: \"The appointment to meet you is on the Day of the Feast and let all people come together before noon.\"",
    "Pharaoh went back and concerted all his stratagem and returned for the encounter.",
    "(At the time of the encounter) Moses said to them: \"Woe to you! Do not invent falsehoods against Allah lest He destroy you with a scourge. Surely those who invent lies shall come to grief.\"",
    "Thereupon they wrangled among themselves about the matter and conferred in secret.",
    "Some of them said: \"These two are magicians, who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and to destroy your excellent way of life.",
    "So muster all your stratagem and come forth in a row. Whoever prevails today shall triumph.\"",
    "The magicians said: \"Moses, will you throw down or shall we be the first to throw?\"",
    "Moses replied: \"No, let it be you to throw first.\" Then suddenly it appeared to Moses, owing to their magic, as if their ropes and staffs were running.",
    "So Moses' heart was filled with fear.",
    "We said to him: \"Have no fear; for it is you who will prevail.",
    "And throw down what is in your right hand; it will swallow up all that they have wrought. They have wrought only a magician's stratagem. A magician cannot come to any good, come whence he may.\"",
    "Eventually the magicians were impelled to fall down prostrate and said: \"We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"What! Did you believe in Him even before I permitted you to do so? Surely, he must be your chief who taught you magic. Now I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and will crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and then you will come to know which of us can inflict sterner and more lasting torment.\"",
    "The magicians answered: \"By Him Who has created us, we shall never prefer you to the Truth after manifest Signs have come to us. So decree whatever you will. Your decree will pertain, at the most, to the present life of the world.",
    "We believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and also forgive us the practice of magic to which you had compelled us. Allah is the Best and He alone will abide.\"",
    "The truth is that Hell awaits him who comes to his Lord laden with sin; he shall neither die in it nor live.",
    "But he who comes to Him with faith and righteous works shall be exalted to high ranks,",
    "and shall live for ever in everlasting Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves.",
    "Most certainly We revealed to Moses: \"Proceed with My servants in the night and strike for them a dry path in the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be afraid of treading through the sea.\"",
    "Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts, but they were fully overwhelmed by the sea.",
    "Pharaoh led his people astray; he did not guide them aright.",
    "Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount and sent down on you manna and quails,",
    "saying: \"Partake of the good things that We have provided for you, but do not transgress lest My wrath fall upon you; for he upon whom My wrath falls is ruined.",
    "But I am indeed Most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does righteous works and keeps to the Right Way.\"",
    "\"But, O Moses, what has made you come in haste from your people?\"",
    "He said: \"They are close behind me, and I hastened to You, Lord, that You may be pleased with me.\"",
    "Said He: \"Verily We tested your people in your absence and the Samiri led them astray.\"",
    "Moses returned to his people full of wrath and grief, and said: \"My people! Has your Lord not made good an excellent promise He made to you? And has a long time passed since those promises were fulfilled? Or was it to incur the wrath of your Lord that you broke your promise with me?\"",
    "They answered: \"We did not break our promise with you out of our own volition; but we were laden with the load of people's ornaments, and we simply threw them down(into the fire), and the Samiri also threw down something,",
    "and brought out of there (from the molten gold) the effigy of a calf that lowed.\" The people cried out: \"This is your deity and the deity of Moses, whom Moses has forgotten.\"",
    "Did they not see that it did not return a word to them, and had no power either to hurt them or to cause them any benefit?",
    "Certainly Aaron had said to them even before (the return of Moses): \"My people, you were fallen into error because of the calf. Surely your Lord is Most Compassionate; so follow me and obey my command.\"",
    "But they answered: \"By no means shall we cease to worship it until Moses returns to us.\"",
    "(After rebuking his people) Moses turned to Aaron and said: \"Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray,",
    "from following my way? Have you disobeyed my command?\"",
    "Aaron answered: \"Son of my mother! Do not seize me with my beard, nor by (the hair of) my head. I feared that on returning you might say: 'You sowed discord among the Children of Israel, and did not pay heed to my words.'\"",
    "Moses said: \"What, then, is your case, O Samiri?\"",
    "He answered: \"I saw what the people did not see. So I took a handful of dust from the trail of the Messenger, and I flung it (into the fire). Thus did my mind prompt me.\"",
    "Moses said: \"Be gone, then. All your life you shall cry: 'Untouchable.' There awaits a term for your reckoning that you cannot fail to keep. Now look at your god that you devotedly adored: We shall burn it and scatter its remains in the sea.",
    "Your God is none else than Allah, beside Whom there is no god. His knowledge embraces everything.\"",
    "(O Muhammad), thus do We recount to you the events of the past, and We have bestowed upon you from Ourself an admonition.",
    "He who turns away from it will surely bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection,",
    "and will abide under this burden for ever. Grievous shall be the burden on the Day of Resurrection,",
    "the Day when the Trumpet shall be sounded and We shall muster the sinners, their eyes turned blue with terror.",
    "They shall whisper among themselves: \"You stayed on the earth barely ten days.\"",
    "We know well what they will say to one another: We also know that even the most cautious in his estimate will say: \"You lived in the world no more than a day.\"",
    "They ask you concerning the mountains: \"Where will they go?\" Say: \"My Lord will scatter them like dust,",
    "and leave the earth a levelled plain",
    "in which you shall find no crookedness or curvature.",
    "On that Day people shall follow straight on to the call of the summoner, no one daring to show any haughtiness. Their voices shall be hushed before the Most Compassionate Lord, so that you will hear nothing but a whispering murmur.",
    "On that Day intercession shall not avail save of him whom the Most Compassionate Lord permits, and whose word of intercession is pleasing to Him.",
    "He knows all that is ahead of them and all that is behind them, while the others do not know.",
    "All faces shall be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting Lord, and he who bears the burden of iniquity will have failed;",
    "but whosoever does righteous works, being a believer, shall have no fear of suffering wrong or loss.\"",
    "(O Muhammad), thus have We revealed this as an Arabic Qur'an and have expounded in it warning in diverse ways so that they may avoid evil or become heedful.",
    "Exalted is Allah, the True King! Hasten not with reciting the Qur'an before its revelation to you is finished, and pray: \"Lord! Increase me in knowledge.\"",
    "Most certainly We had given Adam a command before, but he forgot. We found him lacking in firmness of resolution.",
    "Recall when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam\"; all prostrated themselves save Iblis. He refused.",
    "Then We said: \"Adam! He is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not drive both of you out of Paradise and plunge you into affliction,",
    "(for in Paradise) neither are you hungry nor naked,",
    "nor face thirst or scorching heat.\"",
    "But Satan seduced him, saying: \"Adam! Shall I direct you to a tree of eternal life and an abiding kingdom?\"",
    "Then the two of them ate the fruit of that tree and their shameful parts became revealed to each other, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves from the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and strayed into error.",
    "Thereafter his Lord exalted him, accepted his repentance, and bestowed guidance upon him,",
    "and said: \"Get down, both of you, (that is, man and Satan), and be out of it; each of you shall be an enemy to the other. Henceforth if there comes to you a guidance from Me, then whosoever follows My guidance shall neither go astray nor suffer misery.",
    "But whosoever turns away from this Admonition from Me shall have a straitened life; We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection,\"",
    "where-upon he will say: \"Lord! Why have You raised me blind when I had sight in the world?\"",
    "He will say: \"Even so it is. Our Signs came to you and you ignored them. So shall you be ignored this Day.\"",
    "Thus do We requite him who transgresses and does not believe in the signs of your Lord (during the life of the world); and surely the punishment of the Hereafter is even more terrible and more enduring.",
    "Did they not find any guidance in the fact that We destroyed many nations in whose ruined dwelling-places they now walk about? Surely there are many Signs in them for people endowed with wisdom.",
    "Were it not for a word already gone from your Lord, the decree (of their destruction) would have come to pass.",
    "So bear patiently with what they say. Glorify your Lord, praising Him before sunrise and before sunset, and in the watches of the night, and glorify Him and at the ends of the day that you may attain to happiness.",
    "Do not turn your eyes covetously towards the embellishments of worldly life that We have bestowed upon various kinds of people to test them. But the clean provision bestowed upon you by your Lord is better and more enduring.",
    "Enjoin Prayer on your household, and do keep observing it. We do not ask you for any worldly provision; rather, it is We Who provide you, and ultimately the pious will end up the best.",
    "They ask: \"Why does he not bring us a (miraculous) sign from his Lord?\" Has there not come to them a Book containing the teachings of the previous scriptures?",
    "Had We destroyed them through some calamity before his coming, they would have said: \"Our Lord! Why did You not send any Messenger to us that we might have followed Your signs before being humbled and disgraced?\"",
    "Tell them, (O Muhammad): \"Everyone is waiting for his end. Wait, then, and you will soon know who are the people of the Right Way, and are rightly-guided.\""
