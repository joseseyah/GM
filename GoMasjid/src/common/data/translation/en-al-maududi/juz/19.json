    "Those who do not look forward to meet Us say: \"Why should angels not be sent to us, or why do we ourselves not observe our Lord?\" Surely they are too proud of themselves and have gone beyond all limits in their rebellion.",
    "On that Day - the Day when they will behold angels - there will be no good news for those immersed in evil, and they will cry out: \"We seek refuge (in Allah).\"",
    "And We shall turn to their deeds and shall reduce them to scattered dust.",
    "On that Day it is the inmates of Paradise that will be graced with a better abode and a fairer resting place.",
    "On that Day the sky shall be rent asunder by a cloud and a whole cavalcade of angels will be made to descend.",
    "On that Day the true kingdom will belong only to the Merciful Lord. That will be a hard day for those that deny the Truth;",
    "a Day when the wrong-doer will bite his hands, saying: \"Would that I had stood by the Messenger!",
    "Woe is me! Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend!",
    "He led me astray from the Admonition that had come to me. Satan proved to be a great betrayer of man.\"",
    "And the Messenger will say: \"My Lord! My own people had made this Qur'an an object of laughter.\"",
    "(O Muhammad), thus did We make for every Prophet enemies from among those immersed in evil. Your Lord suffices you as a Guide and a Helper.",
    "Those who disbelieve say: \"Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?\" It was revealed thus that We may fully impress it on your mind; (and for the same end) We have revealed it gradually (according to a scheme) in fragments.",
    "(This was also done so that) whenever they put any strange question to you, We sent its right answer and explained the matter in the best manner.",
    "Those who shall be mustered in the Hell upon their faces, their stand is the worst and their way most erroneous.",
    "Verily We granted Moses the Book and appointed his brother Aaron with him as his helper",
    "and said to him: \"Go the two of you to the people who have given the lie to Our Signs.\" Thereafter We utterly destroyed them.",
    "(The same happened with) the people of Noah: when they gave the lie to the Messengers We drowned them and made of them a Sign of warning for all mankind. We have kept ready a painful chastisement for the wrong-doers.",
    "And in like manner were the 'Ad and the Thamud destroyed and the people of al-Rass and many a nation in the centuries in between.",
    "We warned each (of them) by examples (of the nations so destroyed in the past), and We totally annihilated each of them.",
    "They have surely passed by the town which was rained upon by an evil rain. Have they not seen it? Nay; but they do not believe in being raised up after death.",
    "Whenever they see you they take you for nothing else but an object of jest, saying: \"Is this whom Allah has sent as a Messenger?",
    "Had we not firmly persevered in our devotion to them (he had almost) led us astray from our gods.\" But soon, when they see the chastisement, they will come to know who had strayed too far from the Right Way.",
    "Have you ever considered the case of him who has taken his carnal desire for his god? Can you take responsibility for guiding him to the Right Way?",
    "Do you think that most of them hear or understand? For they are merely like cattle; nay, even worse than them.",
    "Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shade? If He will, He could have made it stationary; instead, We have made the sun its pilot.",
    "So (as the sun rises), We gradually roll up that shade unto Us.",
    "It is Allah Who has made night a garment for you, and sleep the repose (of death), and has made day the time of rising to life.",
    "And He it is Who sends forth the winds as glad tidings, heralding His Mercy. Then We send down pure water from the sky",
    "that We may revive through it a dead land and give it for drink to many cattle and human beings from among Our creation.",
    "We present this wondrous phenomenon to them over and over again that they may learn a lesson from it. But most people simply decline everything except disbelief and ingratitude.",
    "Had We so willed, We would have raised up in every town a warner.",
    "So, (O Prophet), do not follow the unbelievers but engage in a mighty striving against them with this Qur'an.",
    "And He it is Who has joined the two seas: one sweet and palatable and the other saltish and bitter; and He has set a barrier and an insurmountable obstruction between the two that keeps them apart.",
    "And He it is Who has created man from water and then produced from him two sorts of kindred: by descent and by marriage. Your Lord is All-Powerful.",
    "And yet people worship deities other than Allah that can neither benefit them nor hurt them. Besides, the unbeliever is ever prone to come to the support of everyone who rebels against his Lord.",
    "We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a bearer of good tidings and a warner.",
    "Say to them: \"I ask of you no reward for my work. My only reward is that whoever so wills may follow the way leading to His Lord.\"a",
    "(O Muhammad), put your trust in Him Who is Ever-Living, Who will never die, and glorify Him with His praise. He suffices as the Knower of the sins of His servants,",
    "He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is in between them in six days, and then ascended the Throne; the Merciful One. Ask concerning Him the one who knows.",
    "When they are told: \"Prostrate yourselves before the Merciful One,\" they say: \"What is the Merciful One? Shall we prostrate ourselves before whomsoever you command us to prostrate?\" This even further increases their aversion.",
    "Most blessed is He Who set a constellation in the heavens, and placed in it a great lamp and a shining moon.",
    "He it is Who has appointed night and day to succeed one another (as a Sign) for him who desires to take heed, or desires to be thankful.",
    "The true servants of the Merciful One are those who walk on the earth gently and when the foolish ones address them, they simply say: \"Peace to you\";",
    "who spend the night prostrating themselves before their Lord and standing;",
    "who entreat: \"Our Lord! Ward off from us the chastisement of Hell, for its chastisement is one that clings.",
    "Verily it is a wretched abode and restingplace.\"",
    "(The true servants of the Merciful One are) those who are neither extravagant nor niggardly in their spending but keep the golden mean between the two;",
    "who invoke no other deity along with Allah, nor take any life - which Allah has forbidden - save justly; who do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse - and whoso does that shall meet its penalty;",
    "his torment shall be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide in it in ignominy -",
    "unless he repents and believes and does righteous works. For such, Allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds. Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Compassionate.",
    "Whosoever repents and does good, he returns to Allah in the manner that he should.",
    "(The true servants of the Merciful One) are those who do not bear witness to any falsehood and who, when they pass by frivolity, pass by it with dignity;",
    "who, when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, do not fall at them deaf and blind;",
    "who are prone to pray: \"Our Lord! Grant us that our spouses and our offspring be a joy to our eyes, and do make us the leaders of the God-fearing.\"",
    "They are the ones who will be rewarded for their patience: lofty palaces  will be granted to them, and they will be received with greeting and salutation.",
    "Therein they shall abide for ever: how good an abode, and how good a resting-place!",
    "Say to them (O Muhammad): \"My Lord would not care for you were it not for your prayer. But now that you have given the lie to (the Message of Allah), an inextricable punishment shall soon come upon you.\"",
    "Ta'. Sin. Mim.",
    "These are the verses of the Clear Book.",
    "(O Muhammad), you will perhaps grieve yourself to death because these people do not believe.",
    "If We will, We can send down a Sign to them from heaven, so their necks will be humbled to it.",
    "Never does there come to them an admonition from the Merciful Lord but they turn away from it.",
    "They will soon come to know the truth of that which they have been scoffing at.",
    "Do they not look at the earth, how We caused a variety of fine vegetation to grow from it (in abundance)?",
    "Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.",
    "Verily Your Lord is Infinitely Mighty, Most Compassionate.",
    "(Recount to them about the time) when Your Lord called Moses: \"Go to the wrong-doing people,",
    "the people of Pharaoh: do they have no fear?\"",
    "He said: \"My Lord! I fear that they will brand me a liar.",
    "My breast is constricted and my tongue is not fluent, so endow Messengership on Aaron.",
    "As for me, they hold the charge of a crime against me. I fear they will put me to death.\"",
    "He said: \"Certainly not! So go both of you with Our Signs. We shall be with you listening to everything.",
    "Go, then, to Pharaoh and say to him: 'The Lord of the Universe has sent us",
    "that you let the Children of Israel go with us.'\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"Did we not bring you up among us when you were a child?",
    "You spent many years of your life among us and then you committed that deed of yours. You are very ungrateful indeed.\"",
    "Moses replied: \"I committed that act erringly.",
    "Then I fled for fear of you. Then my Lord bestowed wisdom and authority on me and made me one of the Messengers.",
    "Now this is the favour that you tauntingly remind me of: that you enslaved the Children of Israel!\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"And who is this Lord of the Universe?\"",
    "Moses answered: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them, if you were only to believe.\"",
    "Pharaoh said to those around him: \"Do you hear (what he says)?\"",
    "Moses said: \"(He is) Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of yore.\"",
    "Pharaoh said to the audience: \"This Messenger of yours who has been sent to you is simply mad.\"",
    "Moses continued: \"(He is) the Lord of the east and the west, and all between them. If you only had any understanding!\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"If you take any god other than me, I will certainly make you one of those (who are rotting) in prison.\"",
    "Moses said: \"Even if I were to bring a Clear Sign to you?\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"Then bring it if you are truthful at all.\"",
    "(No sooner had he said this than) Moses threw down his rod and behold, it was a veritable serpent,",
    "and he drew his hand (out of his armpit) and lo! it had become a shining object to the beholders.",
    "Pharaoh said to the nobles around him: \"Surely this man is a skilled magician",
    "who wants to drive you out of your land by his magic. Tell us, what do you advise us?\"",
    "They said: \"Detain him and his brother for a while and send forth heralds to the cities",
    "to mobilise all skilled magicians.\"",
    "So the magicians were brought together on a particular day at a set time",
    "and the people were told: \"Will you join the assembly?",
    "We may perhaps follow the religion of the magicians if they triumph.\"",
    "When the magicians came forth (for the encounter) they said to Pharaoh: \"Is there a reward for us if we triumph?\"",
    "He said: \"Yes, you will then become those near-stationed to me.\"",
    "Moses said to them: \"Throw down whatever you wish to throw.\"",
    "Thereupon they threw down their ropes and their rods, and said: \"By the glory of Pharaoh, we shall prevail.\"",
    "Thereafter, Moses threw down his rod and behold, it went about swallowing up all the false devices they had contrived.",
    "Thereupon the magicians fell down in prostration,",
    "saying: \"We (now) believe in the Lord of the Universe,",
    "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"",
    "Pharaoh said: \"You accepted the word of Moses even before I granted you the leave to do so. Surely he is your chief who has taught you magic. Soon shall you come to know. I shall cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and shall crucify all of you.\"",
    "They said: \"We do not care, for we are bound to return to our Lord,",
    "and we surely expect that Our Lord will forgive us our sins for we are the first ones to believe.\"",
    "We revealed to Moses: \"Set forth with My servants by night for you will be pursued.\"",
    "Then Pharaoh sent heralds to the cities (to mobilise troops)",
    "saying: \"These (Israelites) are only a small band of people",
    "who have certainly provoked our wrath.",
    "But we are a numerous host, ever on guard.\"",
    "Thus did We drive them out of their gardens and springs",
    "and their treasures and excellent dwellings.",
    "This happened with them; (but on the other hand), We enabled the Children of Israel to inherit those bounties.",
    "At sunrise they set off in pursuit of them",
    "and when the groups came face to face, the companions of Moses cried out: \"We are overtaken!\"",
    "Moses said: \"Certainly not. My Lord is with me; He will direct me.\"",
    "Then We revealed to Moses, (commanding him): \"Strike the sea with your rod.\" Thereupon the sea split up, and then each became like the mass of a huge mount.",
    "We also brought the other party close to the same spot,",
    "and We delivered Moses and his companions, all of them,",
    "then We drowned the others.",
    "Surely there is a Sign in this, but most of them would not believe.",
    "Verily your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Ever Compassionate.",
    "And recount to them the story of Abraham:",
    "when he asked his father and his people: \"What do you worship?\"",
    "They answered: \"There are some idols that we worship and are devoted to them with constancy.\"",
    "He asked: \"Do they hear you when you call them",
    "or do they cause you any benefit or harm?\"",
    "They answered: \"No; but we found our forefathers doing so.\"",
    "Thereupon, Abraham said: \"Have you seen (with your eyes) those whom you have been worshipping,",
    "you and your forefathers of yore?",
    "They are all enemies to me; all, except the Lord of the Universe",
    "Who created me and Who guides me;",
    "Who gives me food and drink,",
    "and Who, when I am ill, heals me;",
    "Who will cause me to die and then will again restore me to life;",
    "Who, I hope, will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement.\"",
    "(And then Abraham prayed): \"My Lord, endow me with knowledge and wisdom and join me with the righteous,",
    "and grant me an honourable reputation among posterity,",
    "and make me of those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,",
    "and forgive my father for he is among those who strayed,",
    "and disgrace me not on the Day when people will be raised to life,",
    "the Day when nothing will avail, neither wealth nor offspring,",
    "but only he that brings to Allah a sound heart will (attain to success).\"",
    "(On that Day)the Garden will be brought near to the God-fearing,",
    "and the Fire will be uncovered for those who strayed,",
    "and they will be asked: \"Where are the gods that you worshipped",
    "beside Allah? Can they be of any help to you, or even be of any help to themselves?\"",
    "Then the idols and those who strayed will be hurled into the Fire headlong, one upon another,",
    "and so too the hosts of Iblis, all of them.",
    "There they will quarrel with one another and the erring ones will say (to their deities):",
    "\"By Allah, we were surely in clear error",
    "when we assigned to you a position equal to that of the Lord of the Universe.",
    "It is none but those steeped in guilt who led us into this error,",
    "and now we have none to intercede on our behalf,",
    "nor do we have a truly sincere friend.",

    "Verily Your Lord is Immensely Mighty, Ever Compassionate.",
    "The people of Noah gave the lie to the Messengers.",

    "so fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I seek of you no reward for this: my reward is with none except the Lord of the Universe.",

    "And Solomon succeeded David and said: \"O people, we have been taught the speech of birds and we have been endowed with all kinds of things. Surely this is a conspicuous favour (from Allah).\"",
    "Hosts of jinn and humans and birds were marshalled for Solomon and were kept under full control.",
    "(Solomon was once on the move with them) until when they reached a valley of ants one of the ants said: \"O ants, get into your holes, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under their feet) without even knowing.\"",

Hold me under (Your) control that I may render thanks for the favour which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may act righteously in a manner that would please You. Include me, out of Your Mercy, among Your righteous servants.\"",

    "I will inflict a severe punishment on him or maybe even slaughter him unless he comes forth with a convincing reason (for his absence).\"",
    "Not before long the hoopoe came up and said: \"I have obtained a knowledge which you could not. I have brought for you sure news about Sheba.",

    "Allah - none is worthy of worship save He; He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.",
    "Solomon said: \"Soon shall we see whether you have spoken the truth or are one of those that lie.",
    "Take this letter of mine, deliver it to them, and then draw back from them, and observe what they do.\"",
    "The Queen said:\" Know my nobles that a gracious letter has been delivered to me.",
    "It is from Solomon, and it is: \"In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\"",
    "(It says): \"Do not act towards me with defiance, but come to me in submission.\"",
    "(After reading the letter) the Queen said: \"Nobles, let me have your counsel in this matter for I make no firm decision without you.\"",
    "They said: \"We are strong and are given to vehement fighting. But the decision is yours. Therefore, consider what you would like to command.\"",
    "The Queen said: \"When the kings enter a country they cause corruption in it and abase those of its people who are held in honour. This is what they are wont to do.",
    "I will send them a gift and then see with what answer my envoys return.\"",
    "Now, when (the envoy of the Queen) came to Solomon, he said: \"Do you want to aid me with wealth? Whatever Allah has granted me is much more than what He has given you. (Keep for yourselves) your gift in which you are exulting.",
    "Envoy, go back to those who sent you and we shall certainly come upon them with hosts whom they will be unable to resist. We shall drive them out from there, and they will suffer humiliation and disgrace.\"",
    "Solomon said: \"My nobles, which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?\"",
    "A stalwart of the jinn said: \"I will bring it to you before you rise from your council. Surely I have the power to do so and I am trustworthy.\"",
    "And he who had some knowledge of the Book said: \"I will bring it before the twinkling of your eye.\" When Solomon saw the throne placed firmly beside him, he cried out: \"This is by the grace of my Lord so that He may test me whether I give thanks for (His Bounty) or act with ingratitude. Whoever is grateful is so to his own good; and whoever is ungrateful, let him know that my Lord is Immensely Resourceful, Most Bountiful.\"",
    "Solomon said:\" Set the throne before her casually, and let us see whether she gets to the Truth or is one of those who are not guided to what is right.\"",
    "When the Queen arrived, she was asked: \"Is your throne like this one?\" She said: \"It seems as if it is the same. We had already come to know this and we had submitted ourselves.\"",
    "What prevented her (from accepting the True Faith) was her worshipping deities other than Allah, for she belonged to an unbelieving people.",
    "She was told: \"Enter the palace.\" But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and she bared both her calves (to enter into it). Solomon said: \"This is a slippery floor of crystal.\" Thereupon she cried out: \"My Lord, I have been inflicting much wrong on myself. Now I submit myself with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the whole Universe.\"",
    "And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih (with the Message): \"Serve Allah,\" but all of a sudden they became split into two quarrelling factions.",
    "Salih said: \"My people, why do you wish to hasten that evil rather than good should come upon you? Why should you not seek pardon from Allah so that mercy be shown to you?\"",
    "They said: \"We augur ill of you and those who are with you.\" Salih replied: \"Your augury is with Allah. The truth is that you are a people who are being tried.\"",
    "Now there were nine ring-leaders in the city who created corruption in the land and never worked to set things right.",
    "They said: \"Swear to one another in the name of Allah that we shall make a sudden night swoop on Salih and his family and will then tell their heirs that we did not witness the destruction of his family. We are indeed truthful.\"",
    "Thus they planned and We too planned, the while they did not know.",
    "So see what was the outcome of the plan they made: We utterly destroyed them and their people, all of them.",
    "Now behold their houses that lie in utter ruins because of their wrong-doing. Verily there is a Sign in this for the people who know.",
    "And We delivered those who believed and were wont to avoid disobeying (Allah).",
    "We also sent Lot, and recall when he told his people: \"Do you commit shameless acts with your eyes open?",
    "Do you lustfully approach men instead of women? Nay, you engage in acts of sheer ignorance.\"",
    "But this had only one answer from his people. They said: \"Expel Lot's folk from your city. They pretend to be absolutely clean.\"",
    "Eventually We saved (Lot) and his family, except his wife. We had decreed that she should be among those who would remain behind.",
    "And We rained down upon them a rain. It was an evil rain for those who had already been warned.",
    "Say, (O Muhammad): \"All praise be to Allah, and peace be on those of His servants whom He has chosen.\" (Ask them): \"Who is better: Allah or the false gods that they associate with Him as His partners?"
