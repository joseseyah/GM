    "And why should I not worship the One Who has originated me, and to Whom you will be returned.",
    "How could I take besides Him other gods whose intercession would not be of any benefit to me, nor could they save me if the Most Compassionate intended to harm me?",
    "Indeed, I would then be clearly astray.",
    "I do believe in your Lord, so listen to me.”",
    "˹But they killed him, then˺ he was told ˹by the angels˺, “Enter Paradise!” He said, “If only my people knew",
    "of how my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honourable.”",
    "We did not send any soldiers from the heavens against his people after his death, nor did We need to.",
    "All it took was one ˹mighty˺ blast, and they were extinguished at once.",
    "Oh pity, such beings! No messenger ever came to them without being mocked.",
    "Have the deniers not considered how many peoples We destroyed before them who never came back to life again?",
    "Yet they will all be brought before Us.",
    "There is a sign for them in the dead earth: We give it life, producing grain from it for them to eat.",
    "And We have placed in it gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth in it,",
    "so that they may eat from its fruit, which they had no hand in making. Will they not then give thanks?",
    "Glory be to the One Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs—˹be it˺ what the earth produces, their genders, or what they do not know!",
    "There is also a sign for them in the night: We strip from it daylight, then—behold!—they are in darkness.",
    "The sun travels for its fixed term. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.",
    "As for the moon, We have ordained ˹precise˺ phases for it, until it ends up ˹looking˺ like an old, curved palm stalk.",
    "It is not for the sun to catch up with the moon, nor does the night outrun the day. Each is travelling in an orbit of their own.",
    "Another sign for them is that We carried their ancestors ˹with Noah˺ in the fully loaded Ark,",
    "and created for them similar things to ride in.",
    "If We willed, We could drown them: then no one would respond to their cries, nor would they be rescued—",
    "except by mercy from Us, allowing them enjoyment for a ˹little˺ while.",
    "˹Still they turn away˺ when it is said to them, “Beware of what is ahead of you ˹in the Hereafter˺ and what is behind you ˹of destroyed nations˺ so you may be shown mercy.”",
    "Whenever a sign comes to them from their Lord, they turn away from it.",
    "And when it is said to them, “Donate from what Allah has provided for you,” the disbelievers say to the believers, “Why should we feed those whom Allah could have fed if He wanted to? You are clearly astray!”",
    "And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”",
    "They must be awaiting a single Blast, which will seize them while they are ˹entrenched˺ in ˹worldly˺ disputes.",
    "Then they will not be able to make a ˹last˺ will, nor can they return to their own people.",
    "The Trumpet will be blown ˹a second time˺, then—behold!—they will rush from the graves to their Lord.",
    "They will cry, “Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of rest? This must be what the Most Compassionate warned us of; the messengers told the truth!”",
    "It will only take one Blast, then at once they will all be brought before Us.",
    "On that Day no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be rewarded except for what you used to do.",
    "Indeed, on that Day the residents of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves.",
    "They and their spouses will be in ˹cool˺ shade, reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches.",
    "There they will have fruits and whatever they desire.",
    "And “Peace!” will be ˹their˺ greeting from the Merciful Lord.",
    "˹Then the disbelievers will be told,˺ “Step away ˹from the believers˺ this Day, O  wicked ones!",
    "Did I not command you, O  Children of Adam, not to follow Satan, for he is truly your sworn enemy,",
    "but to worship Me ˹alone˺? This is the Straight Path.",
    "Yet he already misled great multitudes of you. Did you not have any sense?",
    "This is the Hell you were warned of.",
    "Burn in it Today for your disbelief.”",
    "On this Day We will seal their mouths, their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify to what they used to commit.",
    "Had We willed, We could have easily blinded their eyes, so they would struggle to find their way. How then could they see?",
    "And had We willed, We could have transfigured them on the spot, so they could neither progress forward nor turn back.",
    "And whoever We grant a long life, We reverse them in development. Will they not then understand?",
    "We have not taught him poetry, nor is it fitting for him. This ˹Book˺ is only a Reminder and a clear Quran",
    "to warn whoever is ˹truly˺ alive and fulfil the decree ˹of torment˺ against the disbelievers.",
    "Do they not see that We singlehandedly created for them, among other things, cattle which are under their control?",
    "And We have subjected these ˹animals˺ to them, so they may ride some and eat others.",
    "And they derive from them other benefits and drinks. Will they not then give thanks?",
    "Still they have taken other gods besides Allah, hoping to be helped ˹by them˺.",
    "They cannot help the pagans, even though they serve the idols as dedicated guards.",
    "So do not let their words grieve you ˹O Prophet˺. Indeed, We ˹fully˺ know what they conceal and what they reveal.",
    "Do people not see that We have created them from a sperm-drop, then—behold!—they openly challenge ˹Us˺?",
    "And they argue with Us—forgetting they were created—saying, “Who will give life to decayed bones?”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “They will be revived by the One Who produced them the first time, for He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of every created being.",
    "˹He is the One˺ Who gives you fire from green trees, and—behold!—you kindle ˹fire˺ from them.",
    "Can the One Who created the heavens and the earth not ˹easily˺ resurrect these ˹deniers˺?” Yes ˹He can˺! For He is the Master Creator, All-Knowing.",
    "All it takes, when He wills something ˹to be˺, is simply to say to it: “Be!” And it is!",
    "So glory be to the One in Whose Hands is the authority over all things, and to Whom ˹alone˺ you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
    "By those ˹angels˺ lined up in ranks,",
    "and those who diligently drive ˹the clouds˺,",
    "and those who recite the Reminder!",
    "Surely your God is One!",
    "˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, and the Lord of all points of sunrise.",
    "Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with the stars for decoration",
    "and ˹for˺ protection from every rebellious devil.",
    "They cannot listen to the highest assembly ˹of angels˺ for they are pelted from every side,",
    "˹fiercely˺ driven away. And they will suffer an everlasting torment.",
    "But whoever manages to stealthily eavesdrop is ˹instantly˺ pursued by a piercing flare.",
    "So ask them ˹O Prophet˺, which is harder to create: them or other marvels of Our creation? Indeed, We created them from a sticky clay.",
    "In fact, you are astonished ˹by their denial˺, while they ridicule ˹you˺.",
    "When they are reminded, they are never mindful.",
    "And whenever they see a sign, they make fun of it,",
    "saying, “This is nothing but pure magic.",
    "When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected?",
    "And our forefathers as well?”",
    "Say, “Yes! And you will be fully humbled.”",
    "It will only take one Blast, then at once they will see ˹it all˺.",
    "They will cry, “Oh, woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!”",
    "˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision which you used to deny.”",
    "˹Allah will say to the angels,˺ “Gather ˹all˺ the wrongdoers along with their peers, and whatever they used to worship",
    "instead of Allah, then lead them ˹all˺ to the path of Hell.",
    "And detain them, for they must be questioned.”",
    "˹Then they will be asked,˺ “What is the matter with you that you can no longer help each other?”",
    "In fact, on that Day they will be ˹fully˺ submissive.",
    "They will turn on each other, throwing blame.",
    "The misled will say, “It was you who deluded us away from what is right.”",
    "The misleaders will reply, “No! You disbelieved on your own.",
    "We had no authority over you. In fact, you yourselves were a transgressing people.",
    "The decree of our Lord has come to pass against us ˹all˺: we will certainly taste ˹the punishment˺.",
    "We caused you to deviate, for we ourselves were deviant.”",
    "Surely on that Day they will ˹all˺ share in the punishment.",
    "That is certainly how We deal with the wicked.",
    "For whenever it was said to them ˹in the world˺, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah,” they acted arrogantly",
    "and argued, “Should we really abandon our gods for a mad poet?”",
    "In fact, he came with the truth, confirming ˹earlier˺ messengers.",
    "You will certainly taste the painful torment,",
    "and will only be rewarded for what you used to do.",
    "But not the chosen servants of Allah.",
    "They will have a known provision:",
    "fruits ˹of every type˺. And they will be honoured",
    "in the Gardens of Bliss,",
    "facing each other on thrones.",
    "A drink ˹of pure wine˺ will be passed around to them from a flowing stream:",
    "crystal-white, delicious to drink.",
    "It will neither harm ˹them˺, nor will they be intoxicated by it.",
    "And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and gorgeous eyes,",
    "as if they were pristine pearls. ",
    "Then they will turn to one another inquisitively.",
    "One of them will say, “I once had a companion ˹in the world˺",
    "who used to ask ˹me˺, ‘Do you actually believe ˹in resurrection˺?",
    "When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be brought to judgment?’”",
    "He will ˹then˺ ask, “Would you care to see ˹his fate˺?”",
    "Then he ˹and the others˺ will look and spot him in the midst of the Hellfire.",
    "He will ˹then˺ say, “By Allah! You nearly ruined me.",
    "Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I ˹too˺ would have certainly been among those brought ˹to Hell˺.”",
    "˹Then he will ask his fellow believers,˺ “Can you imagine that we will never die,",
    "except our first death, nor be punished ˹like the others˺?”",
    "This is truly the ultimate triumph.",
    "For such ˹honour˺ all should strive.",
    "Is this ˹bliss˺ a better accommodation or the tree of Zaqqûm?",
    "We have surely made it a test for the wrongdoers.",
    "Indeed, it is a tree that grows in the depths of Hell,",
    "bearing fruit like devils’ heads.",
    "The evildoers will certainly ˹be left to˺ eat from it, filling up their bellies with it.",
    "Then on top of that they will be given a blend of boiling drink.",
    "Then they will ultimately return to ˹their place in˺ Hell.",
    "Indeed, they found their forefathers astray,",
    "so they rushed in their footsteps!",
    "And surely most of the earlier generations had strayed before them,",
    "although We had certainly sent warners among them.",
    "See then what was the end of those who had been warned.",
    "But not the chosen servants of Allah.",
    "Indeed, Noah cried out to Us, and how excellent are We in responding!",
    "We delivered him and his family from the great distress,",
    "and made his descendants the sole survivors.",
    "And We blessed him ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations:",
    "“Peace be upon Noah among all peoples.”",
    "Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "˹For˺ he was truly one of Our faithful servants.",
    "Then We drowned the others.",
    "And indeed, one of those who followed his way was Abraham.",
    "˹Remember˺ when he came to his Lord with a pure heart,",
    "and said to his father and his people, “What are you worshipping?",
    "Is it false gods that you desire instead of Allah?",
    "What then do you expect from the Lord of all worlds?”",
    "He later looked up to the stars ˹in contemplation˺,",
    "then said, “I am really sick.”",
    "So they turned their backs on him and went away.",
    "Then he ˹stealthily˺ advanced towards their gods, and said ˹mockingly˺, “Will you not eat ˹your offerings˺?",
    "What is wrong with you that you cannot speak?”",
    "Then he swiftly turned on them, striking ˹them˺ with his right hand.",
    "Later, his people came rushing towards him ˹furiously˺.",
    "He argued, “How can you worship what you carve ˹with your own hands˺,",
    "when it is Allah Who created you and whatever you do?”",
    "They said ˹to one another˺, “Build him a furnace and cast him into the blazing fire.”",
    "And so they sought to harm him, but We made them inferior.",
    "He later said, “I am leaving ˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He will guide me.",
    "My Lord! Bless me with righteous offspring.”",
    "So We gave him good news of a forbearing son.",
    "Then when the boy reached the age to work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son! I have seen in a dream that I ˹must˺ sacrifice you. So tell me what you think.” He replied, “O my dear father! Do as you are commanded. Allah willing, you will find me steadfast.”",
    "Then when they submitted ˹to Allah’s Will˺, and Abraham laid him on the side of his forehead ˹for sacrifice˺,",
    "We called out to him, “O Abraham!",
    "You have already fulfilled the vision.” Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "That was truly a revealing test.",
    "And We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice,",
    "and blessed Abraham ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations:",
    "“Peace be upon Abraham.”",
    "This is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "He was truly one of Our faithful servants.",
    "We ˹later˺ gave him good news of Isaac—a prophet, and one of the righteous.",
    "We blessed him and Isaac as well. Some of their descendants did good, while others clearly wronged themselves.",
    "And We certainly showed favour to Moses and Aaron,",
    "and delivered them and their people from the great distress.",
    "We helped them so it was they who prevailed.",
    "We gave them the clear Scripture,",
    "and guided them to the Straight Path.",
    "And We blessed them ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations:",
    "“Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.”",
    "Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "They were truly ˹two˺ of Our faithful servants.",
    "And Elias was indeed one of the messengers.",
    "˹Remember˺ when he said to his people, “Will you not fear ˹Allah˺?",
    "Do you call upon ˹the idol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators—",
    "Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?”",
    "But they rejected him, so they will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺.",
    "But not the chosen servants of Allah.",
    "We blessed him ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations:",
    "“Peace be upon Elias.”",
    "Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "He was truly one of Our faithful servants.",
    "And Lot was indeed one of the messengers.",
    "˹Remember˺ when We delivered him and all of his family,",
    "except an old woman, who was one of the doomed.",
    "Then We ˹utterly˺ destroyed the rest.",
    "You ˹Meccans˺ certainly pass by their ruins day",
    "and night. Will you not then understand?",
    "And Jonah was indeed one of the messengers.",
    "˹Remember˺ when he fled to the overloaded ship.",
    "Then ˹to save it from sinking,˺ he drew straws ˹with other passengers˺. He lost ˹and was thrown overboard˺.",
    "Then the whale engulfed him while he was blameworthy.",
    "Had he not ˹constantly˺ glorified ˹Allah˺,",
    "he would have certainly remained in its belly until the Day of Resurrection.",
    "But We cast him onto the open ˹shore˺, ˹totally˺ worn out,",
    "and caused a squash plant to grow over him.",
    "We ˹later˺ sent him ˹back˺ to ˹his city of˺ at least one hundred thousand people,",
    "who then believed ˹in him˺, so We allowed them enjoyment for a while.",
    "Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ if your Lord has daughters, while the pagans ˹prefer to˺ have sons.",
    "Or ˹ask them˺ if We created the angels as females right before their eyes.",
    "Indeed, it is one of their ˹outrageous˺ fabrications to say,",
    "“Allah has children.” They are simply liars.",
    "Has He chosen daughters over sons?",
    "What is the matter with you? How do you judge?",
    "Will you not then be mindful?",
    "Or do you have ˹any˺ compelling proof?",
    "Then bring ˹us˺ your scripture, if what you say is true!",
    "They have also established a ˹marital˺ relationship between Him and the jinn. Yet the jinn ˹themselves˺ know well that such people will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺.",
    "Glorified is Allah far above what they claim!",
    "But not the chosen servants of Allah.",
    "Surely you ˹pagans˺ and whatever ˹idols˺ you worship",
    "can never lure ˹anyone˺ away from Him",
    "except those ˹destined˺ to burn in Hell.",
    "˹The angels respond,˺ “There is not one of us without an assigned station ˹of worship˺.",
    "We are indeed the ones lined up in ranks ˹for Allah˺.",
    "And we are indeed the ones ˹constantly˺ glorifying ˹His praise˺.”",
    "They certainly used to say,",
    "“If only we had a Reminder like ˹those of˺ earlier peoples,",
    "we would have truly been Allah’s devoted servants.”",
    "But ˹now˺ they reject it, so they will soon know.",
    "Our Word has already gone forth to Our servants, the messengers,",
    "that they would surely be helped,",
    "and that Our forces will certainly prevail.",
    "So turn away from the deniers for a while ˹O Prophet˺.",
    "You will see ˹what will happen to˺ them, and they too will see!",
    "Do they ˹really˺ wish to hasten Our punishment?",
    "Yet when it descends upon them: how evil will that morning be for those who had been warned!",
    "And turn away from them for a while.",
    "You will see, and they too will see!",
    "Glorified is your Lord—the Lord of Honour and Power—above what they claim!",
    "Peace be upon the messengers.",
    "And praise be to Allah—Lord of all worlds.",
    "Ṣãd. By the Quran, full of reminders!",
    "˹This is the truth,˺ yet the disbelievers are ˹entrenched˺ in arrogance and opposition.",
    "˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We destroyed before them, and they cried out when it was too late to escape.",
    "Now, the pagans are astonished that a warner has come to them from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, “This is a magician, a total liar!",
    "Has he reduced ˹all˺ the gods to One God? Indeed, this is something totally astonishing.”",
    "The chiefs among them went forth saying, “Carry on, and stand firm in devotion to your gods. Certainly this is just a scheme ˹for power˺.",
    "We have never heard of this in the previous faith. This is nothing but a fabrication.",
    "Has the Reminder been revealed ˹only˺ to him out of ˹all of˺ us?” In fact, they are ˹only˺ in doubt of My ˹revealed˺ Reminder. In fact, ˹they do so because˺ they have not yet tasted My punishment.",
    "Or ˹is it because˺ they possess the treasuries of the mercy of your Lord—the Almighty, the Giver ˹of all bounties˺.",
    "Or ˹is it because˺ the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between belongs to them? Let them then climb their way ˹to heaven, if their claim is true˺.",
    "This is just another ˹enemy˺ force bound for defeat out there.",
    "Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺, as did ’Âd, Pharaoh of the mighty structures,",
    "Thamûd, the people of Lot, and the residents of the Forest. These were ˹all˺ enemy forces.",
    "Each rejected their messenger, so My punishment was justified.",
    "These ˹pagans˺ are awaiting nothing but a single Blast that cannot be stopped.",
    "They say ˹mockingly˺, “Our Lord! Hasten for us our share ˹of the punishment˺ before the Day of Reckoning.”",
    "Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And remember Our servant, David, the man of strength. Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺.",
    "We truly subjected the mountains to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with him in the evening and after sunrise.",
    "And ˹We subjected˺ the birds, flocking together. All turned to him ˹echoing his hymns˺.",
    "We strengthened his kingship, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment.",
    "Has the story of the two plaintiffs, who scaled the ˹wall of David’s˺ sanctuary, reached you ˹O Prophet˺?",
    "When they came into David’s presence, he was startled by them. They said, “Have no fear. ˹We are merely˺ two in a dispute: one of us has wronged the other. So judge between us with truth—do not go beyond ˹it˺—and guide us to the right way.",
    "This is my brother. He has ninety-nine sheep while I have ˹only˺ one. ˹Still˺ he asked me to give it up to him, overwhelming me with ˹his˺ argument.”",
    "David ˹eventually˺ ruled, “He has definitely wronged you in demanding ˹to add˺ your sheep to his. And certainly many partners wrong each other, except those who believe and do good—but how few are they!” Then David realized that We had tested him so he asked for his Lord’s forgiveness, fell down in prostration, and turned ˹to Him in repentance˺.",
    "So We forgave that for him. And he will indeed have ˹a status of˺ closeness to Us and an honourable destination!",
    "˹We instructed him:˺ “O David! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between people with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you astray from Allah’s Way. Surely those who go astray from Allah’s Way will suffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.”",
    "We have not created the heavens and earth and everything in between without purpose—as the disbelievers think. So woe to the disbelievers because of the Fire!",
    "Or should We treat those who believe and do good like those who make mischief throughout the land? Or should We treat the righteous like the wicked?",
    "˹This is˺ a blessed Book which We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ so that they may contemplate its verses, and people of reason may be mindful.",
    "And We blessed David with Solomon—what an excellent servant ˹he was˺! Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺.",
    "˹Remember˺ when the well-trained, swift horses were paraded before him in the evening.",
    "He then proclaimed, “I am truly in love with ˹these˺ fine things out of remembrance for my Lord,” until they went out of sight.",
    "˹He ordered,˺ “Bring them back to me!” Then he began to rub down their legs and necks. ",
    "And indeed, We tested Solomon, placing a ˹deformed˺ body on his throne, then he turned ˹to Allah in repentance˺.",
    "He prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me, and grant me an authority that will never be matched by anyone after me. You are indeed the Giver ˹of all bounties˺.”",
    "So We subjected to him the wind, blowing gently at his command to wherever he pleased.",
    "And ˹We subjected to him˺ every builder and diver of the jinn,",
    "and others bound together in chains.",
    "˹Allah said,˺ “This is Our gift, so give or withhold ˹as you wish˺, never to be called to account.”",
    "And he will indeed have ˹a status of˺ closeness to Us and an honourable destination!",
    "And remember Our servant Job, when he cried out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me with distress and suffering.”",
    "˹We responded,˺ “Stomp your foot: ˹now˺ here is a cool ˹and refreshing˺ spring for washing and drinking.”",
    "And We gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for people of reason.",
    "˹And We said to him,˺ “Take in your hand a bundle of grass, and strike ˹your wife˺ with it, and do not break your oath.” We truly found him patient. What an excellent servant ˹he was˺! Indeed, he ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺.",
    "And remember Our servants: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the men of strength and insight.",
    "We truly chose them for the honour of proclaiming the Hereafter.",
    "And in Our sight they are truly among the chosen and the finest.",
    "Also remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Ⱬul-Kifl. All are among the best.",
    "This is ˹all˺ a reminder. And the righteous will certainly have an honourable destination:",
    "the Gardens of Eternity, whose gates will be open for them.",
    "There they will recline, calling for abundant fruit and drink.",
    "And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and equal age.",
    "This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.",
    "This is indeed Our provision that will never end.",
    "That is that. And the transgressors will certainly have the worst destination:",
    "Hell, where they will burn. What an evil place to rest!",
    "Let them then taste this: boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus,",
    "and other torments of the same sort!",
    "˹The misleaders will say to one another,˺ “Here is a crowd ˹of followers˺ being thrown in with us. They are not welcome, ˹for˺ they ˹too˺ will burn in the Fire.”",
    "The followers will respond, “No! You are not welcome! You brought this upon us. What an evil place for settlement!”",
    "Adding, “Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, double their punishment in the Fire.”",
    "The tyrants will ask ˹one another˺, “But why do we not see those we considered to be lowly?",
    "Were we wrong in mocking them ˹in the world˺? Or do our eyes ˹just˺ fail to see them ˹in the Fire˺?”",
    "This dispute between the residents of the Fire will certainly come to pass.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a warner. And there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah—the One, the Supreme.",
    "˹He is the˺ Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between—the Almighty, Most Forgiving.”",
    "Say, “This ˹Quran˺ is momentous news,",
    "from which you ˹pagans˺ are turning away.”",
    "˹And say,˺ “I had no knowledge of the highest assembly ˹in heaven˺ when they differed ˹concerning Adam˺.",
    "What is revealed to me is that I am only sent with a clear warning.”",
    "˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from clay.",
    "So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”",
    "So the angels prostrated all together—",
    "but not Iblîs, who acted arrogantly, becoming unfaithful.",
    "Allah asked, “O Iblîs! What prevented you from prostrating to what I created with My Own Hands? Did you ˹just˺ become proud? Or have you always been arrogant?”",
    "He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.”",
    "Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you are truly cursed.",
    "And surely upon you is My condemnation until the Day of Judgment.”",
    "Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”",
    "Allah said, “You will be delayed",
    "until the appointed Day.”",
    "Satan said, “By Your Glory! I will certainly mislead them all,",
    "except Your chosen servants among them.”",
    "Allah concluded, “The truth is—and I ˹only˺ say the truth—:",
    "I will surely fill up Hell with you and whoever follows you from among them, all together.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹Quran˺, nor do I pretend to be someone I am not.",
    "It is only a reminder to the whole world.",
    "And you will certainly know its truth before long.”",
    "The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "Indeed, We have sent down the Book to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth, so worship Allah ˹alone˺, being sincerely devoted to Him.",
    "Indeed, sincere devotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah. As for those who take other lords besides Him, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah,” surely Allah will judge between all regarding what they differed about. Allah certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and disbelief.",
    "Had it been Allah’s Will to have offspring, He could have chosen whatever He willed of His creation. Glory be to Him! He is Allah—the One, the Supreme.",
    "He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He wraps the night around the day, and wraps the day around the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He is truly the Almighty, Most Forgiving.",
    "He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul, then from it He made its mate. And He produced for you four pairs of cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away?",
    "If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful ˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
    "When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.”",
    "˹Are they better˺ or those who worship ˹their Lord˺ devoutly in the hours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of their Lord? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.",
    "Say ˹O Prophet, that Allah says˺, “O My servants who believe! Be mindful of your Lord. Those who do good in this world will have a good reward. And Allah’s earth is spacious. Only those who endure patiently will be given their reward without limit.”",
    "Say, “I am commanded to worship Allah, being sincerely devoted to Him ˹alone˺.",
    "And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit ˹to His Will˺.”",
    "Say, “I truly fear—if I were to disobey my Lord—the torment of a tremendous Day.”",
    "Say, “It is ˹only˺ Allah that I worship, being sincere in my devotion to Him.",
    "Worship then whatever ˹gods˺ you want instead of Him.” Say, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on Judgment Day. That is indeed the clearest loss.”",
    "They will have layers of fire above and below them. That is what Allah warns His servants with. So fear Me, O  My servants!",
    "And those who shun the worship of false gods, turning to Allah ˹alone˺, will have good news. So give good news to My servants ˹O Prophet˺—",
    "those who listen to what is said and follow the best of it. These are the ones ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, and these are ˹truly˺ the people of reason.",
    "What about those against whom the decree of torment has been justified? Is it you ˹O Prophet˺ who will then save those bound for the Fire?",
    "But those mindful of their Lord will have ˹elevated˺ mansions, built one above the other, under which rivers flow. ˹That is˺ the promise of Allah. ˹And˺ Allah never fails in ˹His˺ promise.",
    "Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it through streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various colours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces them to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason.",
    "Can ˹the misguided be like˺ those whose hearts Allah has opened to Islam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened at the remembrance of Allah! It is they who are clearly astray.",
    "˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect consistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin ˹and hearts˺ of those who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the mention of ˹the mercy of˺ Allah. That is the guidance of Allah, through which He guides whoever He wills. But whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.",
    "Are those who will only have their ˹bare˺ faces to shield themselves from the awful torment on Judgment Day ˹better than those in Paradise˺? It will ˹then˺ be said to the wrongdoers: “Reap what you sowed!”",
    "Those before them ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺, then the torment came upon them from where they least expected.",
    "So Allah made them taste humiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the Hereafter, if only they knew.",
    "We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this Quran, so perhaps they will be mindful.",
    "˹It is˺ a Quran ˹revealed˺ in Arabic without any crookedness, so perhaps they will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.",
    "Allah sets forth the parable of a slave owned by several quarrelsome masters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in condition? Praise be to Allah! In fact, most of them do not know.",
    "You ˹O Prophet˺ will certainly die, and they will die too.",
    "Then on the Day of Judgment you will ˹all settle your˺ dispute before your Lord."
