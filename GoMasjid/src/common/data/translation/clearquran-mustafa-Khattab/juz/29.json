    "Blessed is the One in Whose Hands rests all authority. And He is Most Capable of everything.",
    "˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving.",
    "˹He is the One˺ Who created seven heavens, one above the other. You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate. So look again: do you see any flaws?",
    "Then look again and again—your sight will return frustrated and weary.",
    "And indeed, We adorned the lowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps, and made them ˹as missiles˺ for stoning ˹eavesdropping˺ devils, for whom We have also prepared the torment of the Blaze. ",
    "Those who disbelieve in their Lord will suffer the punishment of Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "When they are tossed into it, they will hear its roaring as it boils over,",
    "almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is cast into it, its keepers will ask them, “Did a warner not come to you?”",
    "They will reply, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.’”",
    "And they will lament, “If only we had listened and reasoned, we would not be among the residents of the Blaze!”",
    "And so they will confess their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze!",
    "Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him will have forgiveness and a mighty reward.",
    "Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
    "How could He not know His Own creation? For He ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.",
    "He is the One Who smoothed out the earth for you, so move about in its regions and eat from His provisions. And to Him is the resurrection ˹of all˺.",
    "Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up as it quakes violently?",
    "Or do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not unleash upon you a storm of stones. Only then would you know how ˹serious˺ My warning was!",
    "And certainly those before them denied ˹as well˺, then how severe was My response!",
    "Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything.",
    "Also, which ˹powerless˺ force will come to your help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are only ˹lost˺ in delusion.",
    "Or who is it that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion ˹to the truth˺.",
    "Who is ˹rightly˺ guided: the one who crawls facedown or the one who walks upright on the Straight Path?",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is the One Who brought you into being and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.”",
    "˹Also˺ say, “He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.”",
    "˹Still˺ they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “That knowledge is with Allah alone, and I am only sent with a clear warning.”",
    "Then when they see the torment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and it will be said ˹to them˺, “This is what you claimed would never come.” ",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”",
    "Say, “He is the Most Compassionate—in Him ˹alone˺ we believe, and in Him ˹alone˺ we trust. You will soon know who is clearly astray.”",
    "Say, “Consider this: if your water were to sink ˹into the earth˺, then who ˹else˺ could bring you flowing water?”",
    "Nũn. By the pen and what everyone writes!",
    "By the grace of your Lord, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not insane.",
    "You will certainly have a never-ending reward.",
    "And you are truly ˹a man˺ of outstanding character.",
    "Soon you and the pagans will see,",
    "which of you is mad.",
    "Surely your Lord ˹alone˺ knows best who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.",
    "So do not give in to the deniers.",
    "They wish you would compromise so they would yield ˹to you˺.",
    "And do not obey the despicable, vain oath-taker,",
    "slanderer, gossip-monger,",
    "withholder of good, transgressor, evildoer,",
    "brute, and—on top of all that—an illegitimate child.",
    "Now, ˹simply˺ because he has been blessed with ˹abundant˺ wealth and children,",
    "whenever Our revelations are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables!”",
    "We will soon mark his snout. ",
    "Indeed, We have tested those ˹Meccans˺ as We tested the owners of the garden—when they swore they would surely harvest ˹all˺ its fruit in the early morning,",
    "leaving no thought for Allah’s Will.",
    "Then it was struck by a torment from your Lord while they slept,",
    "so it was reduced to ashes.",
    "Then by daybreak they called out to each other,",
    "˹saying,˺ “Go early to your harvest, if you want to pick ˹all˺ the fruit.”",
    "So they went off, whispering to one another,",
    "“Do not let any poor person enter your garden today.”",
    "And they proceeded early, totally fixated on their purpose.",
    "But when they saw it ˹devastated˺, they cried, “We must have lost ˹our˺ way!",
    "In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.”",
    "The most sensible of them said, “Did I not urge you to say, ‘Allah willing.’?”",
    "They replied, “Glory be to our Lord! We have truly been wrongdoers.”",
    "Then they turned on each other, throwing blame.",
    "They said, “Woe to us! We have certainly been transgressors.",
    "We trust our Lord will give us a better garden than this, ˹for˺ we are indeed turning to our Lord with hope.”",
    "That is the ˹way of Our˺ punishment ˹in this world˺. But the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly far worse, if only they knew. ",
    "Indeed, the righteous will have the Gardens of Bliss with their Lord.",
    "Should We then treat those who have submitted like the wicked?",
    "What is the matter with you? How do you judge?",
    "Or do you have a scripture, in which you read",
    "that you will have whatever you choose?",
    "Or do you have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Judgment that you will have whatever you decide?",
    "Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ which of them can guarantee all that.",
    "Or do they have associate-gods ˹supporting this claim˺? Then let them bring forth their associate-gods, if what they say is true.",
    "˹Beware of˺ the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared, and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so,",
    "with eyes downcast, totally covered with disgrace. For they were ˹always˺ called to prostrate ˹in the world˺ when they were fully capable ˹but they chose not to˺.",
    "So leave to Me ˹O Prophet˺ those who reject this message. We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.",
    "I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.",
    "Or are you asking them for a reward ˹for the message˺ so that they are overburdened by debt?",
    "Or do they have access to ˹the Record in˺ the unseen, so they copy it ˹for all to see˺?",
    "So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not be like ˹Jonah,˺ the Man of the Whale, who cried out ˹to Allah˺, in total distress.",
    "Had he not been shown grace by his Lord, he would have certainly been cast onto the open ˹shore˺, still blameworthy.",
    "Then his Lord chose him, making him one of the righteous.",
    "The disbelievers would almost cut you down with their eyes when they hear ˹you recite˺ the Reminder, and say, “He is certainly a madman.”",
    "But it is simply a reminder to the whole world.",
    "The Inevitable Hour!",
    "What is the Inevitable Hour?",
    "And what will make you realize what the Inevitable Hour is?",
    "˹Both˺ Thamûd and ’Ȃd denied the Striking Disaster.",
    "As for Thamûd, they were destroyed by an overwhelming blast.",
    "And as for ’Ȃd, they were destroyed by a furious, bitter wind",
    "which Allah unleashed on them non-stop for seven nights and eight days, so that you would have seen its people lying dead like trunks of uprooted palm trees.",
    "Do you see any of them left alive?",
    "Also, Pharaoh and those before him, and ˹the people of˺ the overturned cities ˹of Lot˺ indulged in sin,",
    "each disobeying their Lord’s messenger, so He seized them with a crushing grip.",
    "Indeed, when the floodwater had overflowed, We carried you in the floating Ark ˹with Noah˺,",
    "so that We may make this a reminder to you, and that attentive ears may grasp it.",
    "At last, when the Trumpet will be blown with one blast,",
    "and the earth and mountains will be lifted up and crushed with one blow,",
    "on that Day the Inevitable Event will have come to pass.",
    "The sky will then be so torn that it will be frail,",
    "with the angels on its sides. On that Day eight ˹mighty angels˺ will bear the Throne of your Lord above them.",
    "You will then be presented ˹before Him for judgment˺, and none of your secrets will stay hidden.",
    "As for those given their records in their right hand, they will cry ˹happily˺, “Here ˹everyone˺! Read my record!",
    "I surely knew I would face my reckoning.”",
    "They will be in a life of bliss,",
    "in an elevated Garden,",
    "whose fruit will hang within reach.",
    "˹They will be told,˺ “Eat and drink joyfully for what you did in the days gone by.”",
    "And as for those given their record in their left hand, they will cry ˹bitterly˺, “I wish I had not been given my record,",
    "nor known anything of my reckoning!",
    "I wish death was the end!",
    "My wealth has not benefited me!",
    "My authority has been stripped from me.”",
    "˹It will be said,˺ “Seize and shackle them,",
    "then burn them in Hell,",
    "then tie them up with chains seventy arms long.",
    "For they never had faith in Allah, the Greatest,",
    "nor encouraged the feeding of the poor.",
    "So this Day they will have no close friend here,",
    "nor any food except ˹oozing˺ pus,",
    "which none will eat except the evildoers.”",
    "Now, I do swear by whatever you see,",
    "and whatever you cannot see!",
    "Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the recitation of a noble Messenger.",
    "It is not the prose of a poet ˹as you claim˺, ˹yet˺ you hardly have any faith.",
    "Nor is it the mumbling of a fortune-teller, ˹yet˺ you are hardly mindful.",
    "˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds.",
    "Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name,",
    "We would have certainly seized him by his right hand,",
    "then severed his aorta,",
    "and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!",
    "Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder to those mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
    "And We certainly know that some of you will persist in denial,",
    "and it will surely be a source of regret for the disbelievers.",
    "And indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the absolute truth.",
    "So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest.",
    "A challenger has demanded a punishment bound to come",
    "for the disbelievers—to be averted by none—",
    "from Allah, Lord of pathways of ˹heavenly˺ ascent,",
    "˹through which˺ the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit will ascend to Him on a Day fifty thousand years in length.",
    "So endure ˹this denial, O  Prophet,˺ with beautiful patience.",
    "They truly see this ˹Day˺ as impossible,",
    "but We see it as inevitable.",
    "On that Day the sky will be like molten brass",
    "and the mountains like ˹tufts of˺ wool.",
    "And no close friend will ask ˹about˺ their friends,",
    "˹although˺ they will be made to see each other. The wicked will wish to ransom themselves from the punishment of that Day by their children,",
    "their spouses, their siblings,",
    "their clan that sheltered them,",
    "and everyone on earth altogether, just to save themselves.",
    "But no! There will certainly be a raging Flame",
    "ripping off scalps.",
    "It will summon whoever turned their backs ˹on Allah˺ and turned away ˹from the truth˺,",
    "and gathered and hoarded ˹wealth˺.",
    "Indeed, humankind was created impatient:",
    "distressed when touched with evil,",
    "and withholding when touched with good—",
    "except those who pray,",
    "consistently performing their prayers;",
    "and who give the rightful share of their wealth",
    "to the beggar and the poor;",
    "and who ˹firmly˺ believe in the Day of Judgment;",
    "and those who fear the punishment of their Lord—",
    "˹knowing that˺ none should feel secure from their Lord’s punishment—",
    "and those who guard their chastity",
    "except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame,",
    "but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors.",
    "˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts and covenants;",
    "and who are honest in their testimony;",
    "and who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers.",
    "These will be in Gardens, held in honour.",
    "So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they rush ˹head-long˺ towards you ˹O Prophet˺,",
    "from the right and the left, in groups ˹to mock you˺?",
    "Does every one of them expect to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss?",
    "But no! Indeed, they ˹already˺ know what We created them from.",
    "So, I do swear by the Lord of ˹all˺ the points of sunrise and sunset that We are truly capable",
    "of replacing them with ˹others˺ better than them, and We cannot be prevented ˹from doing so˺.",
    "So let them indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until they face their Day, which they have been threatened with—",
    "the Day they will come forth from the graves swiftly, as if racing to an idol ˹for a blessing˺,",
    "with eyes downcast, utterly covered with disgrace. That is the Day they have ˹always˺ been warned of.",
    "Indeed, We sent Noah to his people ˹saying to him˺, “Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them.”",
    "Noah proclaimed, “O my people! I am truly sent to you with a clear warning:",
    "worship Allah ˹alone˺, fear Him, and obey me.",
    "He will forgive your sins, and delay your end until the appointed time. Indeed, when the time set by Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, if only you knew!”",
    "He cried, “My Lord! I have surely called my people day and night,",
    "but my calls only made them run farther away.",
    "And whenever I invite them to be forgiven by You, they press their fingers into their ears, cover themselves with their clothes, persist ˹in denial˺, and act very arrogantly.",
    "Then I certainly called them openly,",
    "then I surely preached to them publicly and privately,",
    "saying, ‘Seek your Lord’s forgiveness, ˹for˺ He is truly Most Forgiving.",
    "He will shower you with abundant rain,",
    "supply you with wealth and children, and give you gardens as well as rivers.",
    "What is the matter with you that you are not in awe of the Majesty of Allah,",
    "when He truly created you in stages ˹of development˺?",
    "Do you not see how Allah created seven heavens, one above the other,",
    "placing the moon within them as a ˹reflected˺ light, and the sun as a ˹radiant˺ lamp?",
    "Allah ˹alone˺ caused you to grow from the earth like a plant.",
    "Then He will return you to it, and then simply bring you forth ˹again˺.",
    "And Allah ˹alone˺ spread out the earth for you",
    "to walk along its spacious pathways.’”",
    "˹Eventually,˺ Noah cried, “My Lord! They have certainly persisted in disobeying me, and followed ˹instead˺ those ˹elite˺ whose ˹abundant˺ wealth and children only increase them in loss,",
    "and who have devised a tremendous plot,",
    "urging ˹their followers˺, ‘Do not abandon your idols—especially Wadd, Suwâ’, Yaghûth, Ya’ûq, and Nasr.’",
    "Those ˹elite˺ have already led many astray. So ˹O Lord˺, only allow the wrongdoers to stray farther away.”",
    "So because of their sins, they were drowned, then admitted into the Fire. And they found none to help them against Allah.",
    "Noah had prayed, “My Lord! Do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.",
    "For if You spare ˹any of˺ them, they will certainly mislead Your servants, and give birth only to ˹wicked˺ sinners, staunch disbelievers.",
    "My Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house in faith, and ˹all˺ believing men and women. And increase the wrongdoers only in destruction.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened ˹to the Quran,˺ and said ˹to their fellow jinn˺: ‘Indeed, we have heard a wondrous recitation.",
    "It leads to Right Guidance so we believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord ˹in worship˺.",
    "˹Now, we believe that˺ our Lord—Exalted is His Majesty—has neither taken a mate nor offspring,",
    "and that the foolish of us used to utter ˹outrageous˺ falsehoods about Allah.",
    "We certainly thought that humans and jinn would never speak lies about Allah.",
    "And some men used to seek refuge with some jinn—so they increased each other in wickedness.",
    "And those ˹humans˺ thought, just like you ˹jinn˺, that Allah would not resurrect anyone ˹for judgment˺.",
    "˹Earlier˺ we tried to reach heaven ˹for news˺, only to find it filled with stern guards and shooting stars.",
    "We used to take up positions there for eavesdropping, but whoever dares eavesdrop now will find a flare lying in wait for them.",
    "Now, we have no clue whether evil is intended for those on earth, or their Lord intends for them what is right.",
    "Among us are those who are righteous and those who are less so. We have been of different factions.",
    "˹Now,˺ we truly know that we cannot frustrate Allah on earth, nor can we escape from Him ˹into heaven˺.",
    "When we heard the guidance ˹of the Quran˺, we ˹readily˺ believed in it. For whoever believes in their Lord will have no fear of being denied ˹a reward˺ or wronged.",
    "And among us are those who have submitted ˹to Allah˺ and those who are deviant. So ˹as for˺ those who submitted, it is they who have attained Right Guidance.",
    "And as for the deviant, they will be fuel for Hell.’”",
    "Had the deniers followed the Right Way, We would have certainly granted them abundant rain to drink—",
    "as a test for them. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of their Lord will be admitted by Him into an overwhelming punishment.",
    "The places of worship are ˹only˺ for Allah, so do not invoke anyone besides Him.",
    "Yet when the servant of Allah stood up calling upon Him ˹alone˺, the pagans almost swarmed over him.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I call only upon my Lord, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺.”",
    "Say, “It is not in my power to harm or benefit you.”",
    "Say, “No one can protect me from Allah ˹if I were to disobey Him˺, nor can I find any refuge other than Him.",
    "˹My duty is˺ only to convey ˹the truth˺ from Allah and ˹deliver˺ His messages.” And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger will certainly be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever.",
    "Only when they see what they have been threatened with will they know who is weaker in helpers and inferior in manpower.",
    "Say, “I do not know if what you are promised is near or my Lord has set a distant time for it.",
    "˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone,",
    "except messengers of His choice. Then He appoints angel-guards before and behind them",
    "to ensure that the messengers fully deliver the messages of their Lord—though He ˹already˺ knows all about them, and keeps account of everything.”",
    "O you wrapped ˹in your clothes˺!",
    "Stand all night ˹in prayer˺ except a little—",
    "˹pray˺ half the night, or a little less,",
    "or a little more—and recite the Quran ˹properly˺ in a measured way.",
    "˹For˺ We will soon send upon you a weighty revelation.",
    "Indeed, worship in the night is more impactful and suitable for recitation.",
    "For during the day you are over-occupied ˹with worldly duties˺.",
    "˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly.",
    "˹He is the˺ Lord of the east and the west. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, so take Him ˹alone˺ as a Trustee of Affairs.",
    "Be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say, and depart from them courteously.",
    "And leave to Me the deniers—the people of luxury—and bear with them for a little while.",
    "˹For˺ We certainly have shackles, a ˹raging˺ Fire,",
    "choking food, and a painful punishment ˹in store for them˺",
    "on the Day the earth and mountains will shake ˹violently˺, and mountains will be ˹reduced to˺ dunes of shifting sand.",
    "Indeed, We have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you, just as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh.",
    "But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a stern grip.",
    "If you ˹pagans˺ persist in disbelief, then how will you guard yourselves against ˹the horrors of˺ a Day which will turn children’s hair grey?",
    "It will ˹even˺ cause the sky to split apart. His promise ˹of judgment˺ must be fulfilled.",
    "Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord.",
    "Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far better and more rewarding. And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "O you covered up ˹in your clothes˺!",
    "Arise and warn ˹all˺.",
    "Revere your Lord ˹alone˺.",
    "Purify your garments.",
    "˹Continue to˺ shun idols.",
    "Do not do a favour expecting more ˹in return˺.",
    "And persevere for ˹the sake of˺ your Lord.",
    "˹For˺ when the Trumpet will be sounded,",
    "that will ˹truly˺ be a difficult Day—",
    "far from easy for the disbelievers.",
    "And leave to me ˹O Prophet˺ the one I created all by Myself,",
    "and granted him abundant wealth,",
    "and children always by his side,",
    "and made life very easy for him.",
    "Yet he is hungry for more.",
    "But no! ˹For˺ he has been truly stubborn with Our revelations.",
    "I will make his fate unbearable,",
    "for he contemplated and determined ˹a degrading label for the Quran˺.",
    "May he be condemned! How evil was what he determined!",
    "May he be condemned even more! How evil was what he determined!",
    "Then he re-contemplated ˹in frustration˺,",
    "then frowned and scowled,",
    "then turned his back ˹on the truth˺ and acted arrogantly,",
    "saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but magic from the ancients.",
    "This is no more than the word of a man.”",
    "Soon I will burn him in Hell!",
    "And what will make you realize what Hell is?",
    "It does not let anyone live or die,",
    "scorching the skin.",
    "It is overseen by nineteen ˹keepers˺.",
    "We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have made their number only as a test for the disbelievers, so that the People of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith, and neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts, and so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this way Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description of Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity.",
    "But no! By the moon,",
    "and the night as it retreats,",
    "and the day as it breaks!",
    "Surely Hell is one of the mightiest catastrophes—",
    "a warning to humankind,",
    "to whichever of you chooses to take the lead or lag behind.",
    "Every soul will be detained for what it has done,",
    "except the people of the right,",
    "who will be in Gardens, asking one another",
    "about the wicked ˹who will then be asked˺:",
    "“What has landed you in Hell?”",
    "They will reply, “We were not of those who prayed,",
    "nor did we feed the poor.",
    "We used to indulge ˹in falsehood˺ along with others,",
    "and deny the Day of Judgment,",
    "until the inevitable came to us.”",
    "So the pleas of intercessors will be of no benefit to them.",
    "Now, what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the reminder,",
    "as if they were spooked zebras",
    "fleeing from a lion?",
    "In fact, each one of them wishes to be given a ˹personal˺ letter ˹from Allah˺ for all ˹to read˺.",
    "But no! In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter.",
    "Enough! Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder.",
    "So let whoever wills be mindful of it.",
    "But they cannot do so unless Allah wills. He ˹alone˺ is worthy to be feared and entitled to forgive.",
    "I do swear by the Day of Judgment!",
    "And I do swear by the self-reproaching soul!",
    "Do people think We cannot reassemble their bones?",
    "Yes ˹indeed˺! We are ˹most˺ capable of restoring ˹even˺ their very fingertips.",
    "Still people want to deny what is yet to come,",
    "asking ˹mockingly˺, “When is this Day of Judgment?”",
    "But when the sight is stunned,",
    "and the moon is dimmed,",
    "and the sun and the moon are brought together,",
    "on that Day one will cry, “Where is the escape?”",
    "But no! There will be no refuge.",
    "On that Day all will end up before your Lord.",
    "All will then be informed of what they have sent forth and left behind.",
    "In fact, people will testify against their own souls,",
    "despite the excuses they come up with.",
    "Do not rush your tongue trying to memorize ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran.",
    "It is certainly upon Us to ˹make you˺ memorize and recite it.",
    "So once We have recited a revelation ˹through Gabriel˺, follow its recitation ˹closely˺.",
    "Then it is surely upon Us to make it clear ˹to you˺.",
    "But no! In fact, you love this fleeting world,",
    "and neglect the Hereafter.",
    "On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright,",
    "looking at their Lord.",
    "And ˹other˺ faces will be gloomy,",
    "anticipating something devastating to befall them.",
    "But no! ˹Beware of the day˺ when the soul reaches the collar bone ˹as it leaves˺,",
    "and it will be said, “Is there any healer ˹who can save this life˺?”",
    "And the dying person realizes it is ˹their˺ time to depart,",
    "and ˹then˺ their feet are tied together ˹in a shroud˺.",
    "On that day they will be driven to your Lord ˹alone˺.",
    "This denier neither believed nor prayed,",
    "but persisted in denial and turned away,",
    "then went to their own people, walking boastfully.",
    "Woe to you, and more woe!",
    "Again, woe to you, and even more woe!",
    "Do people think they will be left without purpose?",
    "Were they not ˹once˺ a sperm-drop emitted?",
    "Then they became a clinging clot, then He developed and perfected their form,",
    "producing from it both sexes, male and female.",
    "Is such ˹a Creator˺ unable to bring the dead back to life?",
    "Is there not a period of time when each human is nothing yet worth mentioning?",
    "˹For˺ indeed, We ˹alone˺ created humans from a drop of mixed fluids, ˹in order˺ to test them, so We made them hear and see.",
    "We already showed them the Way, whether they ˹choose to˺ be grateful or ungrateful.",
    "Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing Fire.",
    "Indeed, the virtuous will have a drink ˹of pure wine˺—flavoured with camphor—",
    "˹from˺ a spring where Allah’s servants will drink, flowing at their will.",
    "They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of sweeping horror,",
    "and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor, the orphan, and the captive,",
    "˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only for the sake of Allah, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you.",
    "We fear from our Lord a horribly distressful Day.”",
    "So Allah will deliver them from the horror of that Day, and grant them radiance and joy,",
    "and reward them for their perseverance with a Garden ˹in Paradise˺ and ˹garments of˺ silk.",
    "There they will be reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches, never seeing scorching heat or bitter cold.",
    "The Garden’s shade will be right above them, and its fruit will be made very easy to reach.",
    "They will be waited on with silver vessels and cups of crystal—",
    "crystalline silver, filled precisely as desired.",
    "And they will be given a drink ˹of pure wine˺ flavoured with ginger",
    "from a spring there, called Salsabîl.",
    "They will be waited on by eternal youths. If you saw them, you would think they were scattered pearls.",
    "And if you looked around, you would see ˹indescribable˺ bliss and a vast kingdom.",
    "The virtuous will be ˹dressed˺ in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.",
    "˹And they will be told,˺ “All this is surely a reward for you. Your striving has been appreciated.”",
    "Indeed, it is We Who have revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ in stages.",
    "So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not yield to any evildoer or ˹staunch˺ disbeliever from among them.",
    "˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening,",
    "and prostrate before Him during part of the night, and glorify Him long at night. ",
    "Surely those ˹pagans˺ love this fleeting world, ˹totally˺ neglecting a weighty Day ahead of them.",
    "It is We Who created them and perfected their ˹physical˺ form. But if We will, We can easily replace them with others.",
    "Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord.",
    "But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "He admits whoever He wills into His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment.",
    "By those ˹winds˺ sent forth successively,",
    "and those blowing violently,",
    "and those scattering ˹rainclouds˺ widely!",
    "And ˹by˺ those ˹angels˺ fully distinguishing ˹truth from falsehood˺,",
    "and those delivering revelation,",
    "ending excuses and giving warnings.",
    "Surely, what you are promised will come to pass.",
    "So when the stars are put out,",
    "and the sky is torn apart,",
    "and the mountains are blown away,",
    "and the messengers’ time ˹to testify˺ comes up—",
    "for which Day has all this been set?",
    "For the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision!",
    "And what will make you realize what the Day of Decision is?",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "Did We not destroy earlier disbelievers?",
    "And We will make the later disbelievers follow them.",
    "This is how We deal with the wicked.",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "Did We not create you from a humble fluid,",
    "placing it in a secure place",
    "until an appointed time?",
    "We ˹perfectly˺ ordained ˹its development˺. How excellent are We in doing so!",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "Have We not made the earth a lodging",
    "for the living and the dead,",
    "and placed upon it towering, firm mountains, and given you fresh water to drink?",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "˹The disbelievers will be told,˺ “Proceed into that ˹Fire˺ which you used to deny!",
    "Proceed into the shade ˹of smoke˺ which rises in three columns,",
    "providing neither coolness nor shelter from the flames.",
    "Indeed, it hurls sparks ˹as big˺ as huge castles,",
    "and ˹as dark˺ as black camels.”",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "On that Day they will not ˹be in a position to˺ speak,",
    "nor will they be permitted to offer excuses.",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "˹They will be told by Allah,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision: We have gathered you along with earlier disbelievers ˹for punishment˺.",
    "So if you have a scheme ˹to save yourselves˺, then use it against Me.”",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "Indeed, the righteous will be amid ˹cool˺ shade and springs",
    "and any fruit they desire.",
    "˹They will be told,˺ “Eat and drink happily for what you used to do.”",
    "Surely this is how We reward the good-doers.",
    "˹But˺ woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "“Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, ˹for˺ you are truly wicked.”",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "When it is said to them, “Bow down ˹before Allah,” they do not bow.",
    "Woe on that Day to the deniers!",
    "So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?"
