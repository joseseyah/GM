    "The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it?",
    "We would surely be fabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.”",
    "The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, “If you follow Shu’aib, you will surely be losers!”",
    "Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
    "Those who rejected Shu’aib were ˹wiped out˺ as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu’aib were the true losers.",
    "He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?”",
    "Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its ˹disbelieving˺ people with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled.",
    "Then We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and argued ˹falsely˺, “Our forefathers ˹too˺ had been visited by adversity and prosperity.” So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.",
    "Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit.",
    "Did the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by night while they were asleep?",
    "Or did they feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they were at play?",
    "Did they feel secure against Allah’s planning? None would feel secure from Allah’s planning except the losers.",
    "Is it not clear to those who take over the land after ˹the destruction of˺ its former residents that—if We will—We can punish them ˹too˺ for their sins and seal their hearts so they will not hear ˹the truth˺?",
    "We have narrated to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of those societies. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still they would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.",
    "We did not find most of them true to their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.",
    "Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the corruptors!",
    "And Moses said, “O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,",
    "obliged to say nothing about Allah except the truth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with me.”",
    "Pharaoh said, “If you have come with a sign, then bring it if what you say is true.”",
    "So Moses threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.",
    "Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.",
    "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, “He is indeed a skilled magician,",
    "who seeks to drive you from your land.” ˹So Pharaoh asked,˺ “What do you propose?”",
    "They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and send mobilizers to all cities",
    "to bring you every clever magician.”",
    "The magicians came to Pharaoh, saying, “Shall we receive a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?”",
    "He replied, “Yes, and you will certainly be among those closest to me.”",
    "They asked, “O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?”",
    "Moses said, “You first.” So when they did, they deceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of magic.",
    "Then We inspired Moses, “Throw down your staff,” and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion!",
    "So the truth prevailed and their illusions failed.",
    "So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.",
    "And the magicians fell down, prostrating.",
    "They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—",
    "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”",
    "Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see.",
    "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”",
    "They responded, “Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.",
    "Your rage towards us is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting ˹to You˺.” ",
    "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their women. We will completely dominate them.”",
    "Moses reassured his people, “Seek Allah’s help and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. He grants it to whoever He chooses of His servants. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.”",
    "They complained, “We have always been oppressed—before and after you came to us ˹with the message˺.” He replied, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.”",
    "Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh’s people with famine and shortage of crops so they might come back ˹to their senses˺.",
    "In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him. Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know.",
    "They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will never believe in you.”",
    "So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood—all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.",
    "When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.”",
    "But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate—they broke their promise.",
    "So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them in the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them.",
    "And ˹so˺ We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.",
    "We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly!",
    "What they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain.”",
    "He added, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has honoured you above the others?”",
    "And ˹remember˺ when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.",
    "We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten—completing his Lord’s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors.”",
    "When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.”",
    "Allah said, “O Moses! I have ˹already˺ elevated you above all others by My messages and speech. So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.”",
    "We wrote for him on the Tablets ˹the fundamentals˺ of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. ˹We commanded,˺ “Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it. I will soon show ˹all of˺ you the home of the rebellious.",
    "I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.",
    "The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?”",
    "In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.",
    "Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.”",
    "When Moses returned to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me and˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”",
    "Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”",
    "Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with wrath from their Lord as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.",
    "But those who commit evil, then repent and become ˹true˺ believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.",
    "When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.",
    "Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake, he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.",
    "Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.",
    "“˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To Him ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
    "There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.",
    "We divided them into twelve tribes—each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” They ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.",
    "And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.”",
    "But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.",
    "Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath. During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.",
    "When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”",
    "When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.",
    "But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!” ",
    "And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord declared that He would send against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day of Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
    "Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",
    "As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.",
    "And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them. ˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”",
    "And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” ˹He cautioned,˺ “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’",
    "Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺ and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”",
    "This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
    "And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.",
    "If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺ pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect.",
    "What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own souls.",
    "Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the ˹true˺ losers.",
    "Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless.",
    "Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do.",
    "And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly.",
    "As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.",
    "I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.",
    "Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning.",
    "Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?",
    "Whoever Allah allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.",
    "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”",
    "Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”",
    "He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”",
    "But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
    "Do they associate ˹with Allah˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create anything, but are in fact created;",
    "which cannot help them, or even help themselves?",
    "And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent.",
    "Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true!",
    "Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!",
    "“Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He ˹alone˺ protects the righteous.",
    "But those ˹false gods˺ you call besides Him can neither help you nor even themselves.”",
    "If you ˹idolaters˺ call them to guidance, they cannot hear. And you ˹O Prophet˺ may see them facing towards you, but they cannot see.",
    "Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly.",
    "If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly.",
    "But the devils persistently plunge their ˹human˺ associates deeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.",
    "If you ˹O Prophet˺ do not bring them a sign ˹which they demanded˺, they ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight from your Lord—a guide and a mercy for those who believe.”",
    "When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.",
    "Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a moderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of the heedless.",
    "Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate.",
    "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.”",
    "The ˹true˺ believers are only those whose hearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, whose faith increases when His revelations are recited to them, and who put their trust in their Lord.",
    "˹They are˺ those who establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them.",
    "It is they who are the true believers. They will have elevated ranks, forgiveness, and an honourable provision from their Lord.",
    "Similarly, when your Lord brought you ˹O Prophet˺ out of your home for a just cause, a group of believers was totally against it.",
    "They disputed with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open.",
    "˹Remember, O  believers,˺ when Allah promised ˹to give˺ you the upper hand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party. But it was Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the disbelievers;",
    "to firmly establish the truth and wipe out falsehood—even to the dismay of the wicked.",
    "˹Remember˺ when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”",
    "And Allah made this a sign of victory and reassurance to your hearts. Victory comes only from Allah. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "˹Remember˺ when He caused drowsiness to overcome you, giving you serenity. And He sent down rain from the sky to purify you, free you from Satan’s whispers, strengthen your hearts, and make ˹your˺ steps firm.",
    "˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”",
    "This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah and His Messenger, then ˹know that˺ Allah is surely severe in punishment.",
    "That ˹worldly punishment˺ is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers will suffer the torment of the Fire.",
    "O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them.",
    "And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!",
    "It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so. Nor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the disbelievers˺, but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "As such, Allah frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.",
    "If you ˹Meccans˺ sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you cease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And your forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you whatsoever. For Allah is certainly with the believers.",
    "O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear ˹his call˺.",
    "Do not be like those who say, “We hear,” but in fact they are not listening.",
    "Indeed, the worst of all beings in the sight of Allah are the ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb, who do not understand.",
    "Had Allah found any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly.",
    "O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered.",
    "Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is severe in punishment.",
    "Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land, constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful.",
    "O believers! Do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly.",
    "And know that your wealth and your children are only a test and that with Allah is a great reward.",
    "O believers! If you are mindful of Allah, He will grant you a decisive authority, absolve you of your sins, and forgive you. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.",
    "And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when the disbelievers conspired to capture, kill, or exile you. They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is the best of planners.",
    "Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they challenge ˹you˺, “We have already heard ˹the recitation˺. If we wanted, we could have easily produced something similar. This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”",
    "And ˹remember˺ when they prayed, “O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones upon us from the sky or overcome us with a painful punishment.”",
    "But Allah would never punish them while you ˹O Prophet˺ were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they prayed for forgiveness.",
    "And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from the Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right to guardianship except those mindful ˹of Allah˺, but most pagans do not know.",
    "Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief.",
    "Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell,",
    "so Allah may separate the evil from the good. He will pile up the evil ones all together and then cast them into Hell. They are the ˹true˺ losers.",
    "Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them.",
    "Fight against them until there is no more persecution—and ˹your˺ devotion will be entirely to Allah. But if they desist, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
    "And if they do not comply, then know that Allah is your Protector. What an excellent Protector, and what an excellent Helper!"
