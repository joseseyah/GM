    "<h2>The Stubbornness of the Disbelievers</h2><p>Allah describes how stubborn the disbelievers were in their disbelief when they said:</p><p>لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا</p><p>(Why are not the angels sent down to us,) meaning, `so that we may see them with our own eyes and they may tell us that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah.' This is like when they said:</p><p>أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً</p><p>(or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face) (17:92). Hence they also said:</p><p>الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَى</p><p>(or why do we not see our Lord) Allah said:</p><p>رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْا عُتُوّاً</p><p>(Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride.) And Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...) (6:111)</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals that day. And they will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") means, when they do see the angels, it will not be a good day for them, for on that day there will be no good news for them. This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, \"Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke.\" It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ</p><p>(And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs...\") (8:50)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ</p><p>(And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands.) that is, to beat them:</p><p>أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p><p>((saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject His Ayat with disrespect!\") (6: 93) Hence in this Ayah Allah says:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals) This is in contrast to the state of the believers when death approaches them, for they are given glad tidings of joy and delight. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah,\" and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the good news of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have what your souls desire, and therein you shall have what you ask for. Entertainment from, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): \"Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry.\" Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news) vrefers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(And they (angels) will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") The angels will say to the disbelievers: `success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition, hence the word is used in the phrase \"Hajara Al-Qadi `Ala Fulan\" (or, \"The judge prohibited so and so.\") when he forbids him to dispose of his wealth in cases of bankruptcy, folly, being underage, etc. The name of Al-Hijr (the low semicircular wall near the Ka`bah) is also derived from this root, because it prevents people from Tawaf inside it, since they have to go behind it. The mind is also called Al-Hijr, because it prevents a person from indulging in things that do not befit him. In conclusion, the pronoun in the phrase.</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ</p><p>(And they will say) refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators.</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels) means, they will seek refuge from the angels. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say:</p><p>حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(\"Hijran Mahjura.\") Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.</p><p>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</p><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did,) This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari`ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted. Allah says:</p><p>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Abu Ishaq, from Al-Harith that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on Allah's saying:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) \"The rays of the sun when they pass through a small aperture.\" A similar view was also narrated through a different chain of narrators from `Ali, and something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This refers to the rays coming through a small window, and if anyone tries to grasp them, he cannot.\" Abu Al-Ahwas narrated from Abu Ishaq from Al-Harith that `Ali said: \"Haba' refers to the dust raised by animals. \" A similar view was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak, and this was also said by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam.</p><p>هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) Qatadah said: \"Have you not seen dry trees when they are blown by the wind This refers to those leaves.\" It was narrated that Ya`la bin `Ubayd said: \"Ashes or dust when it is stirred up by the wind.\" In conclusion, all of these views are pointing out that the deeds of the disbelievers will be like some worthless scattered thing, and will be of no avail to them whatsoever. As Allah says:</p><p>مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ</p><p>(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously) (14:18).</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى</p><p>(O you who believe! Do not render in vain your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,) until His saying:</p><p>لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ</p><p>(They are not able to do anything with what they have earned) (2:264).</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</p><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39).</p><h2>The Abode of the People of Paradise</h2><p>Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ</p><p>(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful) (59:20). That is because the people of Paradise will ascend to lofty degrees and secure dwellings, so they will be in a place of safety, beauty and goodness,</p><p>خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا حَسُنَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Abiding therein -- excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) (25:76) The people of Hell will go down to the lowest levels and continual regret, with all kinds of punishments and torments.</p><p>إِنَّهَا سَآءَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in.)(25:66) means, how evil a dwelling place to look at, and how evil an abode in which to stay. Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, in return for what they have done of acceptable deeds, they will attain what they will attain and reach the status they will reach, in contrast to the people of Hell, who will not have even one deed to their credit that would qualify them to enter Paradise and be saved from the Fire. Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Allah will finish the Judgement halfway through the Day, and the people of Paradise will take their mid day rest in Paradise and the people of Hell in Hell. Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) `Ikrimah said, \"I know the time when the people of Paradise will enter Paradise and the people of Hell will enter Hell. It is the time which in this world is the time when the late forenoon starts and people go back to their families to take a siesta. The people of Hell will go to Hell, but the people of Paradise will be taken to Paradise and will have their siesta in Paradise, and they will be fed the liver of a whale and they will all eat their fill. This is what Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.)</p>",

(6:111)</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals that day.

Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, in return for what they have done of acceptable deeds, they will attain what they will attain and reach the status they will reach, in contrast to the people of Hell, who will not have even one deed to their credit that would qualify them to enter Paradise and be saved from the Fire. Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Allah will finish the Judgement halfway through the Day, and the people of Paradise will take their mid day rest in Paradise and the people of Hell in Hell. Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) `Ikrimah said, \"I know the time when the people of Paradise will enter Paradise and the people of Hell will enter Hell. It is the time which in this world is the time when the late forenoon starts and people go back to their families to take a siesta. The people of Hell will go to Hell, but the people of Paradise will be taken to Paradise and will have their siesta in Paradise, and they will be fed the liver of a whale and they will all eat their fill. This is what Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Stubbornness of the Disbelievers</h2><p>Allah describes how stubborn the disbelievers were in their disbelief when they said:</p><p>لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا</p><p>(Why are not the angels sent down to us,) meaning, `so that we may see them with our own eyes and they may tell us that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah.' This is like when they said:</p><p>أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً</p><p>(or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face) (17:92). Hence they also said:</p><p>الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَى</p><p>(or why do we not see our Lord) Allah said:</p><p>رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ اسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْا عُتُوّاً</p><p>(Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride.) And Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...) (6:111)</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals that day. And they will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") means, when they do see the angels, it will not be a good day for them, for on that day there will be no good news for them. This is also confirmed at the time when they are dying, when the angels bring them the tidings of Hell and the wrath of the Compeller, and when the disbeliever's soul is being taken out, the angels say to it, \"Come out, O evil soul from an evil body, come out to fierce hot wind and boiling water, and the shadow of black smoke.\" It refuses to come out and it scatters throughout his body, so they beat him, as Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَـرَهُمْ</p><p>(And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve; they smite their faces and their backs...\") (8:50)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الظَّـلِمُونَ فِى غَمَرَاتِ الْمَوْتِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ بَاسِطُواْ أَيْدِيهِمْ</p><p>(And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands.) that is, to beat them:</p><p>أَخْرِجُواْ أَنفُسَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ الْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَكُنتُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p><p>((saying): \"Deliver your souls! This day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject His Ayat with disrespect!\") (6: 93) Hence in this Ayah Allah says:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news will there be for the criminals) This is in contrast to the state of the believers when death approaches them, for they are given glad tidings of joy and delight. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah,\" and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the good news of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have what your souls desire, and therein you shall have what you ask for. Entertainment from, the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32) According to an authentic Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, the angels say to the believer's soul (at the time of death): \"Come out, O good soul in a good body, as you were dwelling in it. Come out to rest and pleasant fragrances and a Lord Who is not angry.\" Other scholars said that the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَى</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels -- no good news) vrefers to the Day of Resurrection. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. But there is no contradiction between these two views, because on both of these days -- the day of death and the Day of Resurrection -- the angels will appear to the believers and disbelievers, and they will give glad tidings of divine mercy and pleasure to the believers, while they will give the disbelievers news that will bring regret and sorrow, so there will be no glad tidings for the evildoers and criminals on that Day.</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(And they (angels) will say: \"Hijran Mahjura.\") The angels will say to the disbelievers: `success is forbidden to you this day.' The basic meaning of Al-Hijr is preventing or prohibition, hence the word is used in the phrase \"Hajara Al-Qadi `Ala Fulan\" (or, \"The judge prohibited so and so.\") when he forbids him to dispose of his wealth in cases of bankruptcy, folly, being underage, etc. The name of Al-Hijr (the low semicircular wall near the Ka`bah) is also derived from this root, because it prevents people from Tawaf inside it, since they have to go behind it. The mind is also called Al-Hijr, because it prevents a person from indulging in things that do not befit him. In conclusion, the pronoun in the phrase.</p><p>وَيَقُولُونَ</p><p>(And they will say) refers to the angels. This was the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Khusayf and others; it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said that this referred to the words of the idolators.</p><p>يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ</p><p>(On the Day they will see the angels) means, they will seek refuge from the angels. This is because when disaster and hardship struck, the Arabs would say:</p><p>حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(\"Hijran Mahjura.\") Although there is a point to what Ibn Jurayj said, from the context it is unlikely that this is what was meant, and the majority of scholars said something different.</p><p>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ</p><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did,) This refers to the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will bring mankind to account for their deeds, good and bad alike. Allah tells us that the deeds which these idolators thought would bring them salvation will be of no avail to them, because they were not in accordance with the Shari`ah or Laws of Allah, whether in terms of sincere intention or in terms of following the Laws set out by Allah. Every deed that is neither sincere nor in accordance with the Laws of Allah is futile, and the deeds of the disbelievers are either one or the other, or they may include both, in which case they are even less likely to be accepted. Allah says:</p><p>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Abu Ishaq, from Al-Harith that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on Allah's saying:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) \"The rays of the sun when they pass through a small aperture.\" A similar view was also narrated through a different chain of narrators from `Ali, and something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This refers to the rays coming through a small window, and if anyone tries to grasp them, he cannot.\" Abu Al-Ahwas narrated from Abu Ishaq from Al-Harith that `Ali said: \"Haba' refers to the dust raised by animals. \" A similar view was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak, and this was also said by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam.</p><p>هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(scattered floating particles of dust (Haba').) Qatadah said: \"Have you not seen dry trees when they are blown by the wind This refers to those leaves.\" It was narrated that Ya`la bin `Ubayd said: \"Ashes or dust when it is stirred up by the wind.\" In conclusion, all of these views are pointing out that the deeds of the disbelievers will be like some worthless scattered thing, and will be of no avail to them whatsoever. As Allah says:</p><p>مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ اشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ الرِّيحُ</p><p>(The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously) (14:18).</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى</p><p>(O you who believe! Do not render in vain your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,) until His saying:</p><p>لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ</p><p>(They are not able to do anything with what they have earned) (2:264).</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</p><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39).</p><h2>The Abode of the People of Paradise</h2><p>Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ</p><p>(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful) (59:20). That is because the people of Paradise will ascend to lofty degrees and secure dwellings, so they will be in a place of safety, beauty and goodness,</p><p>خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا حَسُنَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Abiding therein -- excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.)

Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all.

Do not render in vain your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury,) until His saying:</p><p>لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ</p><p>(They are not able to do anything with what they have earned) (2:264).</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</p><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39).</p><h2>The Abode of the People of Paradise</h2><p>Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَآئِزُونَ</p><p>(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful) (59:20). That is because the people of Paradise will ascend to lofty degrees and secure dwellings, so they will be in a place of safety, beauty and goodness,</p><p>خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا حَسُنَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Abiding therein -- excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) (25:76) The people of Hell will go down to the lowest levels and continual regret, with all kinds of punishments and torments.</p><p>إِنَّهَا سَآءَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in.)(25:66) means, how evil a dwelling place to look at, and how evil an abode in which to stay. Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) meaning, in return for what they have done of acceptable deeds, they will attain what they will attain and reach the status they will reach, in contrast to the people of Hell, who will not have even one deed to their credit that would qualify them to enter Paradise and be saved from the Fire. Allah points out the situation of the blessed in contrast to that of the doomed, who will not enjoy any goodness at all. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"Allah will finish the Judgement halfway through the Day, and the people of Paradise will take their mid day rest in Paradise and the people of Hell in Hell. Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) `Ikrimah said, \"I know the time when the people of Paradise will enter Paradise and the people of Hell will enter Hell. It is the time which in this world is the time when the late forenoon starts and people go back to their families to take a siesta. The people of Hell will go to Hell, but the people of Paradise will be taken to Paradise and will have their siesta in Paradise, and they will be fed the liver of a whale and they will all eat their fill. This is what Allah says:</p><p>أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً</p><p>(The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.)</p>",

Mujahid said, \"This is as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ</div><p>(Do they then wait for anything other than that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds and the angels)\" (2:210)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ</div><p>(The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty) of the Most Gracious,) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</div><p>(Whose is the kingdom this Day: It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistable!) (40:16) In the Sahih it says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَطْوِي السَّمَوَاتِ بِيَمِينِهِ، وَيَأْخُذُ الْأَرَضِينَ بِيَدِهِ الْأُخْرَى، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَنَا الْمَلِكُ أَنَا الدَّيَّانُ، أَيْنَ مُلُوكُ الْأَرْضِ؟ أَيْنَ الْجَبَّارُونَ؟ أَيْنَ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ؟»</div><p>(Allah, may He be exalted, will fold up the heavens in His Right Hand, and will take the earths in His other Hand, then He will say: \"I am the Sovereign, I am the Judge. Where are the kings of the earth Where are the tyrants Where are the arrogants\")</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ عَسِيراً</div><p>(and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers.) means it will be very difficult, because it will be the Day of justice and the decisive judgement, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ </div><p>(Truly, that Day will be a hard Day -- Far from easy for the disbelievers) (74:9-10). This is how the disbelievers will be on the Day of Resurrection. As for the believers, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ</div><p>(The greatest terror will not grieve them.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ الظَّـلِمُ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يلَيْتَنِى اتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ الرَّسُولِ سَبِيلاً </div><p>(And (remember) the Day when the wrongdoer will bite at his hands, he will say: \"O! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger.\") Here Allah tells us of the regret felt by the wrongdoer who rejected the path of the Messenger and what he brought from Allah of clear truth concerning which there is no doubt, and followed another path. When the Day of Resurrection comes, he will feel regret but his regret will avail him nothing, and he will bite on his hands in sorrow and grief. Whether this Ayah was revealed concerning `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`it or someone else among the doomed, it applies to every wrongdoer, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تُقَلَّبُ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ</div><p>(On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire) as mentioned in those two Ayat 33:66 Every wrongdoer will feel the ultimate regret on the Day of Resurrection, and will bite at his hands, saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ الظَّـلِمُ عَلَى يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يلَيْتَنِى اتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ الرَّسُولِ سَبِيلاً - يوَيْلَتَا لَيْتَنِى لَمْ أَتَّخِذْ فُلاَناً خَلِيلاً </div><p>(O! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger. Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as an intimate friend!) meaning, the one among the propagators of misguidance who diverted him from true guidance and led him to follow the path of misguidance, whether this refers to Umayyah bin Khalaf or his brother Ubayy bin Khalaf, or to someone else.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ أَضَلَّنِى عَنِ الذِّكْرِ</div><p>(He indeed led me astray from the Reminder) means the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَنِى</div><p>(after it had come to me.) means, after it had reached me. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ الشَّيْطَـنُ لِلإِنْسَـنِ خَذُولاً</div><p>(And Shaytan is to man ever a deserter (in the hour of need). ) meaning, he leads him away from the truth and diverts him from it, and uses him for the purposes of falsehood and calls him to it.</p>",
    "<h2>The Messenger will complain against His Opponents</h2><p>Allah tells how His Messenger and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\" The idolators would not listen to the Qur'an, as Allah says:</p><p>وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَسْمَعُواْ لِهَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ وَالْغَوْاْ فِيهِ</p><p>(And those who disbelieve say: \"Listen not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the midst of it.\") (41:26). When he would recite Qur'an to them, they would talk nonsense or speak about something else, so that they would not hear it. This is a form of forsaking it and rejecting it, and not believing in it is the same as forsaking it, and not pondering its meanings and trying to understand it is the same as forsaking it, and not acting upon it and following its commandments and heeding its prohibitions is the same as forsaking it, and turning away from it in favor of poetry or other words or songs or idle talk or some other way is the same as forsaking it. We ask Allah, the Most Generous, the Bestower of bounty, the One Who is able to do what He wills, to keep us safe from doing that which earns His wrath and to use us to do that which will earn His pleasure of preserving and understanding His Book, following its commandments night and day in the manner which He loves and which pleases Him, for He is Generous and Kind.</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals.) means, `just as there is for you, O Muhammad, those people who scorned the Qur'an, so in all the previous nations did Allah make for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals, who called people to their misguidance and disbelief,' as Allah says:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نِبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً شَيَـطِينَ الإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ</p><p>(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies -- Shayatin among mankind and Jinn) as stated in these two Ayat. (6:112) Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَفَى بِرَبِّكَ هَادِياً وَنَصِيراً</p><p>(But sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.) meaning, for the one who follows His Messenger and believes in His Book, Allah will be his Guide and Helper in this world and the Hereafter. Allah says</p><p>هَادِياً وَنَصِيراً</p><p>(a Guide and Helper.) because the idolators used to try to prevent people from following the Qur'an lest anyone be guided by it. They wanted their way to prevail over the way of the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِىٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals.)</p>",

    "<h2>Frightening the Idolators of Quraysh</h2><p>Allah threatens the idolators who denied and opposed His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and He warns them of the punishment and painful torment He sent upon the previous nations who rejected their Messengers. Allah begins by mentioning Musa, upon him be peace, whom He sent along with his brother Harun as a helper -- i.e., as another Prophet who helped and supported him -- but Fir`awn and his chiefs denied them both:</p><p>دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا</p><p>(Allah destroyed them completely, and similar (awaits) the disbelievers) (47:10). And when the people of Nuh denied him, Allah destroyed them likewise, for whoever denies one Messenger denies all the Messengers, because there is no difference between one Messenger and another. If it had so happened that Allah had sent all His Messengers to them, they would have denied them all. Allah says:</p><p>وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ الرُّسُلَ</p><p>(And Nuh's people, when they denied the Messengers,) although Allah sent only Nuh to them, and he stayed among them for 950 years, calling them to Allah and warning them of His punishment,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ</p><p>(And none believed with him, except a few) (11:40). For this reason Allah drowned them all and left no one among the sons of Adam alive on earth apart from those who boarded the boat,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ ءَايَةً</p><p>(and We made them a sign for mankind.) meaning a lesson to be learned. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ</p><p>(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear may understand it) (69:11-12), which means: `We left for you ships that you ride upon to travel across the depths of the seas, so that you may remember the blessing of Allah towards you when He saved you from drowning, and made you the descendants of those who believed in Allah and followed His commandments.'</p><p>وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَأَصْحَـبَ الرَّسِّ</p><p>(And (also) `Ad and Thamud, and the Dwellers of Ar-Rass,) We have already discussed their story, which is referred to in more than one Surah, such as Surat Al-A`raf, and there is no need to repeat it here. As for the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, Ibn Jurayj narrated from Ibn `Abbas about the Dwellers of Ar-Rass that they were the people of one of the villages of Thamud. Ath-Thawri narrated from Abu Bukayr from `Ikrimah that Ar-Rass was a well where they buried (Rassu) their Prophet.</p><p>وَقُرُوناً بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ كَثِيراً</p><p>(and many generations in between. ) means nations, many more than have been mentioned here, whom We destroyed. Allah said:</p><p>وَكُلاًّ ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ</p><p>(And for each We put forward examples,) meaning, `We showed them the proof and gave them clear evidence,' as Qatadah said, \"They had no excuse.\"</p><p>وَكُلاًّ تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيراً</p><p>(and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin.) means, `We destroyed them completely.' This is like the Ayah,</p><p>وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ</p><p>(And how many generations (Qurun) have We destroyed after Nuh!) (17:17). \"Generations\" (Qurun) here refers to nations among mankind. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً ءَاخَرِينَ</p><p>(Then, after them, We created other generations (Qurun).) (23:42) Some defined a generation as being 120 years, or it was said that a generation was one hundred years, or eighty, or forty, etc. The most correct view is that a generation refers to nations who are one another's contemporaries, living at the same time. When they go and others succeed them, this is another generation, as it was recorded in the Two Sahihs:</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ،ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best of generations is my generation, then the one that follows it, then the one that follows that.)</p><p>وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السَّوْءِ</p><p>(And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained the evil rain.) refers to the town of the people of Lut, which was called Sodom, and the way in which Allah dealt with it, when He destroyed it by turning it upside down and by sending upon it the rain of stones of baked clay, as Allah says:</p><p>وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ</p><p>(And We rained on them a rain. And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned!)

(15:76),</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(They are both on an open highway, plain to see) (15:79).

    "<h2>Frightening the Idolators of Quraysh</h2><p>Allah threatens the idolators who denied and opposed His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and He warns them of the punishment and painful torment He sent upon the previous nations who rejected their Messengers. Allah begins by mentioning Musa, upon him be peace, whom He sent along with his brother Harun as a helper -- i.e., as another Prophet who helped and supported him -- but Fir`awn and his chiefs denied them both:</p><p>دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا</p><p>(Allah destroyed them completely, and similar (awaits) the disbelievers) (47:10). And when the people of Nuh denied him, Allah destroyed them likewise, for whoever denies one Messenger denies all the Messengers, because there is no difference between one Messenger and another. If it had so happened that Allah had sent all His Messengers to them, they would have denied them all. Allah says:</p><p>وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ الرُّسُلَ</p><p>(And Nuh's people, when they denied the Messengers,) although Allah sent only Nuh to them, and he stayed among them for 950 years, calling them to Allah and warning them of His punishment,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ</p><p>(And none believed with him, except a few) (11:40). For this reason Allah drowned them all and left no one among the sons of Adam alive on earth apart from those who boarded the boat,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ ءَايَةً</p><p>(and We made them a sign for mankind.) meaning a lesson to be learned.

(26:176),</p><p>وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ - وَبِالَّيْلِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Verily, you pass by them in the morning.

But they used not to expect any resurrection.) means, the disbelievers who passed by it did not learn any lesson, because they did not expect any resurrection, i.e., on the Day of Judgement.</p>",
    "<h2>Frightening the Idolators of Quraysh</h2><p>Allah threatens the idolators who denied and opposed His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ and He warns them of the punishment and painful torment He sent upon the previous nations who rejected their Messengers. Allah begins by mentioning Musa, upon him be peace, whom He sent along with his brother Harun as a helper -- i.e., as another Prophet who helped and supported him -- but Fir`awn and his chiefs denied them both:</p><p>دَمَّرَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ أَمْثَـلُهَا</p><p>(Allah destroyed them completely, and similar (awaits) the disbelievers) (47:10). And when the people of Nuh denied him, Allah destroyed them likewise, for whoever denies one Messenger denies all the Messengers, because there is no difference between one Messenger and another. If it had so happened that Allah had sent all His Messengers to them, they would have denied them all. Allah says:</p><p>وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ الرُّسُلَ</p><p>(And Nuh's people, when they denied the Messengers,) although Allah sent only Nuh to them, and he stayed among them for 950 years, calling them to Allah and warning them of His punishment,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَامَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ</p><p>(And none believed with him, except a few) (11:40). For this reason Allah drowned them all and left no one among the sons of Adam alive on earth apart from those who boarded the boat,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ ءَايَةً</p><p>(and We made them a sign for mankind.) meaning a lesson to be learned. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَا الْمَآءُ حَمَلْنَـكُمْ فِى الْجَارِيَةِ - لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً وَتَعِيَهَآ أُذُنٌ وَعِيَةٌ</p><p>(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the boat. That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear may understand it) (69:11-12), which means: `We left for you ships that you ride upon to travel across the depths of the seas, so that you may remember the blessing of Allah towards you when He saved you from drowning, and made you the descendants of those who believed in Allah and followed His commandments.'</p><p>وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَأَصْحَـبَ الرَّسِّ</p><p>(And (also) `Ad and Thamud, and the Dwellers of Ar-Rass,) We have already discussed their story, which is referred to in more than one Surah, such as Surat Al-A`raf, and there is no need to repeat it here. As for the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, Ibn Jurayj narrated from Ibn `Abbas about the Dwellers of Ar-Rass that they were the people of one of the villages of Thamud. Ath-Thawri narrated from Abu Bukayr from `Ikrimah that Ar-Rass was a well where they buried (Rassu) their Prophet.</p><p>وَقُرُوناً بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ كَثِيراً</p><p>(and many generations in between. ) means nations, many more than have been mentioned here, whom We destroyed. Allah said:</p><p>وَكُلاًّ ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ الاٌّمْثَالَ</p><p>(And for each We put forward examples,) meaning, `We showed them the proof and gave them clear evidence,' as Qatadah said, \"They had no excuse.\"</p><p>وَكُلاًّ تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيراً</p><p>(and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin.) means, `We destroyed them completely.' This is like the Ayah,</p><p>وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ</p><p>(And how many generations (Qurun) have We destroyed after Nuh!) (17:17). \"Generations\" (Qurun) here refers to nations among mankind. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً ءَاخَرِينَ</p><p>(Then, after them, We created other generations (Qurun).) (23:42) Some defined a generation as being 120 years, or it was said that a generation was one hundred years, or eighty, or forty, etc. The most correct view is that a generation refers to nations who are one another's contemporaries, living at the same time. When they go and others succeed them, this is another generation, as it was recorded in the Two Sahihs:</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ،ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best of generations is my generation, then the one that follows it, then the one that follows that.)</p><p>وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السَّوْءِ</p><p>(And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained the evil rain.) refers to the town of the people of Lut, which was called Sodom, and the way in which Allah dealt with it, when He destroyed it by turning it upside down and by sending upon it the rain of stones of baked clay, as Allah says:</p><p>وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ</p><p>(And We rained on them a rain. And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned!) (26:176),</p><p>وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ - وَبِالَّيْلِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Verily, you pass by them in the morning. And at night; will you not then reflect) (37:137-138),</p><p>وَإِنَّهَا لَبِسَبِيلٍ مُّقِيمٍ</p><p>(And verily, they were right on the highroad.) (15:76),</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمَا لَبِإِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(They are both on an open highway, plain to see) (15:79). Allah says:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَكُونُواْ يَرَوْنَهَا</p><p>(Did they not then see it) meaning, so that they might learn a lesson from what happened to its inhabitants of punishment for denying the Messenger and going against the commands of Allah.</p><p>بَلْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَرْجُونَ نُشُوراً</p><p>(Nay!

Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah...\") (7:158). In the Two Sahihs (it is reported that the Prophet said:)</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ إِلَى الْأَحْمَرِ وَالْأَسْوَد»</p><p>(I have been sent to the red and the black. ) And:</p><p>«وَكَانَ النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ خَاصَّةً، وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّة»</p><p>(...A Prophet would be sent to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.) Allah says:</p><p>فَلاَ تُطِعِ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَجَـهِدْهُمْ بِهِ</p><p>(So obey not the disbelievers, but strive hard against them with it.) meaning, with the Qur'an. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas.</p><p>جِهَاداً كَبيراً</p><p>(with the utmost endeavour.) This is like the Ayah,</p><p>يَأَيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ جَـهِدِ الْكُفَّـرَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ</p><p>(O Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites,) (9:73)</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ</p><p>(And it is He Who has let free the two seas, this is palatable and sweet, and that is salty and bitter;) means, He has created the two kinds of water, sweet and salty. The sweet water is like that in rivers, springs and wells, which is fresh, sweet, palatable water. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and of Ibn Jarir, and this is the meaning without a doubt, for nowhere in creation is there a sea which is fresh and sweet. Allah has told us about reality so that His servants may realize His blessings to them and give thanks to Him. The sweet water is that which flows amidst people. Allah has portioned it out among His creatures according to their needs; rivers and springs in every land, according to what they need for themselves and their lands.</p><p>وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ</p><p>(and that is salty and bitter;) meaning that it is salty, bitter and not easy to swallow. This is like the seas that are known in the east and the west, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits that lead to it, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and so on, all the seas that are stable and do not flow, but they swell and surge in the winter and when the winds are strong, and they have tides that ebb and flow. At the beginning of each month the tides ebb and flood, and when the month starts to wane they retreat until they go back to where they started. When the crescent of the following month appears, the tide begins to ebb again until the fourteenth of the month, then it decreases.

They do this with no evidence or proof; the only thing that led them to do this was their own whims and desires. So they take these idols as protectors and fight for their sake, and they oppose Allah and His Messenger and the believers for their sake. Similarly Allah says:</p><p>وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</p><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:</p><p>وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ - لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مٌّحْضَرُونَ</p><p>(And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped. They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them.) (36:74-75) meaning, the gods which they worshipped instead of Allah cannot help them.

    "<h2>The Ignorance of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah tells us how ignorant the idolators are; instead of worshipping Allah, they worship idols which do not possess the power either to harm or benefit.

Similarly Allah says:</p><p>وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</p><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:</p><p>وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ - لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مٌّحْضَرُونَ</p><p>(And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped.

    "<h2>The Ignorance of the Idolators</h2><p>Allah tells us how ignorant the idolators are; instead of worshipping Allah, they worship idols which do not possess the power either to harm or benefit. They do this with no evidence or proof; the only thing that led them to do this was their own whims and desires. So they take these idols as protectors and fight for their sake, and they oppose Allah and His Messenger and the believers for their sake. Similarly Allah says:</p><p>وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</p><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:</p><p>وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ - لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مٌّحْضَرُونَ</p><p>(And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped. They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them.) (36:74-75) meaning, the gods which they worshipped instead of Allah cannot help them. These ignorant people are troops for the idols and are ready to fight for their sake and protect their sanctuaries, but in the end the victory will be for Allah and His Messenger and the believers, in this world and the Hereafter.</p><p>وَكَانَ الْكَـفِرُ عَلَى رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً</p><p>(and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord. ) Mujahid said: \"He supports and helps the Shaytan in disobedience towards Allah.</p><h2>The Messenger brings Glad Tidings and Warnings</h2><p>Then Allah tells His Messenger:</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً</p><p>(And We have sent you only as a bearer of good news and a warner.) meaning, a bringer of good news to the believers, a warner to the disbelievers; bringing good news of Paradise to those who obey Allah, and bringing warnings of a dreadful punishment for those who go against the commandments of Allah.</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ</p><p>(Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this...\") `for conveying this message and this warning, I do not ask for any reward from your wealth; I am only doing this for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted.'</p><p>لِمَن شَآءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ</p><p>(To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight) (81:28).</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ أَن يَتَّخِذَ إِلَى رَبِّهِ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(save that whosoever wills, may take a path to his Lord.) means, a way and a methodology to be followed.</p><p>The Command to the Messenger to put his Trust in Allah, and someof His Qualities</p><p>Then Allah says:</p><p>وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْحَىِّ الَّذِى لاَ يَمُوتُ</p><p>(And put your trust in the Ever Living One Who dies not,) meaning, in all your affairs, put your trust in Allah, the Ever-Living Who never dies, the One Who</p><p>الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(is the First and the Last, the Most High and the Most Near.

Allah is the One in Whom you should put your trust and to Whom you should turn for refuge, He will be sufficient for you and will be your helper and supporter, and will cause you to prevail. As Allah says:</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ</p><p>(O Messenger!

So the Ayah means: be sincere in worshipping Him and putting your trust in Him. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً</p><p>(The Lord of the east and the west; there is no God but He.

It is known that there is no one who knows more about Allah than His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ, the absolute leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the Hereafter, who does not speak of his own desire, but conveys revelation revealed to him. What he says is true, and he is the leader whose decision counts; when there is a dispute, people are obliged to refer to him, and whatever is in accordance with his words and deeds is right, and whatever goes against them should be rejected no matter who says or does it.

As Allah says:</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ</p><p>(O Messenger! Proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind) (5:67).</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِهِ</p><p>(and glorify His praises,) means, combine praising Him with glorifying Him. Hence the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say:</p><p>«سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَا وَبِحَمْدِك»</p><p>(Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.) So the Ayah means: be sincere in worshipping Him and putting your trust in Him. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً</p><p>(The Lord of the east and the west; there is no God but He. So take Him as a Trustee.) (73:9)</p><p>فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(So worship Him and put your trust in Him) (11:123).</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـنُ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا</p><p>(Say: \"He is the Most Gracious, in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust.\") (67:29)</p><p>وَكَفَى بِهِ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً</p><p>(and sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His servants) means, by His perfect knowledge nothing is hidden from Him nor can anything be hidden from Him, not even a speck of dust's weight.</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ</p><p>(Who created the heavens and the earth...) means, He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, He is the Creator, Sustainer and Sovereign of all things, Who by His might and power created the seven heavens with their vast height and width, and the seven earths with their great depths and density.</p><p>فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</p><p>(in six Days. Then He rose over the Throne.) means, He is running all affairs and He decrees according to the truth, and He is the best of those who decide.</p><p>ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَى الْعَرْشِ الرَّحْمَـنُ فَاسْأَلْ بِهِ خَبِيراً</p><p>(Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne. The Most Gracious! Ask Him, as He is the All-Knower.) meaning, find out about Him from one who knows most about Him, and follow him and take him as your example. It is known that there is no one who knows more about Allah than His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ, the absolute leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the Hereafter, who does not speak of his own desire, but conveys revelation revealed to him. What he says is true, and he is the leader whose decision counts; when there is a dispute, people are obliged to refer to him, and whatever is in accordance with his words and deeds is right, and whatever goes against them should be rejected no matter who says or does it. Allah says:</p><p>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ</p><p>((And) if you differ in anything among yourselves...) (4:59).</p><p>وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p>(And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah) (42:10).</p><p>وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</p><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6: 115). meaning, He has spoken the truth and is fair and just in His commands and prohibitions. Allah says here:</p><p>فَاسْأَلْ بِهِ خَبِيراً</p><p>(Ask Him, as He is Al-Knower.)</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators</h2><p>Then Allah rebukes the idolators who prostrate to idols and rivals instead of Allah:</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اسْجُدُواْ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ قَالُواْ وَمَا الرَّحْمَـنُ</p><p>(And when it is said to them: \"Prostrate yourselves to Ar-Rahman!\" They say: \"And what is Ar-Rahman\") meaning: we do not know Ar-Rahman. They did not like to call Allah by His Name Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), as they objected on the day of (the treaty of) Al-Hudaybiyyah, when the Prophet told the scribe:</p><p>«اكْتُبْ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيم»</p><p>(Write: \"In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful).\") They said, \"We do not know Ar-Rahman or Ar-Rahim. Write what you used to write: `Bismika Allahumma (in Your Name, O Allah).\"' So Allah revealed the words:</p><p>قُلِ ادْعُواْ اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُواْ الرَّحْمَـنَ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءَ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Say: \"Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman, by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names) (17:110). meaning, He is Allah and He is the Most Gracious. And in this Ayah, Allah said:</p><p>وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ اسْجُدُواْ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ قَالُواْ وَمَا الرَّحْمَـنُ</p><p>(And when it is said to them: \"Prostrate yourselves to Ar-Rahman!\" They say: \"And what is the Ar-Rahman\") meaning: we do not know or approve of this Name.</p><p>أَنَسْجُدُ لِمَا تَأْمُرُنَا</p><p>(Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you command us) means, \"Just because you tell us to\"</p><p>وَزَادَهُمْ نُفُوراً</p><p>(And it increases in them only aversion.) As for the believers, they worship Allah Who is the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, and they attribute divinity to Him Alone and prostrate to Him. The scholars, agree that it is allowed and approved for the reader and the listener to prostrate when he reaches this mention of prostration in Surat Al-Furqan, and Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>Mentioning the Might and Power of Allah</h2><p>Here Allah glorifies Himself and praises the beauty He created in the heavens of Al-Buruj, the giant stars, according to the view of Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.

So whoever misses an act of worship during the night can make it up during the day, and whoever misses an act of worship during the day can make it up during the night. It was recorded in a Sahih Hadith:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَبْسُطُ يَدَهُ بِاللَّيْلِ لِيَتُوبَ مُسِيءُ النَّهَارِ، وَيَبْسُطُ يَدَهُ بِالنَّهَارِ لِيَتُوبَ مُسِيءُ اللَّيْل»</div><p>(Allah spreads forth His Hand at night for the one who has done evil during the day to repent, and He spreads forth His Hand during the day for the one who has done evil during the night to repent.)

    "<h2>Attributes of the Servants of the Most Gracious</h2><p>These are the attributes of the believing servants of Allah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الاٌّرْضِ هَوْناً</p><p>(those who walk on the earth Hawna,) meaning that they walk with dignity and humility, not with arrogance and pride. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلاَ تَمْشِ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَرَحًا</p><p>(And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance...) (17:37). So these people do not walk with conceit or arrogance or pride. This does not mean that they should walk like sick people, making a show of their humility, for the leader of the sons of Adam (the Prophet) used to walk as if he was coming downhill, and as if the earth were folded up beneath him. What is meant here by Hawn is serenity and dignity, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا أَتَيْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَلَا تَأْتُوهَا وَأَنْتُمْ تَسْعَونَ، وَأْتُوهَا وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّكِينَةُ فَمَا أَدْرَكْتُمْ مِنْهَا فَصَلُّوا، وَمَا فَاتَكُمْ فَأَتِمُّوا»</p><p>(When you come to the prayer, do not come rushing in haste.

This is what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did: the more ignorant the people, the more patient he would be. This is as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ اللَّغْوَ أَعْرَضُواْ عَنْهُ</p><p>(And when they hear Al-Laghw (evil or vain talk), they withdraw from it) (28:55).

Al-Hasan said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَهَا كَانَ غَرَاماً</p><p>(Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.) Everything that strikes the son of Adam, then disappears, does not constitute an inseparable, permanent punishment.

Al-Hasan said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَهَا كَانَ غَرَاماً</p><p>(Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.) Everything that strikes the son of Adam, then disappears, does not constitute an inseparable, permanent punishment. The inseparable, permanent punishment is that which lasts as long as heaven and earth. This was also the view of Sulayman At-Taymi.</p><p>إِنَّهَا سَآءَتْ مُسْتَقَرّاً وَمُقَاماً</p><p>(Evil indeed it is as an abode and as a place to rest in.) means, how evil it looks as a place to dwell and how evil it is as a place to rest.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَنفَقُواْ لَمْ يُسْرِفُواْ وَلَمْ يَقْتُرُواْ</p><p>(And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy...) They are not extravagant, spending more than they need, nor are they miserly towards their families, not spending enough on their needs. But they follow the best and fairest way. The best of matters are those which are moderate, neither one extreme nor the other.</p><p>وَكَانَ بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ قَوَاماً</p><p>(but are in a just balance between them.) This is like the Ayah,</p><p>وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ وَلاَ تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ الْبَسْطِ</p><p>(And let not your hand be tied to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach.)(17:29)</p>",

So these people do not walk with conceit or arrogance or pride. This does not mean that they should walk like sick people, making a show of their humility, for the leader of the sons of Adam (the Prophet) used to walk as if he was coming downhill, and as if the earth were folded up beneath him.

    "<h2>The Attributes of the Servants of the Most Gracious include avoiding Shirk, Murder and Zina</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah was asked which sin is the most serious\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»</p><p>(That you appoint a rival to Allah when He has created you.) He asked, \"Then what\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»</p><p>(That you kill your child for fear that he may eat with you.) He said, \"Then what\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تُزَانِي حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»</p><p>(That you commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) `Abdullah said, \"Then Allah revealed, confirming that:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</p><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah....)\" This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It was narrated that Sa`id bin Jubayr heard Ibn `Abbas saying that some of the people of Shirk killed a great deal and committed Zina a great deal, then they came to Muhammad ﷺ and said: \"What you are saying and calling people to is good, if only you would tell us that there is a way to expiate for what we have done.\" Then the Ayah:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</p><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah...) was revealed, as was the Ayah,</p><p>قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves!\") (39:53).</p><p>وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَاماً</p><p>(and whoever does this shall receive Athama.) It was recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: \"Athama is a valley in Hell.\" `Ikrimah also said that Athama refers to valleys in Hell in which those who commit unlawful sexual acts will be punished. This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid. As-Suddi said that Athama referred to punishment, which is closer to the apparent meaning of the Ayah. This interpretation makes it interchangeable with what comes next, the Ayah:</p><p>يُضَـعَفْ لَهُ الْعَذَابُ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ</p><p>(The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection,) i.e., repetitive and intensified.</p><p>وَيَخْلُدْ فِيهِ مُهَاناً</p><p>(and he will abide therein in disgrace;) scorned and humiliated.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلاً صَـلِحاً</p><p>(Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds;) means, those who do these evil deeds will be punished in the manner described,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ</p><p>(Except those who repent), that is; those who repent in this world to Allah from all of those deeds, for then Allah will accept their repentance. This is evidence that the repentance of the murderer is acceptable, and there is no contradiction between this and the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa':</p><p>وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِناً مُّتَعَمِّداً</p><p>(And whoever kills a believer intentionally) (4:93), because even though this was revealed in Al-Madinah, the meaning is general, and it could be interpreted to refer to one who does not repent, because this Ayah states that forgiveness is only for those who repent. Moreover Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives except that to whom He wills) (4:48). And in the authentic Sunnah, it is reported from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ that the repentance of a murderer is acceptable, as was stated in the story of the person who killed one hundred men and then repented, and Allah accepted his repentance, and other Hadiths.</p><p>فَأُوْلَـئِكَ يُبَدِّلُ اللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ حَسَنَـتٍ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)

A man will be brought and it will be said, \"Take away his major sins and ask him about his minor sins.\" So it will be said to him: \"On such and such a day, you did such and such, and on such and such a day, you did such and such.\" He will say, \"Yes, and he will not be able to deny anything.\" Then it will be said to him: \"For every evil deed you now have one good merit.\" He will say: \"O Lord, I did things that I do not see here.\") He (Abu Dharr) said: \"And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen.\" Muslim recorded it. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Jabir heard Makhul say, \"A very old man with sunken eyes came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, a man betrayed others and did immoral deeds, and there was no evil deed which he did not do. If (his sins) were to be distributed among the whole of mankind, they would all be doomed. Is there any repentance for him\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَأَسْلَمْتَ؟»</p><p>(Have you become Muslim) He said, \"As for me, I bear witness that there is no God but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«فَإِنَّ اللهَ غَافِرٌ لَكَ مَا كُنْتَ كَذَلِكَ، وَمُبَدِّلُ سَيِّئَاتِكَ حَسَنَات»</p><p>(Allah will forgive you for whatever you have done like that, and will replace your evil deeds with good merits.) The man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, even my betrayals and immoral actions\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«وَغَدَرَاتُكَ وَفَجَرَاتُك»</p><p>(Even your betrayals and immoral actions.) \"The man went away saying `La ilaha illallah' and `Allahu Akbar.\"' Allah tells us how His mercy extends to all His creatrues, and that whoever among them repents to Him, He will accept his repentance for any sin, great or small. Allah says:</p><p>وَمَن تَابَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَإِنَّهُ يَتُوبُ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَتاباً</p><p>(And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then indeed he has repented to Allah Mataba.) meaning, Allah will accept his repentance. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ يَجِدِ اللَّهَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:110).</p><p>أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants...)

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَعْرِفُ آخِرَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ خُرُوجًا مِنَ النَّارِ، وَآخِرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ دُخُولًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ، يُؤْتَى بِرَجُلٍ فَيَقُولُ: نَحُّوا عَنْهُ كِبَارَ ذُنُوبِهِ وَسَلُوهُ عَنْ صِغَارِهَا، قَالَ: فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: عَمِلْتَ يَوْمَ كَذَا، كَذَا وَكَذَا، وَعَمِلْتَ يَوْمَ كَذَا، كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَيَقُولُ: نَعَمْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يُنْكِرَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ شَيْئًا، فَيُقَالُ: فَإِنَّ لَكَ بِكُلِّ سَيِّئَةٍ حَسَنَةً، فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ عَمِلْتُ أَشْيَاءَ لَا أَرَاهَا ههُنَا»</p><p>(I know the last person who will be brought forth from Hell, and the last person who will enter Paradise. A man will be brought and it will be said, \"Take away his major sins and ask him about his minor sins.\" So it will be said to him: \"On such and such a day, you did such and such, and on such and such a day, you did such and such.\" He will say, \"Yes, and he will not be able to deny anything.\" Then it will be said to him: \"For every evil deed you now have one good merit.\" He will say: \"O Lord, I did things that I do not see here.\") He (Abu Dharr) said: \"And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen.\" Muslim recorded it. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Jabir heard Makhul say, \"A very old man with sunken eyes came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, a man betrayed others and did immoral deeds, and there was no evil deed which he did not do. If (his sins) were to be distributed among the whole of mankind, they would all be doomed. Is there any repentance for him\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَأَسْلَمْتَ؟»</p><p>(Have you become Muslim) He said, \"As for me, I bear witness that there is no God but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«فَإِنَّ اللهَ غَافِرٌ لَكَ مَا كُنْتَ كَذَلِكَ، وَمُبَدِّلُ سَيِّئَاتِكَ حَسَنَات»</p><p>(Allah will forgive you for whatever you have done like that, and will replace your evil deeds with good merits.)

This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ يَجِدِ اللَّهَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:110).</p><p>أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants...)

    "<h2>The Attributes of the Servants of the Most Gracious include avoiding Shirk, Murder and Zina</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah was asked which sin is the most serious\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»</p><p>(That you appoint a rival to Allah when He has created you.) He asked, \"Then what\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»</p><p>(That you kill your child for fear that he may eat with you.) He said, \"Then what\" He said:</p><p>«أَنْ تُزَانِي حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»</p><p>(That you commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) `Abdullah said, \"Then Allah revealed, confirming that:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</p><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah....)\" This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It was narrated that Sa`id bin Jubayr heard Ibn `Abbas saying that some of the people of Shirk killed a great deal and committed Zina a great deal, then they came to Muhammad ﷺ and said: \"What you are saying and calling people to is good, if only you would tell us that there is a way to expiate for what we have done.\" Then the Ayah:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ</p><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah...) was revealed, as was the Ayah,</p><p>قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves!\") (39:53).</p><p>وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذلِكَ يَلْقَ أَثَاماً</p><p>(and whoever does this shall receive Athama.) It was recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: \"Athama is a valley in Hell.\" `Ikrimah also said that Athama refers to valleys in Hell in which those who commit unlawful sexual acts will be punished. This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid. As-Suddi said that Athama referred to punishment, which is closer to the apparent meaning of the Ayah. This interpretation makes it interchangeable with what comes next, the Ayah:</p><p>يُضَـعَفْ لَهُ الْعَذَابُ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ</p><p>(The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection,) i.e., repetitive and intensified.</p><p>وَيَخْلُدْ فِيهِ مُهَاناً</p><p>(and he will abide therein in disgrace;) scorned and humiliated.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلاً صَـلِحاً</p><p>(Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds;) means, those who do these evil deeds will be punished in the manner described,</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ</p><p>(Except those who repent), that is; those who repent in this world to Allah from all of those deeds, for then Allah will accept their repentance.

    "<h2>More Attributes of the Servants of the Most Gracious</h2><p>These are further attributes of the servants of the Most Gracious. They do not bear witness to falsehood, including lies, immorality, disbelief, foul speech and false words. `Amr bin Qays said, this refers to gatherings of sexual immorality. It was said that the Ayah,</p><p>لاَ يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ</p><p>(And those who do not bear witness to falsehood,) refers to giving false testimony, which means lying deliberately to someone else. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Bakrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said three times:</p><p>«أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»</p><p>(Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins) We said, \"Of course, O Messenger of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْن»</p><p>(Associating others in worship with Allah and disobeying one's parents.) He was lying down, then he sat up and added:</p><p>«أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ، أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور»</p><p>(Beware false speech, and bearing witness to falsehood.) and he kept repeating it until we thought, would that he would stop.\" From the context it seems that what is meant by those who do not bear witness to falsehood is those who do not attend it or are not present when it happens. Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّواْ كِراماً</p><p>(and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.) They do not attend where falsehood occurs, and if it so happens that they pass by it, they do not let it contaminate them in the slightest. Allah says:</p><p>مَرُّواْ كِراماً</p><p>(they pass by it with dignity.)</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً</p><p>(And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.) This is also a characteristic of the believers,</p><p>الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p><p>(Those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord.) (8:2) Unlike the disbelievers. When they hear the Words of Allah, they are not affected by them or moved to change their ways. They persist in their disbelief, wrongdoing, ignorance and misguidance, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</p><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add doubt to their doubt) (9:124-125).</p><p>لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً</p><p>(fall not deaf and blind thereat.) means, unlike the disbelievers who, when they hear the Ayat of Allah, are not moved by them, but continue as they are, as if they did not hear them but are deaf and blind. His saying:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّـتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ</p><p>(And those who say: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes...\") means those who ask Allah to bring forth from their loins offspring who will obey Him and worship Him and not associate anything in worship with Him. Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means (offspring) who will strive to obey Allah and bring them joy in this world and the Hereafter.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Nufayr said: \"We sat with Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad one day, and a man passed by and said, \"How blessed are these two eyes which saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ! Would that we had seen what you saw and witnessed what you witnessed.\" Al-Miqdad got angry, and I was surprised, because the man had not said anything but good. Then he turned to him and said, \"What makes a man wish to be present when Allah had caused him to be absent, and he does not know how he would have behaved if he had been there By Allah, there are people who saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and Allah will throw them on their faces in Hell because they did not accept him or believe in him. Are you not grateful that Allah brought you forth from your mothers' wombs believing in your Lord and in what your Prophet brought, and that the test went to others and not to you Allah sent His Prophet during the most difficult time that any Prophet was ever sent, after a long period of ignorance, when the people could see no better religion than the worship of idols, and he brought the Criterion which distinguishes truth from falsehood and which would separate a father from his son. A man would realize that his father, son or brother was a disbeliever, and since Allah had opened his heart to Faith, he knew that if his relative died he would go to Hell, so he could not rest knowing that his loved one was in the Fire. This is what Allah referred to in the Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّـتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ</p><p>(And those who say: \"Our Lord!

Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Rabi` bin Anas said: \"Leaders who would be taken as examples in good.\" Others said: \"Guides who would call others to goodness.\" They wanted their worship to be connected to the worship of their children and offspring, and their guidance to go beyond themselves and benefit others. This would be more rewarding and a better end, as it was recorded in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّااِمنْ ثَلَاثٍ: وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَة»</p><p>(When a son of Adam dies, his deeds cease apart from three: a righteous child who will pray for him, knowledge from which others may benefit after him, or ongoing charity.)</p>",
    "<h2>More Attributes of the Servants of the Most Gracious</h2><p>These are further attributes of the servants of the Most Gracious. They do not bear witness to falsehood, including lies, immorality, disbelief, foul speech and false words. `Amr bin Qays said, this refers to gatherings of sexual immorality. It was said that the Ayah,</p><p>لاَ يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ</p><p>(And those who do not bear witness to falsehood,) refers to giving false testimony, which means lying deliberately to someone else. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Bakrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said three times:</p><p>«أَلَا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ؟»</p><p>(Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins) We said, \"Of course, O Messenger of Allah.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْن»</p><p>(Associating others in worship with Allah and disobeying one's parents.) He was lying down, then he sat up and added:</p><p>«أَلَا وَقَوْلُ الزُّورِ، أَلَا وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّور»</p><p>(Beware false speech, and bearing witness to falsehood.) and he kept repeating it until we thought, would that he would stop.\" From the context it seems that what is meant by those who do not bear witness to falsehood is those who do not attend it or are not present when it happens. Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا مَرُّواْ بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّواْ كِراماً</p><p>(and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.) They do not attend where falsehood occurs, and if it so happens that they pass by it, they do not let it contaminate them in the slightest. Allah says:</p><p>مَرُّواْ كِراماً</p><p>(they pass by it with dignity.)</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً</p><p>(And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.) This is also a characteristic of the believers,</p><p>الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p><p>(Those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord.) (8:2) Unlike the disbelievers. When they hear the Words of Allah, they are not affected by them or moved to change their ways. They persist in their disbelief, wrongdoing, ignorance and misguidance, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</p><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\" As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add doubt to their doubt) (9:124-125).</p><p>لَمْ يَخِرُّواْ عَلَيْهَا صُمّاً وَعُمْيَاناً</p><p>(fall not deaf and blind thereat.) means, unlike the disbelievers who, when they hear the Ayat of Allah, are not moved by them, but continue as they are, as if they did not hear them but are deaf and blind. His saying:</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا هَبْ لَنَا مِنْ أَزْوَجِنَا وَذُرِّيَّـتِنَا قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ</p><p>(And those who say: \"Our Lord!

Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ ءايَاتُ الْكِتَـبِ الْمُبِينِ</div><p>(These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكَ بَـخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ</div><p>(It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعًا أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together.

(43:54) They used to deny the Creator, may He be glorified, and they believed that they had no other lord than Fir`awn. When Musa said to them: \"I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds,\" Fir`awn said to him, \"Who is this who you are claiming is the Lord of Al-`Alamin other than me\" This is how it was interpreted by the scholars of the Salaf and the Imams of later generations. As-Suddi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يمُوسَى - قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِى أَعْطَى كُلَّ شَىءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَى </div><p>((Fir`awn) said: \"Who then, O Musa, is the Lord of you two\" He said: \"Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.\") (20:49-50) Those among the philosophers and others who claimed that this was a question about the nature or substance of Allah are mistaken. Fir`awn did not believe in the Creator in the first place, so he was in no position to ask about the nature of the Creator; he denied that the Creator existed at all, as is apparent from the meaning, even though proof and evidence had been established against him. When Fir`awn asked him about the Lord of Al-`Alamin, Musa said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ</div><p>((Musa) said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them...\") meaning, the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of all that, their God Who has no partner or associate. He is the One Who has created all things. He knows the higher realms and the heavenly bodies that are in them, both those that are stationary and those that move and shine brightly. He knows the lower realms and what is in them; the oceans, continents, mountains, trees, animals, plants and fruits. He knows what is in between the two realms; the winds, birds, and whatever is in the air. All of them are servants to Him, submitting and humbling themselves before Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ</div><p>(if you seek to be convinced with certainty. ) means, if you have believing hearts and clear insight. At this, Fir`awn turned to the chiefs and leaders of his state around him, and said to them -- mockingly expressing his disbelief in Musa:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ</div><p>(\"Do you not hear\") meaning, `are you not amazed by what this man is claiming -- that you have another god other than me' Musa said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ ءَابَآئِكُمُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!) meaning, the One Who created you and your forefathers, those who came before Fir`awn and his time.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>(He said) that is, Fir`awn said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ الَّذِى أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ</div><p>(Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!) meaning, there is no sense in his claim that there is any god other than me!'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>((Musa) said) -- to those in whose hearts Fir`awn had planted doubts:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!) `He is the One Who made the east the place where the heavenly bodies rise, and made the west the place where they set; this is the system to which He has subjugated all the heavenly bodies, stationary and moving. If what Fir`awn claims is true, that he is your lord and your god, then let him turn things around so that the heavenly bodies set in the east and rise in the west.' This is similar to the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ</div><p>(who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom When Ibrahim said: \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim said, \"Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east.

They said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ </div><p>(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\") meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يمُوسَى إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِىَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَى قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ</div><p>(They said: \"O Musa!

In Surat Al-A`raf Allah mentioned that they:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَحَرُواْ أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُو بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic) (7:116).

At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِى عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ</div><p>(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ</div><p>(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123).</p>",

    "<h2>The Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt</h2><p>After Musa stayed in Egypt for a long time, and the proof of Allah was established against Fir`awn and his chiefs, yet they were still arrogant and stubborn, then there was nothing left for them but punishment and vengeance. So Allah commanded Musa, peace be upon him, to take the Children of Israel out of Egypt by night, and take them wherever he would be commanded. So Musa, peace be upon him, did as he was commanded by his Lord, may He be glorified, and he led them forth after they had borrowed an abundance of jewelry from the people of Fir`awn. As more than one of the scholars of Tafsir have said, they left when the moon was rising, and Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said that the moon was eclipsed that night. And Allah knows best. Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf (Prophet Joseph), peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them. The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir`awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed. So he quickly sent his callers to all his cities, i.e., to mobilize his troops and bring them together, and he called out to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـؤُلآءِ</div><p>(Verily, these) meaning, the Children of Israel,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ</div><p>(indeed are but a small band. ) meaning, a small group.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ </div><p>(And verily, they have done what has enraged us.) means, `every time we have heard anything about them, it has upset us and made us angry.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَـذِرُونَ </div><p>(But we are a host all assembled, amply forewarned.) means, `we are constantly taking precautions lest they betray us.' Some of the Salaf read this with the meaning, \"we are constantly forewarned and forearmed.

Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf (Prophet Joseph), peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them. The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir`awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed.

According to another narration, also from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنَّكَ لَا تُخْزِينِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرين»</div><p>(Ibrahim will meet his father and will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when all creatures are resurrected.\" And Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\") He also recorded this in the Hadiths about the Prophets, upon them be peace, where the wording is:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَلْقَى إِبْرَاهِيمُ أَبَاهُ آزَرَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَعَلَى وَجْهِ آزَرَ قَتَرَةٌ وَغَبَرَةٌ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكَ لَا تَعْصِينِي، فَيَقُولُ أَبُوهُ: فَالْيَوْمَ لَا أَعْصِيكَ، فَيَقُولُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ وَعَدْتَنِي أَنْ لَا تُخْزِيَنِي يَوْمَ يُبْعَثُونَ، فَأَيُّ خِزْيٍ أَخْزَى مِنْ أَبِي الْأَبْعَدِ فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ انْظُرْ تَحْتَ رِجْلِكَ، فَيَنْظُرَ،فَإِذَا هُوَ بِذِيخٍ مُتَلَطِّخٍ، فَيُؤْخَذُ بِقَوَائِمِهِ فَيُلْقَى فِي النَّار»</div><p>(Ibrahim will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and there will be dust and darkness on Azar's face. Ibrahim will say to him, \"Did I not tell you not to disobey me\" His father will say to him: \"Today I will not disobey you.\" Ibrahim will say: \"O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state\" Allah will say to him: \"I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.\" Then it will be said: \"O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.\" So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.) This was also recorded by Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i in the Tafsir of his Sunan Al-Kubra.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلاَ بَنُونَ </div><p>(The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,) means, a man's wealth will not protect him from the punishment of Allah, even if he were to pay a ransom equivalent to an earthful of gold.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ بَنُونَ</div><p>(nor sons) means, `or if you were to pay a ransom of all the people on earth.' On that Day nothing will be of any avail except faith in Allah and sincere devotion to Him, and renunciation of Shirk and its people. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ </div><p>(Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart. ) meaning, free from any impurity or Shirk. Ibn Sirin said, \"The clean heart knows that Allah is true, that the Hour will undoubtedly come and that Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.\" Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, \"The clean heart is the sound heart.\" This is the heart of the believer, for the heart of the disbeliever and the hypocrite is sick. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ</div><p>(In their hearts is a disease) (2:10). Abu `Uthman An-Nisaburi said, \"It is the heart that is free from innovation and is content with the Sunnah.\"</p>",

    "<h2>Hud's preaching to His People `Ad</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Hud, when he called his people `Ad. His people used to live in the Ahqaf, curved sand-hills near Hadramawt, on the borders of Yemen. They lived after the time of Nuh, as Allah says in Surat Al-A`raf:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً</div><p>(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature) (7:69). This refers to the fact that they were physically strong and well-built, and very violent, and very tall; they had also been given a great deal of provisions, wealth, gardens, rivers, sons, crops and fruits. Yet despite all of that, they worshipped others besides Allah. So Allah sent Hud, one of their own, as a Messenger bringing them good news and delivering warnings. He called them to worship Allah alone, and he warned them of Allah's wrath and punishment if they were to go against him and treating him harshly. He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ </div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`. In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً</div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَعْبَثُونَ</div><p>(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ </div><p>(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ</div><p>(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ </div><p>(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ </div><p>(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.' Then Hud began reminding them of the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتَّقُواْ الَّذِى أَمَدَّكُمْ بِمَا تَعْلَمُونَ - أَمَدَّكُمْ بِأَنْعَـمٍ وَبَنِينَ - وَجَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(And have Taqwa of Him, Who has aided you with all that you know.

    "<h2>Hud's preaching to His People `Ad</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Hud, when he called his people `Ad. His people used to live in the Ahqaf, curved sand-hills near Hadramawt, on the borders of Yemen. They lived after the time of Nuh, as Allah says in Surat Al-A`raf:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً</div><p>(And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh and increased you amply in stature) (7:69). This refers to the fact that they were physically strong and well-built, and very violent, and very tall; they had also been given a great deal of provisions, wealth, gardens, rivers, sons, crops and fruits. Yet despite all of that, they worshipped others besides Allah. So Allah sent Hud, one of their own, as a Messenger bringing them good news and delivering warnings. He called them to worship Allah alone, and he warned them of Allah's wrath and punishment if they were to go against him and treating him harshly. He said to them, as Nuh had said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً تَعْبَثُونَ </div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah for your amusement) The scholars of Tafsir differed over the meaning of the word Ri`. In brief, they said that it refers to an elevated location at a well-known crossroads, where they would build a huge, dazzling, sturdy structure, this is why he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَبْنُونَ بِكُلِّ رِيعٍ ءَايَةً</div><p>(Do you build on every Ri` an Ayah) i.e., a well-known landmark,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَعْبَثُونَ</div><p>(for your amusement) meaning, `you are only doing that for the purpose of frivolity, not because you need it, but for fun and to show off your strength.' So their Prophet, peace be upon him, denounced them for doing that, because it was a waste of time and exhausted people's bodies for no purpose, and kept them busy with something that was of no benefit in this world or the next. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَتَّخِذُونَ مَصَانِعَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ </div><p>(And do you get for yourselves Masani` as if you will live therein forever) Mujahid said, \"This means fortresses built up strong and high and structures that are built to last.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَخْلُدُونَ</div><p>(as if you will live therein forever) means, `so that you may stay there forever, but that is not going to happen, because they will eventually cease to be, just as happened in the case of those who came before you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا بَطَشْتُمْ بَطَشْتُمْ جَبَّارِينَ </div><p>(And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants) They are described as being strong, violent and tyrannical.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ </div><p>(So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.) `Worship your Lord and obey your Messenger.'

Allah's saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold.

(69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ إِذَا جَآءَ لاَ يُؤَخَّرُ</div><p>(Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4).

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ دَمَّرْنَا الاٌّخَرِينَ وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَّطَرًا</div><p>(Then afterward We destroyed the others.

    "<h2>Shu`ayb and His Preaching to the Dwellers of Al-Aykah</h2><p>The companions of Al-Aykah were the people of Madyan, according to the most correct view. The Prophet of Allah Shu`ayb was one of them, but it does not say here, their brother Shu`ayb, because they called themselves by a name denoting their deification of Al-Aykah, which was a tree which they used to worship; it was said that it was a group of trees which were tangled, like trees in a thicket. For this reason, when Allah said that the companions of Al-Aykah denied the Messengers, He did not say, \"When their brother Shu`ayb said to them.\" Rather, He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ شُعَيْبٌ</div><p>(When Shu`ayb said to them) He is not described as belonging to them because of the meaning that was inherent in the name given to them even though he was their brother by blood.

    "<h2>The Response of Shu`ayb's People, Their Disbelief in Him and the coming of the Punishment upon Them</h2><p>Allah tells us how his people responded, and how it was like the response of Thamud to their Messenger -- for they were of like mind -- when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ</div><p>(You are only one of those bewitched!) meaning, `you are one of those who are affected by witchcraft.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!) means, `we think you are deliberately lying to us in what you say, and Allah has not sent you to us.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) Ad-Dahhak said: \"One side of the heavens.\" Qatadah said: \"A piece of the heaven.\" As-Suddi said: \"A punishment from heaven.\" This is like what the Quraysh said, as Allah tells us:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا </div><p>(And they say: \"We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) until:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً </div><p>(Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face.\") (17:90-92)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....\") (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّى أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\") means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ</div><p>(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them.

Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers.

    "<h2>The Response of Shu`ayb's People, Their Disbelief in Him and the coming of the Punishment upon Them</h2><p>Allah tells us how his people responded, and how it was like the response of Thamud to their Messenger -- for they were of like mind -- when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ</div><p>(You are only one of those bewitched!) meaning, `you are one of those who are affected by witchcraft.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنتَ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَإِن نَّظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!) means, `we think you are deliberately lying to us in what you say, and Allah has not sent you to us.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) Ad-Dahhak said: \"One side of the heavens.\" Qatadah said: \"A piece of the heaven.\" As-Suddi said: \"A punishment from heaven.\" This is like what the Quraysh said, as Allah tells us:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الاٌّرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا </div><p>(And they say: \"We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) until:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِىَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً </div><p>(Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face.\") (17:90-92)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah!

So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94).

They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94).

So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them.

Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يـشُعَيْبُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا</div><p>(\"We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.\") (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَؤُا إِنَّكَ لاّنتَ الْحَلِيمُ الرَّشِيدُ</div><p>(\"Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\") (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ</div><p>(And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: \"I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ</div><p>(so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.\"'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لأَيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ </div><p>(Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants.</p>",

Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ </div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذِكْرَى وَمَا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ </div><p>(And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.)

    "<h2>The Deniers will never believe until They see the Torment</h2><p>Allah says: `thus We caused denial, disbelief, rejection and stubbornness to enter the hearts of the sinners.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ</div><p>(They will not believe in it), i.e., the truth,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</div><p>(until they see the painful torment.) means, when their excuses will be of no avail, and the curse will be upon them, and theirs will be an evil abode.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً</div><p>(It shall come to them of a sudden,) means, the punishment of Allah will come upon them suddenly,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَفَيَقُولُواْ هَلْ نَحْنُ مُنظَرُونَ </div><p>(while they perceive it not.

When every sinner and evildoer sees his punishment, he will feel intense regret.

    "<h2>The Qur'an was brought down by Jibril, not Shaytan</h2><p>Allah tells us about His Book, which falsehood cannot approach from before or behind it, sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise. He states that it has been brought down by the trustworthy Ruh (i.e., Jibril) who is helped by Allah,</p><p>وَمَا تَنَزَّلَتْ بِهِ الشَّيَـطِينُ</p><p>(And it is not the Shayatin who have brought it down.) Then He tells us that it could not be the case for three reasons that the Shayatin brought it down. One is that it would not suit them, i.e., they have no desire to do so and they do not want to, because their nature is to corrupt and misguide people, but this contains words enjoining what is right and forbidding what is evil, and light, guidance and mighty proofs. There is a big difference between this and the Shayatin, Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُمْ</p><p>(Neither would it suit them)</p><p>وَمَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ</p><p>(nor are they able.) meaning, even if they wanted to, they could not do it. Allah says:</p><p>لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانَ عَلَى جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَـشِعاً مُّتَصَدِّعاً مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah) (59:21). Then Allah explains that even if they wanted to and were able to bear it and convey it, they still would not be able to achieve that, because they were prevented from hearing the Qur'an when it was brought down, for the heavens were filled with guardians and shooting stars at the time when the Qur'an was being revealed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, so none of the Shayatin could hear even one letter of it, lest there be any confusion in the matter.

    "<h2>The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred</h2><p>Here Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them. Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:</p><p>فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),</p><p>لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَى وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُواْ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),</p><p>لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً</p><p>(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),</p><p>لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ</p><p>(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and</p><p>وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ</p><p>(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»</p><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,</p><p>«يَا صَبَاحَاه»</p><p>(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»</p><p>(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:</p><p>«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»</p><p>(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.)

    "<h2>The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred</h2><p>Here Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them.

Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:</p><p>فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.)

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»</p><p>(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, \"Yes.\" He said:</p><p>«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»</p><p>(Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, \"May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this\" Then Allah revealed:</p><p>تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ</p><p>(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: \"When the Ayah:</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up and said:</p><p>«يَا فَاطِمَةُ ابْنَةُ مُحَمَّدٍ، يَا صَفِيَّةُ ابْنَةُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا سَلُونِي مِنْ مَالِي مَا شِئْتُم»</p><p>(O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: \"When the Ayah:</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:</p><p>«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاه»</p><p>(O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:</p><p>وَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>وَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا</p><p>(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(Who sees you when you stand up.) means, \"To pray.\" `Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(Who sees you when you stand up.) \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ</p><p>(Who sees you) \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"</p><p>وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى السَّـجِدِينَ</p><p>(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.)

He hears all that His servants say and He knows all their movements, as He says:</p><p>وَمَا تَكُونُ فِى شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْءَانٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُودًا إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you do any deed, but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it) (10:61).</p>",
    "<h2>The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred</h2><p>Here Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them. Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:</p><p>فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.)

(19:97),</p><p>لاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ</p><p>(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and</p><p>وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ</p><p>(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»</p><p>(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.)

Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,</p><p>«يَا صَبَاحَاه»</p><p>(O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَا بَنِي عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟»</p><p>(O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy!

And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:</p><p>وَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'</p><p>الَّذِى يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you.

    "<h2>The Command to warn His Tribe of near Kindred</h2><p>Here Allah commands (His Prophet ) to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate, and tells him that whoever associates others in worship with Him, He will punish them. Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:</p><p>فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّى بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\") This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ ءَابَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَـفِلُونَ</p><p>(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.)

    "<h2>Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators</h2><p>Here Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</p><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><p>يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</p><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</p><p>(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»</p><p>(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)</p><h2>Refutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet</h2><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ</p><p>(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him.

The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.</p><p>وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</p><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:</p><p>«اهْجُهُم»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:</p><p>«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.)

    "<h2>Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators</h2><p>Here Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</p><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><p>يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</p><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</p><p>(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»</p><p>(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock.

The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)</p><h2>Refutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet</h2><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ</p><p>(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him.

Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ</p><p>(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger.

The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,</p><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:</p><p>«أَنْتُم»</p><p>((This means) you.)</p><p>وَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً</p><p>(and remember Allah much).

This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.</p><p>وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</p><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:</p><p>«اهْجُهُم»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:</p><p>«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»</p><p>(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)</p><p>وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.)

    "<h2>Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators</h2><p>Here Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</p><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><p>يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</p><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</p><p>(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»</p><p>(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth.

The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.)

So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.</p><p>وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</p><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.)

    "<h2>Refutation of the Fabrications of the Idolators</h2><p>Here Allah addresses those idolators who claimed that what was brought by the Messenger was not the truth but was merely something that he had made up by himself, or that it came to him in visions from the Jinn. Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</p><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><p>يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</p><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</p><p>(They are nothing.)

It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ</p><p>(Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,</p><p>هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَى مَن تَنَزَّلُ الشَّيَـطِينُ - تَنَزَّلُ عَلَى كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.</p><p>أَثِيمٍ</p><p>(Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.</p><p>يُلْقُونَ السَّمْعَ</p><p>(Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ لَيْسُوا بِشَيْء»</p><p>(They are nothing.) They said: \"O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةُ مِنَ الْحَقِّ يَخْطَفُهَا الْجِنِّيُّ فَيُقَرْقِرُهَا فِي أُذُنِ وَلِيِّهِ كَقَرْقَرَةِ الدَّجَاجِ، فَيَخْلِطُونَ مَعَهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ مِائَةِ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(That is a word of truth which the Jinn snatches, then he gabbles it like the clucking of a chicken into the ear of his friend, but he mixes it with more than one hundred lies.) Al-Bukhari also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«إِذَا قَضَى اللهُ الْأَمْرَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ضَرَبَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهَا خُضْعَانًا لِقَوْلِهِ، كَأَنَّهَا سِلْسِلَةٌ عَلَى صَفْوَانٍ، فَإِذَا فُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُوا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟ قَالُوا (لِلَّذِي قَالَ): الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ، فَيَسْمَعُهَا مُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ، وَمُسْتَرِقُو السَّمْعِ هَكَذَا بَعْضُهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ وَصَفَ سُفْيَانُ بِيَدِهِ، فَحَرَّفَهَا وَبَدَّدَ بَيْنَ أَصَابِعِهِ فَيَسْمَعُ الْكَلِمَةَ فَيُلْقِيهَا إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، ثُمَّ يُلْقِيهَا الْآخَرُ إِلَى مَنْ تَحْتَهُ، حَتَّى يُلْقِيَهَا عَلَى لِسَانِ السَّاحِرِ أَوِ الْكَاهِنِ، فَرُبَّمَا أَدْرَكَهُ الشِّهَابُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُلْقِيَهَا، وَرُبَّمَا أَلْقَاهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَهُ، فَيَكْذِبُ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَةٍ،فَيُقَالُ: أَلَيْسَ قَدْ قَالَ لَنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: كَذَا وَكَذَا؟ فَيُصَدَّقُ بِتِلْكَ الْكَلِمَةِ الَّتِي سُمِعَتْ مِنَ السَّمَاء»</p><p>(When Allah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His decree, a chain beating on a rock. And when the fear in their hearts subsides, they say: \"What is it that your Lord has said\" They say: \"The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer. The shooting star may strike the Jinn before he passes it on, or he may pass it on before he is struck, and he adds to it one hundred lies, thus it is said: \"Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen\" So they believe him because of that one thing which was heard from the heavens.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تَحَدَّثُ فِي الْعَنَانِ وَالْعَنَانُ: الْغَمَامُ بِالْأَمْرِ (يَكُونُ) فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَتَسْمَعُ الشَّيَاطِينُ الْكَلِمَةَ، فَتَقُرُّهَا فِي أُذُنِ الْكَاهِنِ كَمَا تُقَرُّ الْقَارُورَةُ، فَيَزِيدُونَ مَعَهَا مِائَةَ كَذْبَة»</p><p>(The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.)</p><h2>Refutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet</h2><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, \"Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other. Hence Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.)</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ</p><p>(See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: \"They indulge in every kind of nonsense.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They engage in every kind of verbal art.\" This was also the view of Mujahid and others.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(And that they say what they do not do. ) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, two men, one from among the Ansar and one from another tribe, were ridiculing one another in verse, and each one of them was supported by a group of his own people, who were the foolish ones, and Allah said:</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ - أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ - وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them. See you not that they speak about every subject in their poetry And that they say what they do not do.) What is meant here is that the Messenger , to whom this Qur'an was revealed, was not a soothsayer or a poet, because his situation was quite obviously different to theirs, as Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا عَلَّمْنَـهُ الشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِى لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْءَانٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him. This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) (36:69),</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ - وَمَا هُوَ بِقَوْلِ شَاعِرٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلاَ بِقَوْلِ كَاهِنٍ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That this is verily, the word of an honored Messenger. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of a soothsayer, little is that you remember! This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exits.) (69:40-43)</p><h2>The Exception of the Poets of Islam</h2><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Yazid bin `Abdullah bin Qusayt, that Abu Al-Hasan Salim Al-Barrad, the freed servant of Tamim Ad-Dari said: \"When the Ayah --</p><p>وَالشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ الْغَاوُونَ</p><p>(As for the poets, the erring ones follow them.) was revealed, Hassan bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin Rawahah and Ka`b bin Malik came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, weeping, and said: \"Allah knew when He revealed this Ayah that we are poets. The Prophet recited to them the Ayah,</p><p>إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(Except those who believe and do righteous deeds,) and said:</p><p>«أَنْتُم»</p><p>((This means) you.)</p><p>وَذَكَرُواْ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً</p><p>(and remember Allah much). He said:</p><p>«أَنْتُم»</p><p>((This means) you.)</p><p>وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</p><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. ) He said:</p><p>«أَنْتُم»</p><p>((This means) you.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: \"O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.\" Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He began to praise the Messenger of Allah ﷺ where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.</p><p>وَانتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ</p><p>(and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hassan:</p><p>«اهْجُهُم»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse.) Or he said:</p><p>«َهاجِهِمْ وَجِبْرِيلُ مَعَك»</p><p>(Ridicule them in verse, and Jibril is with you.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ka`b bin Malik said to the Prophet , \"Allah has revealed what He revealed about the poets. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنَ يُجَاهِدُ بِسَيْفِهِ وَلِسَانِهِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَكَأَنَّ مَا تَرْمُونَهُمْ بِهِ نَضْحُ النَّـبْل»</p><p>(The believer wages Jihad with his sword and with his tongue, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is as if you are attacking them with arrows.)</p><p>وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) This is like the Ayah,</p><p>يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ</p><p>(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers) (40: 52). According to the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Beware of wrongdoing, for wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.) Qatadah bin Di`amah said concerning the Ayah --</p><p>وَسَيَعْلَمْ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ أَىَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.) this refers to the poets and others. This is the end of the Tafsir Surat Ash-Shu`ara'. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.</p>",

    "<h2>The Story of Musa and the End of Fir`awn</h2><p>Here Allah tells His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about what happened to Musa, peace be upon him, how Allah chose him, spoke with him and gave him mighty, dazzling signs and overwhelming proof, and sent him to Fir`awn and his people, but they denied the proof, disbelieved in him and arrogantly refused to follow him. Allah says:</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لاًّهْلِهِ</p><p>(when Musa said to his household), meaning, remember when Musa was traveling with his family and lost his way. This was at night, in the dark. Musa had seen a fire beside the mountain, i.e., he had noticed a fire burning brightly, and said,</p><p>لاًّهْلِهِ إِنِّى آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَـَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</p><p>(to his household: \"Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information...\") meaning, `about the way we should take.'</p><p>أَوْ ءَاتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</p><p>(or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.) meaning, so that they could keep warm. And it was as he said: \"He came back with great news, and a great light.\" Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(But when he came to it, he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it!\") meaning, when he came to it, he saw a great and terrifying sight: the fire was burning in a green bush, and the fire was burning ever brighter while the bush was growing ever more green and beautiful. Then he raised his head, and saw that its light was connected to the clouds of the sky. Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"It was not a fire, rather it was shining light.\" According to one report narrated from Ibn `Abbas, it was the Light of the Lord of the worlds. Musa stood amazed by what he was seeing, and</p><p>نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ</p><p>(he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire...\") Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, Holy is (whosoever is in the fire).\"</p><p>وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(and whosoever is round about it) means, of the angels. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.</p><p>وَسُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists), Who does whatever He wills and there is nothing like Him among His creation. Nothing He has made can encompass Him, and He is the Exalted, the Almighty, Who is utterly unlike all that He has created. Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation.</p><p>يمُوسَى إِنَّهُ أَنَا اللَّهُ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Allah told him that the One Who was addressing him was his Lord Allah, the All-Mighty, Who has subjugated and subdued all things, the One Who is Wise in all His words and deeds. Then He commanded him to throw down the stick that was in his hand, so that He might show him clear proof that He is the One Who is able to do all things, whatever He wills. When Musa threw that stick down, it changed into the form of a huge and terrifying snake, moving quickly despite its size. Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ</p><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a Jann (snake).) Jann refers to a type of snake that is the fastest-moving and most agile. When Musa saw that with his own eyes,</p><p>وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</p><p>(he turned in flight, and did not look back.) meaning, he did not turn around, because he was so afraid. Allah's saying:</p><p>يمُوسَى لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّى لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ</p><p>(O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.) means, `do not be afraid of what you see, for I want to choose you as a Messenger and make you a great Prophet.'</p><p>إَلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوءٍ فَإِنِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an exception of the exclusionary type. This is good news for mankind, for whoever does an evil deed then gives it up and repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:</p><p>وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds, and then Ahtada.) (20:82)</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself...) (4:110). And there are many other Ayat which say the same.</p><p>وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</p><p>(And put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without hurt.) This is another sign, further brilliant proof of the ability of Allah to do whatever He wills. It is also confirmation of the truth of the one to whom the miracle was given. Allah commanded him to put his hand into the opening of his garment, and when he put his hand in and took it out again, it came out white and shining as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of dazzling lightning.</p><p>فِى تِسْعِ ءَايَـتٍ</p><p>(among the nine signs) means, `these are two of the nine signs which you will be supported with and which will serve as proof for you. '</p><p>إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(to Fir`awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious.) These were the nine signs of which Allah said:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى تِسْعَ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ</p><p>(And indeed We gave Musa nine clear signs) (17:101) -- as we have stated there.</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَـتُنَا مُبْصِرَةً</p><p>(But when Our Ayat came to them, clear to see,), i.e., clear and obvious,</p><p>قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(they said: \"This is a manifest magic\".) They wanted to oppose it with their own magic, but they were defeated and were returned disgraced.</p><p>وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا</p><p>(And they belied them) means, verbally,</p><p>وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ</p><p>(though they themselves were convinced thereof.) means, they knew deep down that this was truth from Allah, but they denied it and were stubborn and arrogant.</p><p>ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً</p><p>(wrongfully and arrogantly) means, wronging themselves because this was the despicable manner to which they were accustomed, and they were arrogant because they were too proud to follow the truth. Allah said:</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</p><p>(So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers.) meaning, `see, O Muhammad, what were the consequences of their actions when Allah destroyed them and drowned every last one of them in a single morning.' The point of this story is: beware, `O you who disbelieve in Muhammad ﷺ and deny the Message that he has brought from his Lord, lest the same thing that befell them befall you also.' But what is worse, is that Muhammad ﷺ is nobler and greater than Musa, and his proof is stronger than that of Musa, for the signs that Allah has given him are combined with his presence and his character, in addition to the fact that previous Prophets foretold his coming and took a covenant from the people that they would follow him if they should see him, may the best of blessings and peace from his Lord be upon him.</p>",

When Musa saw that with his own eyes,</p><p>وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</p><p>(he turned in flight, and did not look back.) meaning, he did not turn around, because he was so afraid. Allah's saying:</p><p>يمُوسَى لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّى لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ</p><p>(O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.) means, `do not be afraid of what you see, for I want to choose you as a Messenger and make you a great Prophet.'</p><p>إَلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوءٍ فَإِنِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an exception of the exclusionary type. This is good news for mankind, for whoever does an evil deed then gives it up and repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:</p><p>وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds, and then Ahtada.)

This is another sign, further brilliant proof of the ability of Allah to do whatever He wills. It is also confirmation of the truth of the one to whom the miracle was given. Allah commanded him to put his hand into the opening of his garment, and when he put his hand in and took it out again, it came out white and shining as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of dazzling lightning.</p><p>فِى تِسْعِ ءَايَـتٍ</p><p>(among the nine signs) means, `these are two of the nine signs which you will be supported with and which will serve as proof for you.

The point of this story is: beware, `O you who disbelieve in Muhammad ﷺ and deny the Message that he has brought from his Lord, lest the same thing that befell them befall you also.' But what is worse, is that Muhammad ﷺ is nobler and greater than Musa, and his proof is stronger than that of Musa, for the signs that Allah has given him are combined with his presence and his character, in addition to the fact that previous Prophets foretold his coming and took a covenant from the people that they would follow him if they should see him, may the best of blessings and peace from his Lord be upon him.</p>",
    "<h2>The Story of Musa and the End of Fir`awn</h2><p>Here Allah tells His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about what happened to Musa, peace be upon him, how Allah chose him, spoke with him and gave him mighty, dazzling signs and overwhelming proof, and sent him to Fir`awn and his people, but they denied the proof, disbelieved in him and arrogantly refused to follow him. Allah says:</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لاًّهْلِهِ</p><p>(when Musa said to his household), meaning, remember when Musa was traveling with his family and lost his way. This was at night, in the dark. Musa had seen a fire beside the mountain, i.e., he had noticed a fire burning brightly, and said,</p><p>لاًّهْلِهِ إِنِّى آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَـَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</p><p>(to his household: \"Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information...\") meaning, `about the way we should take.'</p><p>أَوْ ءَاتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</p><p>(or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.) meaning, so that they could keep warm. And it was as he said: \"He came back with great news, and a great light.\" Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(But when he came to it, he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it!\") meaning, when he came to it, he saw a great and terrifying sight: the fire was burning in a green bush, and the fire was burning ever brighter while the bush was growing ever more green and beautiful. Then he raised his head, and saw that its light was connected to the clouds of the sky. Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"It was not a fire, rather it was shining light.\" According to one report narrated from Ibn `Abbas, it was the Light of the Lord of the worlds. Musa stood amazed by what he was seeing, and</p><p>نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ</p><p>(he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire...\") Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, Holy is (whosoever is in the fire).\"</p><p>وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(and whosoever is round about it) means, of the angels. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.</p><p>وَسُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists), Who does whatever He wills and there is nothing like Him among His creation. Nothing He has made can encompass Him, and He is the Exalted, the Almighty, Who is utterly unlike all that He has created. Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation.</p><p>يمُوسَى إِنَّهُ أَنَا اللَّهُ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Allah told him that the One Who was addressing him was his Lord Allah, the All-Mighty, Who has subjugated and subdued all things, the One Who is Wise in all His words and deeds. Then He commanded him to throw down the stick that was in his hand, so that He might show him clear proof that He is the One Who is able to do all things, whatever He wills. When Musa threw that stick down, it changed into the form of a huge and terrifying snake, moving quickly despite its size.

    "<h2>The Story of Musa and the End of Fir`awn</h2><p>Here Allah tells His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about what happened to Musa, peace be upon him, how Allah chose him, spoke with him and gave him mighty, dazzling signs and overwhelming proof, and sent him to Fir`awn and his people, but they denied the proof, disbelieved in him and arrogantly refused to follow him. Allah says:</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَى لاًّهْلِهِ</p><p>(when Musa said to his household), meaning, remember when Musa was traveling with his family and lost his way. This was at night, in the dark. Musa had seen a fire beside the mountain, i.e., he had noticed a fire burning brightly, and said,</p><p>لاًّهْلِهِ إِنِّى آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَـَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</p><p>(to his household: \"Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information...\") meaning, `about the way we should take.'</p><p>أَوْ ءَاتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</p><p>(or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.) meaning, so that they could keep warm. And it was as he said: \"He came back with great news, and a great light.\" Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(But when he came to it, he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it!\") meaning, when he came to it, he saw a great and terrifying sight: the fire was burning in a green bush, and the fire was burning ever brighter while the bush was growing ever more green and beautiful. Then he raised his head, and saw that its light was connected to the clouds of the sky. Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"It was not a fire, rather it was shining light.\" According to one report narrated from Ibn `Abbas, it was the Light of the Lord of the worlds. Musa stood amazed by what he was seeing, and</p><p>نُودِىَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِى النَّارِ</p><p>(he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire...\") Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, Holy is (whosoever is in the fire).\"</p><p>وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p>(and whosoever is round about it) means, of the angels. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.</p><p>وَسُبْحَـنَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists), Who does whatever He wills and there is nothing like Him among His creation. Nothing He has made can encompass Him, and He is the Exalted, the Almighty, Who is utterly unlike all that He has created. Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation.</p><p>يمُوسَى إِنَّهُ أَنَا اللَّهُ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Allah told him that the One Who was addressing him was his Lord Allah, the All-Mighty, Who has subjugated and subdued all things, the One Who is Wise in all His words and deeds. Then He commanded him to throw down the stick that was in his hand, so that He might show him clear proof that He is the One Who is able to do all things, whatever He wills. When Musa threw that stick down, it changed into the form of a huge and terrifying snake, moving quickly despite its size. Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ</p><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a Jann (snake).) Jann refers to a type of snake that is the fastest-moving and most agile. When Musa saw that with his own eyes,</p><p>وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</p><p>(he turned in flight, and did not look back.) meaning, he did not turn around, because he was so afraid. Allah's saying:</p><p>يمُوسَى لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّى لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ</p><p>(O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.) means, `do not be afraid of what you see, for I want to choose you as a Messenger and make you a great Prophet.'</p><p>إَلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوءٍ فَإِنِّى غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an exception of the exclusionary type. This is good news for mankind, for whoever does an evil deed then gives it up and repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:</p><p>وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds, and then Ahtada.) (20:82)</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself...) (4:110). And there are many other Ayat which say the same.</p><p>وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</p><p>(And put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without hurt.)

    "<h2>Dawud and Sulayman (peace be upon them), the organization of Sulayman's Troops and His passage through the Valley of the Ants</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about the great blessings and favors which He bestowed upon two of His servants and Prophets, Dawud (David) and his son Sulayman (Solomon), peace be upon them both, and how they enjoyed happiness in this world and the Hereafter, power and authority in this world, and the position of being Prophets and Messengers. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ عِلْماً وَقَالاَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى فَضَّلَنَا عَلَى كَثِيرٍ مِّنْ عِبَادِهِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And indeed We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulayman, and they both said: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has preferred us above many of His believing servants!\")</p><p>وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</p><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.) means, in kingship and prophethood. What is meant here is not wealth, because if that were the case, Sulayman would not have been singled out from among the sons of Dawud, as Dawud had one hundred wives.

This is why the hoopoe said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way,) meaning, from the way of truth,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(so they have no guidance.) Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَأَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ</div><p>(and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way, so they have no guidance, so they do not prostrate themselves before Allah.) They do not know the way of truth, prostrating only before Allah alone and not before anything that He has created, whether heavenly bodies or anything else. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ </div><p>(And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.

His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ</div><p>(and knows what you conceal and what you reveal.) means, He knows what His servants say and do in secret, and what they say and do openly. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ </div><p>(It is the same whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day) (13:10).

Since the hoopoe was calling to what is good, and for people to worship and prostrate to Allah alone, it would have been forbidden to kill him. Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet forbade killing four kinds of animals: ants, bees, hoopoes and the sparrow hawks. Its chain of narration is Sahih.</p>",
    "<h2>How the Hoopoe came before Sulayman and told Him about Saba'</h2><p>Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ</div><p>(But (the hoopoe) stayed not long,) meaning, he was absent for only a short time. Then he came and said to Sulayman:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَحَطتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ</div><p>(I have grasped which you have not grasped) meaning, `I have come to know something that you and your troops do not know.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجِئْتُكَ مِن سَبَإٍ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ</div><p>(and I have come to you from Saba' with true news.) meaning, with true and certain news. Saba' (Sheba) refers to Himyar, they were a dynasty in Yemen. Then the hoopoe said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى وَجَدتُّ امْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ</div><p>(I found a woman ruling over them,) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This is Bilqis bint Sharahil, the queen of Saba'.\" Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ</div><p>(she has been given all things,) means, all the conveniences of this world that a powerful monarch could need.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(and she has a great throne.) meaning, a tremendous chair adorned with gold and different kinds of jewels and pearls. The historians said, \"This throne was in a great, strong palace which was high and firmly constructed. In it there were three hundred and sixty windows on the east side, and a similar number on the west, and it was constructed in such a way that each day when the sun rose it would shine through one window, and when it set it would shine through the opposite window. And the people used to prostrate to the sun morning and evening. This is why the hoopoe said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way,) meaning, from the way of truth,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(so they have no guidance.)

They do not know the way of truth, prostrating only before Allah alone and not before anything that He has created, whether heavenly bodies or anything else. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ الَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ </div><p>(And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.

    "<h2>Sulayman's Letter to Bilqis</h2><p>Allah tells us what Sulayman said to the hoopoe when he told him about the people of Saba' and their queen:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ سَنَنظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>((Sulayman) said: \"We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are (one) of the liars.\") meaning, `are you telling the truth'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ</div><p>(or you are (one) of the liars.) meaning, `or are you telling a lie in order to save yourself from the threat I made against you'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْهَب بِّكِتَابِى هَـذَا فَأَلْقِهْ إِلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَانْظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُونَ </div><p>(Go you with this letter of mine and deliver it to them then draw back from them and see what they return.) Sulayman wrote a letter to Bilqis and her people and gave it to the hoopoe to deliver. It was said that he carried it on his wings, as is the way with birds, or that he carried it in his beak. He went to their land and found the palace of Bilqis, then he went to her private chambers and threw the letter through a small window, then he stepped to one side out of good manners. Bilqis was amazed and confused when she saw that, then she went and picked up the letter, opened its seal and read it. The letter said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ - أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَىَّ وَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>(it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).')

    "<h2>How the Throne of Bilqis was brought in an Instant</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Yazid bin Ruman: \"When the messengers returned with word of what Sulayman said, she said: `By Allah, I knew he was more than a king, and that we have no power to match him, and that we can gain nothing by being stubborn with him. So, she sent word to him saying: \"I am coming to you with the leaders of my people to see what you will instruct us to do and what you are calling us to of your religion.\" Then she issued commands that her throne, which was made of gold and inlaid with rubies, chrysolite and pearls, should be placed in the innermost of seven rooms, one within the other, and all the doors should be locked. Then she told her deputy whom she was leaving in charge, \"Take care of my people and my throne, and do not let anyone approach it or see it until I come back to you.\" Then she set off to meet Sulayman with twelve thousand of her commanders from the leaders of Yemen, under each of whose command were many thousands of men. Sulayman sent the Jinn to bring him news of her progress and route every day and night, then when she drew near, he gathered together the Jinns and humans who were under his control and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الْمَلأ أَيُّكُمْ يَأْتِينِى بِعَرْشِهَا قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتُونِى مُسْلِمِينَ</div><p>(O chiefs!

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Before you get up from where you are sitting.\" As-Suddi and others said: \"He used to sit to pass judgements and rulings over the people, and to eat, from the beginning of the day until noon.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنِّى عَلَيْهِ لَقَوِىٌّ أَمِينٌ</div><p>(And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.) Ibn `Abbas said: \"Strong enough to carry it and trustworthy with the jewels it contains. Sulayman, upon him be peace, said, \"I want it faster than that.\" From this it seems that Sulayman wanted to bring this throne as a demonstration of the greatness of the power and authority that Allah had bestowed upon him and the troops that He had subjugated to him. Power such as had never been given to anyone else, before or since, so that this would furnish proof of his prophethood before Bilqis and her people, because this would be a great and wondrous thing, if he brought her throne as if he were in her country, before they could come to it, although it was hidden and protected by so many locked doors.

    "<h2>The Test of Bilqis</h2><p>When Sulayman brought the throne of Bilqis before she and her people arrived, he issued orders that some of its features should be altered, so that he could test her and see whether she recognized it and how composed she would be when she saw it.

    "<h2>The Plot of the Mischief-Makers and the End of the People of Thamud</h2><p>Allah tells us about the evildoers of Thamud and their leaders who used to call their people to misguidance and disbelief, and to deny Salih. Eventually they killed the she-camel and were about to kill Salih too. They plotted to let him sleep with his family at night, then they would assassinate him and tell his relatives that they knew nothing about what happened to him, and that they were telling the truth because none of them had seen anything. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ</div><p>(And there were in the city) meaning, in the city of Thamud,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ</div><p>(nine Raht,) meaning, nine people,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُفْسِدُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ يُصْلِحُونَ</div><p>(who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.) They forced their opinions on the people of Thamud, because they were the leaders and chiefs. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"These were the people who killed the she-camel,\" Meaning, that happened upon their instigation, may Allah curse them. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَادَوْاْ صَـحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَى فَعَقَرَ </div><p>(But they called their comrade and he took (a sword) and killed (the she-camel). ) (54:29)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذِ انبَعَثَ أَشْقَـهَا </div><p>(When the most wicked man among them went forth (to kill the she-camel).)

Imam Malik narrated from Yahya bin Sa`id that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said: \"Cutting gold and silver (coins) is part of spreading corruption on earth.\" What is meant is that the nature of these evil disbelievers was to spread corruption on earth by every means possible, one of which was that mentioned by these Imams.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ تَقَاسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ لَنُبَيِّتَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ</div><p>(They said: \"Swear one to another by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household...\") They took a mutual oath, pledging that during the night, whoever met the Allah's Prophet Salih, peace be upon him, he would assassinate him. But Allah planned against them and caused their plot to backfire. Mujahid said, \"They took a mutual oath pledging to kill him, but before they could reach him, they and their people were all destroyed.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Hatim said: \"When they killed the she-camel, Salih said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَمَتَّعُواْ فِى دَارِكُمْ ثَلَـثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ</div><p>(\"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. This is a promise (i.e., a threat) that will not be belied.\") (11:65). They said: `Salih claims that he will finish with us in three days, but we will finish him and his family before the three days are over.' Salih had a place of worship in a rocky tract in a valley, where he used to pray. So they set out to go to a cave there one night, and said, `When he comes to pray, we will kill him, then we will return. When we have finished him off, we will go to his family and finish them off too.' Then Allah sent down a rock upon them from the mountains round about; they feared that it would crush them, so they ran into the cave and the rock covered the mouth of the cave while they were inside. Their people did not know where they were or what had happened to them. So Allah punished some of them here, and some of them there, and He saved Salih and the people who were with him. Then he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَـهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْبُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةً</div><p>(So, they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.

    "<h2>The Command to praise Allah and send Blessings on His Messengers</h2><p>Allah commands His Messenger to say:</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ</p><p>(Praise and thanks be to Allah,) meaning, for His innumerable blessings upon His servants and for His exalted Attributes and most beautiful Names. And He commands him to send peace upon the servants of Allah whom He chose and selected, i.e., His noble Messengers and Prophets, may the best of peace and blessings from Allah be upon them. This was the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others; the meaning of the servants He has chose is the Prophets. He said, \"This like He said in the Ayah;</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ الْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>وَسَلَـمٌ عَلَى الْمُرْسَلِينَ - وَالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of honor and power! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him! And peace be on the Messengers! And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, Lord of all that exists.) (37:180-182).\" Ath-Thawri and As-Suddi said, \"This refers to the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ, may Allah be pleased with them all.\" Something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and there is no contradiction between the two views, because they were also among the servants of Allah whom He had chosen, although the description is more befitting of the Prophets.</p><p>ءَآللَّهُ خَيْرٌ أَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Is Allah better, or what they ascribe as partners (to Him)) This is a question aimed at denouncing the idolators for their worship of other gods besides Allah. Some more Proofs of Tawhid Then Allah begins to explain that He is the Only One Who creates, provides and controls, as He says:</p><p>أَمَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ</p><p>(Is not He Who created the heavens) meaning, He created those heavens which are so high and serene, with their shining stars and revolving planets. And He created the earth, with its varying heights and densities, and He created everything in it, mountains, hills, plains, rugged terrain, wildernesses, crops, trees, fruits, seas and animals of all different kinds and colors and shapes, etc.</p><p>وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً</p><p>(and sends down for you water from the sky,) means, He sends it as a provision for His servants,</p><p>فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ</p><p>(whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight) means, beautiful and delightful to behold.</p><p>مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنبِتُواْ شَجَرَهَا</p><p>(It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees.) meaning, `you are not able to cause their trees to grow. The One Who is able to do that is the Creator and Provider, Who is doing all this Alone and Independent of any idol and other rival.' The idolators themselves admitted this, as Allah says in another Ayah:</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you ask them: \"Who has created them\" they will certainly say: \"Allah.\") (31:25)</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you were to ask them: \"Who sends down water from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death\" they will surely reply: \"Allah.\") (29:63) Meaning they will admit that He is the One Who does all these things, Alone, with no partner or associate, but then they worship others alongside Him, others who they admit cannot create or provide anything. But the Only One Who deserves to be worshipped is the Only One Who can create and provide, Allah says:</p><p>أَإِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Is there any god with Allah) meaning, `is there any god that can be worshipped alongside Allah, when it is clear to you and anyone who with reason that He is the Creator and Provider, as you yourselves admit' Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ</p><p>(Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!) meaning, they describe others as being equal and comparable to Allah.</p>"
