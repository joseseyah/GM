In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:</p><p>«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»</p><p>(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth. Masjur, means, the sea will be kindled with fire on the Day of Resurrection just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)(81:6) i.e., it will be kindled with fire and become a raging fire that surrounds the people in the gathering area, this was reported by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Ali bin Abi Talib. It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass. There is none that can avert it.) `Umar said, `By the Lord of the Ka`bah, this is a true vow.' `Umar dismounted his donkey and sat next to a wall for a while. He then went back to his house and fell ill for a month. During his illness, the people would visit him, not knowing what caused his illness.\" May Allah be pleased with `Umar.</p><h2>Describing the Day of Torment, the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً</p><p>(On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: \"Shaking violently.\" Also from Ibn `Abbas, \"Split.\" Mujahid said: \"Spin violently.\" Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, saying, \"The earth will violently spin and move by the command of Allah, and its areas will violently move towards each other.\" This was preferred by Ibn Jarir, because of the meaning of the word, Mawra, which denotes meanings of spinning and shaking. Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone. Most certainly, Allah recompenses each according to their deeds.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَعِيمٍ - فَـكِهِينَ بِمَآ ءَاتَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ وَوَقَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ عَذَابَ الْجَحِيمِ</p>",

    "<h2>The Offspring of Righteous Believers will be elevated to Their Grades in Paradise</h2><p>In this Ayah, Allah the Exalted affirms His favor, generosity, graciousness, compassion and beneficence towards His creation. When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,</p><p>أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«هُمَا فِي النَّار»</p><p>(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,</p><p>«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»</p><p>(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,</p><p>«فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.) The Prophet then recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith...)\" Certainly, it is Allah's grace and favor that He grants the children this blessing because of the good deeds of their parents. He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»</p><p>(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord! How did I earn this\" Allah will reply, \"Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.\") This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»</p><p>(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)</p><h2>Allah is Just with the Sinners</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right. In Gardens, they will ask one another about the criminals.)(74:38-41)</p><h2>Description of the Khamr of Paradise and the Delight of its Dwellers</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَمْدَدْنَـهُم بِفَـكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.) meaning, `We shall provide them with various types and kinds of fruits and meat, whatever they wish for and desire,'</p><p>يَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً</p><p>(There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup,) meaning, of wine, according to Ad-Dahhak,</p><p>لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p>(free from any Laghw, and free from Ta'thim) meaning, when they drink, they do not say any idle, vain words or utter dirty, sinful speech like the drunken people in this life do. Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.)(37:46-47) and,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom they will get neither nay aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:19) Allah the Exalted said here,</p><p>يَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p>(There they shall pass from hand to hand a (wine) cup, free from any Laghw, and free from sin.)

    "<h2>The Offspring of Righteous Believers will be elevated to Their Grades in Paradise</h2><p>In this Ayah, Allah the Exalted affirms His favor, generosity, graciousness, compassion and beneficence towards His creation. When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,</p><p>أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.)

Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring.

    "<h2>The Offspring of Righteous Believers will be elevated to Their Grades in Paradise</h2><p>In this Ayah, Allah the Exalted affirms His favor, generosity, graciousness, compassion and beneficence towards His creation. When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,</p><p>أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«هُمَا فِي النَّار»</p><p>(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,</p><p>«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»</p><p>(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,</p><p>«فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.)

He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»</p><p>(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord!

    "<h2>The Offspring of Righteous Believers will be elevated to Their Grades in Paradise</h2><p>In this Ayah, Allah the Exalted affirms His favor, generosity, graciousness, compassion and beneficence towards His creation. When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,</p><p>أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«هُمَا فِي النَّار»</p><p>(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,</p><p>«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»</p><p>(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,</p><p>«فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.)

He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»</p><p>(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord! How did I earn this\" Allah will reply, \"Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.\") This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»</p><p>(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)</p><h2>Allah is Just with the Sinners</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right.

Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers.

Ad-Dahhak said, \"Meaning to stand for the Salah (and say): \"Glorious are You and with Your praise, Hallowed be Your Name, Exalted be Your majesty, and there is no God (worthy of worship) except You.\" In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Umar used to recite this supplication when he began Salah. Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded this Hadith from Abu Sa`id and other Companions, who stated that the Prophet used to say that.

Suporting this view is the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ تَعَارَّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَقَالَ: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ وَلَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ. ثُمَّ قَالَ: رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي أو قال: ثُمَّ دَعَا اسْتُجِيبَ لَهُ، فَإِنْ عَزَمَ فَتَوَضَّأَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى، قُبِلَتْ صَلَاتُه»</p><p>(Whoever gets up at night and says: `La ilaha illallah, He is One without partners.

There is neither might nor power except Allah.' And then says, `O Lord! Forgive me.' Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, \"From every gathering you sit in.\" Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.\"' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ جَلَسَ فِي مَجْلِسٍ فَكَثُرَ فِيهِ لَغَطُهُ، فَقَالَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللْهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ، إِلَّا غَفَرَ اللهُ لَهُ مَا كَانَ فِي مَجْلِسِهِ ذلِك»</p><p>(Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.' Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah the Exalted said;</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ</p><p>(And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night.

It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.)(17:79) Allah said;</p><p>وَإِدْبَـرَ النُّجُومِ</p><p>(and at the setting of the stars.) is in reference to the two voluntary Rak`ahs before the Dawn prayer, according to a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas. These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.\" In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَكْعَتَا الْفَجْرِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.</p>",

Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith.

Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah the Exalted said;</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ</p><p>(And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night.

These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.\" In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَكْعَتَا الْفَجْرِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.</p>",

Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, \"From every gathering you sit in.\" Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.\"' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ جَلَسَ فِي مَجْلِسٍ فَكَثُرَ فِيهِ لَغَطُهُ، فَقَالَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللْهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ، إِلَّا غَفَرَ اللهُ لَهُ مَا كَانَ فِي مَجْلِسِهِ ذلِك»</p><p>(Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.' Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah the Exalted said;</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ</p><p>(And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا</p><p>(And in some of the night, offer Tahajjud in it as an additional (prayer) for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.)(17:79) Allah said;</p><p>وَإِدْبَـرَ النُّجُومِ</p><p>(and at the setting of the stars.) is in reference to the two voluntary Rak`ahs before the Dawn prayer, according to a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas. These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.\" In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَكْعَتَا الْفَجْرِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.</p>",
    "<h2>The Stubbornness of the Idolators; Their Punishment</h2><p>Allah the Exalted reaffirms the stubbornness of the idolators and their ignorance of what goes around them,</p><p>وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كِسْفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ سَـقِطاً</p><p>(And if they were to see a piece of the heaven falling down,) meaning, on them as punishment, they would not believe it is coming their way, saying that, these are layers of clouds on top of each other. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَاباً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّواْ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ - لَقَالُواْ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا بَلْ نَحْنُ قَوْمٌ مَّسْحُورُونَ</p><p>(And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep on ascending thereto (all day long), they would surely say (in the evening): \"Our eyes have been dazzled. Nay, we are a people bewitched.\")(15:14-15) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ</p><p>(So leave them alone), `O Muhammad,'</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ</p><p>(till they meet their Day, in which they will sink into a fainting.) on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>يَوْمَ لاَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْئاً</p><p>(The Day when their plotting shall not avail them at all, ) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, their deceit and plots they planned in this life shall not help them in the least,</p><p>وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ</p><p>(nor will they be helped.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ عَذَاباً دُونَ ذَلِكَ</p><p>(And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment before this;) meaning, that of being the torment in this world. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may return.)(32:21) Allah said;</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(but most of them know not.) meaning, `We will torment them in the life of the world and test them with various hardships, so that they might go back and repent. However, they do not understand what is happening to them or why, because when the torment is removed, they revert to committing the worst of what they used to do before.' A Hadith states that,</p><h2>Ordering the Prophet to have Patience and to glorify Allah</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا</p><p>(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes;) meaning, `be patient in the face of their annoyance and do not be concerned about it, for you are under Our Eyes and Protection, and We will surely protect you from the people,'</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Meaning to stand for the Salah (and say): \"Glorious are You and with Your praise, Hallowed be Your Name, Exalted be Your majesty, and there is no God (worthy of worship) except You.\" In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Umar used to recite this supplication when he began Salah. Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded this Hadith from Abu Sa`id and other Companions, who stated that the Prophet used to say that. Abu Al-Jawza' commented on the Ayah;</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"From your sleep, from your bed.\" And this is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. Suporting this view is the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ تَعَارَّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَقَالَ: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ وَلَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ. ثُمَّ قَالَ: رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي أو قال: ثُمَّ دَعَا اسْتُجِيبَ لَهُ، فَإِنْ عَزَمَ فَتَوَضَّأَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى، قُبِلَتْ صَلَاتُه»</p><p>(Whoever gets up at night and says: `La ilaha illallah, He is One without partners. For Him is the kingdom and all praise is due to Him. He has power over all things. Glory be to Allah, and all praise is due to Allah, and La illaha illallah and Allah is Greater. There is neither might nor power except Allah.' And then says, `O Lord! Forgive me.' Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, \"From every gathering you sit in.\" Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,</p><p>وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p>(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.\"' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ جَلَسَ فِي مَجْلِسٍ فَكَثُرَ فِيهِ لَغَطُهُ، فَقَالَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللْهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ، إِلَّا غَفَرَ اللهُ لَهُ مَا كَانَ فِي مَجْلِسِهِ ذلِك»</p><p>(Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.'

    "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The First Surah in which a Prostration is revealed</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"Surat An-Najm was the first Surah in which a prostration was revealed.

Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"The star refers to Pleiades when it sets at Fajr.\" Ad-Dahhak said \"When the Shayatin are shot with it.\" And this Ayah is like Allah's saying;</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِمَوَقِعِ النُّجُومِ - وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ - إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(So, I swear by the setting of the stars. And verily, that is indeed a great oath, if you but know. That is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of all that exists.)(56:75-80) Allah said;</p><p>مَا ضَلَّ صَـحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَى</p><p>(Your companion has neither gone astray nor has erred.) This contains the subject of the oath. This part of the Ayah is the witness that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is sane and a follower of Truth. He is neither led astray, such as in the case of the ignorant who does not proceed on any path with knowledge, nor is he one who erred, such as in the case of the knowledgeable, who knows the Truth, yet deviates from it intentionally to something else. Therefore, Allah exonerated His Messenger and his Message from being similar to the misguided ways of the Christians and the erroneous paths of the Jews, such as knowing the Truth and hiding it, while abiding by falsehood. Rather, he, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him, and his glorious Message that Allah has sent him with, are on the perfect straight path, following guidance and what is correct.</p><h2>Muhammad ﷺ was sent as a Mercy for all that exists; He does not speak of His Desire</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى</p><p>(Nor does he speak of desire), asserting that nothing the Prophet utters is of his own desire or wish,</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ وَحْىٌ يُوحَى</p><p>(It is only a revelation revealed.), means, he only conveys to the people what he was commanded to convey, in its entirety without additions or deletions. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ بِشَفَاعَةِ رَجُلٍ لَيْسَ بِنَبِيَ مِثْلُ الْحَيَّيْنِ أَوْ مِثْلُ أَحَدِ الْحَيَّيْنِ رَبِيعَةَ وَمُضَر»</p><p>(Verily, numbers similar to the two tribes, or one of them, Rabi`ah and Mudar, will enter Paradise on account of the intercession of one man, who is not a Prophet.) A man asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Is not Rabi`ah a subtribe of Mudar.\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا أَقُولُ مَا أَقُول»</p><p>(I said what I said.) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"I used to record everything I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ so it would be preserved. The Quraysh discouraged me from this, saying, `You record everything you hear from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, even though he is human and sometimes speaks when he is angry' I stopped recording the Hadiths for a while, but later mentioned what they said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«اكْتُبْ، فَوَ الَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا خَرَجَ مِنِّي إِلَّا الْحَق»</p><p>(Write! By He in Whose Hand is my soul, every word that comes out of me is the Truth.)\" Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.)

Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.

Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw.

This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.)

Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.)

This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.)

Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw.

Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.

Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith.

Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>The Trustworthy Angel brought Allah's Revelation to the Trustworthy Messenger</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the Message His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ brought to people was taught to him by,</p><p>شَدِيدُ الْقُوَى</p><p>(mighty in power), he is Jibril, peace be upon him,</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ ذِى قُوَّةٍ عِندَ ذِى الْعَرْشِ مَكِينٍ مُّطَـعٍ ثَمَّ أَمِينٍ</p><p>(Verily, this is the Word a most honorable messenger, owner of power, with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne, obeyed (by the angels) and trustworthy.)(81:19-21) Allah said here,</p><p>ذُو مِرَّةٍ</p><p>(Dhu Mirrah), meaning, he is mighty in power, according to Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. In an authentic Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Umar and Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تَحِلُّ الصَّدَقَةُ لِغَنِيَ وَلَا لِذِي مِرَّةٍ سَوِي»</p><p>(Charity is not allowed for a rich person nor Dhu Mirrah (a strong person) of sound mind and body.) Allah said;</p><p>فَاسْتَوَى</p><p>(then he Istawa (rose).) this refers to the angel Jibril, according to Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas,</p><p>وَهُوَ بِالاٍّفُقِ الاٌّعْلَى</p><p>(While he was in the highest part of the horizon.) meaning, Jibril rose to the highest part of the horizon, according to `Ikrimah and several others; `Ikrimah said, \"The highest horizon where the morning comes from.\" Mujahid said, \"It is (the place of) sunrise.\" Qatadah said, \"That from which the day comes.\" Ibn Zayd and several others said similarly. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah saw Jibril in his original shape having six hundred wings, each wing filling the side of the horizon, with a colorful array, and pearls and rubies falling from each wing as much as only Allah knows.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, \"The Prophet asked Jibril to appear himself to him in his original shape and Jibril said to him, `Invoke your Lord.' The Prophet invoked his Lord the Exalted and Most Honored, and a great huge figure appeared to him from the east and kept rising and spreading. When the Prophet saw Jibril in his original shape, he was knocked unconscious. Jibril came down and revived the Prophet and wiped the saliva off of his cheeks.\"' Only Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p><h2>Meaning of \"at a distance of two bows' length or less</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bows` length or less.) means, Jibril came closer to Muhammad ﷺ when Jibril was descending to him on earth. At that time, the distance between them became only two bow lengths, when the bows are extended to full length, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. It was said that the meaning here is the distance between the bow's string and its wood center. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(or less) indicates that the distance was as only as far described, not more. This type of usage is found in several instances in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذلِكَ فَهِىَ كَالْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً</p><p>(Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness.)(2:74) The Ayah says that their hearts became not softer than rocks, but as hard and difficult as rocks, and more. There is a similar Ayah,</p><p>يَخْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً</p><p>(fear men as they fear Allah or even more.)(4:77), and Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى مِاْئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ</p><p>(And We sent him to hundred thousand (people) or even more.)(37:147), indicating that they were not less than a hundred thousand, but that amount or more. Therefore, this verifies the facts mentioned, leaving no doubt or means of refute. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) We stated before that it was Jibril who came down near the Prophet , according to `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurayrah. We will mention their statements about this soon afterwards, Allah willing. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said about this Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less.) \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ لَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril; he had six hundred wings.)\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Talq bin Ghannam said that Za'idah said that Ash-Shaybani said, \"I asked Zirr about the Ayah,</p><p>فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَى - فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(And was at a distance of two bow lengths or less. So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) Zirr said, \"Abdullah narrated to us that Muhammad ﷺ saw Jibril having six hundred wings.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So he revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) means, Jibril conveyed to Allah's servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever he conveyed. Or, the meaning here could be: Allah revealed to His servant Muhammad ﷺ whatever He revealed through Jibril. Both meanings are correct. Sa`id bin Jubayr said about Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَوْحَى إِلَى عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَى</p><p>(So He revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.) \"Allah revealed to him,</p><p>أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً</p><p>(Did He not find you an orphan.)(93:6), and,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ</p><p>(And have We not raised high your fame)(94:4)\" Someone else said, \"Allah revealed to the Prophet that the Prophets will not enter Paradise until he enters it first, and the nations will not enter it until his Ummah enters it first.\"</p><h2>Did the Prophet see His Lord during the Night of Isra</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى - أَفَتُمَـرُونَهُ عَلَى مَا يَرَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw. Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.)

Will you then dispute with him about what he saw) Muslim recorded from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى</p><p>(The heart lied not in what he saw), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent.) \"He saw Allah twice in his heart.\" Simak reported a similar from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. Abu Salih, As-Suddi and several others said similarly that the Prophet saw Allah twice in his heart.Masruq said, \"I went to `A'ishah and asked her, `Did Muhammad ﷺ see his Lord' She said, `You said something that caused my hair to rise!' I said, `Behold!' and recited this Ayah,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) She said, `Where did your mind wander It was Jibril. Whoever says to you that Muhammad ﷺ saw his Lord, or hid any part of what he was commanded (i.e., Allah's Message), or knew any of the five things which only Allah knows,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain...)(31:34), Then he invents a great lie against Allah! The Prophet only saw Jibril twice, in his original shape, once near Sidrat Al-Muntaha and another time in Ajyad (in Makkah) while Jibril had six hundred wings that covered the horizon.\"' Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Have you seen your Lord' He said,</p><p>«نُورٌ أَنَّى أَرَاه»</p><p>(How can I see Him since there was a light)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ نُورًا»</p><p>(I only saw a light.) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى - عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَى - عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent. Near Sidrat Al-Muntaha.) \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاحٍ يَنْتَثِرُ مِنْ رِيشِهِ التَّهَاوِيلُ مِنَ الدُّرِّ وَالْيَاقُوت»</p><p>(I saw Jibril while he had six hundred wings and a colorful array of pearls and rubies falling from the feathers of his wings.)\" This Hadith has a good, strong chain of narration. Ahmad also recorded that `Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw Jibril in his original shape while Jibril had six hundred wings, each wing covering the side of the horizon. From his wings, precious stones were dropping of which only Allah has knowledge.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ جِبْرِيلَ عَلَى سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى وَلَهُ سِتُّمِائَةِ جَنَاح»</p><p>(I saw Jibril over Sidrat Al-Muntaha while he had six hundred wings.)\" One of the subnarrators of the Hadith asked `Asim about Jibril's wings and `Asim refused to elaborate. So some of his companions were asked and one of them said, \"Each wing was covering what is between the east and the west.\" This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فِي خُضْرٍ مُعَلَّقٍ بِهِ الدُّر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me wearing green with pearls hanging down.) This Hadith has a good chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir said that Masruq asked `A'ishah, \"O Mother of the faithful, has Muhammad ﷺ seen his Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored\" She said, \"Glorious is Allah! My hair is standing on end because of what you said. Three matters, if one tells you about any of them, will have lied. Whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has seen his Lord, will have lied.\" She then recited these two Ayat,</p><p>لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الاٌّبْصَـرَ</p><p>(No vision can grasp Him, but He grasps all vision.)(6:103), and,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ</p><p>(It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by revelation, or from behind a veil.)(42:51) She went one, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ knew what the morrow will bring, will have uttered a lie.\" She then recited,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ</p><p>(Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.)(31:34) `A'ishah said, \"And whoever tells you that Muhammad ﷺ has hidden any part of the Message will have lied,\" and she then recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(O Messenger proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)(5:67).She went one, \"However, he saw Jibril twice in his original shape.\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that Masruq said, \"I asked `A'ishah, `Did not Allah say,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ بِالاٍّفُقِ الْمُبِينِ</p><p>(And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.)(81:23), and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ رَءَاهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَى</p><p>(And indeed he saw him at a second descent)' She said, `I was the first among this Ummah to ask Allah's Messenger ﷺ about it. He said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا ذَاكَ جِبْرِيل»</p><p>(That was Jibril.) He only saw him twice in his actual and real figure. He saw Jibril descend from heaven to earth and was so huge that he covered the whole horizon between the sky and earth.)\"' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs via Ash-Sha`bi.</p><h2>Angels, Light and colors covered Sidrat Al-Muntaha</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) We mentioned before, in the Hadiths about Al-Isra' that the angels, Allah's Light, and spectacular colors covered the Sidrah. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was taken on the Isra' journey, he ascended to Sidrat Al-Muntaha, which is in the seventh heaven. There everything terminates that ascends from the earth and is held there, and terminates everything that descends from above it is held there,</p><p>إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى</p><p>(When that covered the lote tree which did cover it!) He said, \"Golden butterflies. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was given three things: He was given the five prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surat Al-Baqarah (2:284-286), and remission of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate anything with Allah.\" Muslim collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(The sight turned not aside, nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) indicates that the Prophet's sight did not turn right or left, according to `Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>وَمَا طَغَى</p><p>(nor it transgressed beyond the limit.) not exceeding what has been ordained for it. This is a tremendous quality that demonstrates the Prophet's firm obedience to Allah, because he only did what was commanded and did ask beyond what he was given. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) is similar to another Ayah,</p><p>لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ءْايَـتِنَآ</p><p>(In order that We might show him of Our Ayat.)(17:1), meaning, signs that testify to Allah's might and greatness. Relying on these two Ayat, some scholars of Ahl us-Sunnah said that the Prophet did not see Allah during the Isra' journey, because Allah said,</p><p>لَقَدْ رَأَى مِنْ ءَايَـتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَى</p><p>(Indeed he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.) They said that, had the Prophet seen his Lord, Allah would have conveyed this news and the Prophet would have narrated it to the people.</p>",
    "<h2>Refuting Idolatry, Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza</h2><p>Allah the Exalted rebukes the idolators for worshipping idols and taking rivals to Him. They built houses for their idols to resemble the Ka`bah built by Prophet Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil.</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat,) Al-Lat was a white stone with inscriptions on. There was a house built around Al-Lat in At-Ta'if with curtains, servants and a sacred courtyard around it. The people of At-Ta'if, the tribe of Thaqif and their allies, worshipped Al-Lat. They would boast to Arabs, except the Quraysh, that they had Al-Lat. Ibn Jarir said, \"They derived Al-Lat's name from Allah's Name, and made it feminine. Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. It was reported that Al-Lat is pronounced Al-Lat because, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq (a kind of barley mash) with water for the pilgrims during the time of Jahiliyyah. When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى</p><p>(Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.) \"Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq for the pilgrims.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"They also derived the name for their idol Al-`Uzza from Allah's Name Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered Al-`Uzza.\" During the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan said, \"We have Al-`Uzza, but you do not have Al-`Uzza.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,</p><p>«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</p><p>(Say, \"Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.\") Manat was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere Manat during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to announce Hajj to the Ka`bah from next to Manat. Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him,</p><p>«ارْجِعْ فَإِنَّكَ لَمْ تَصْنَعْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.) Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said to him,</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى»</p><p>(That was Al-`Uzza!)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, \"Al-Lat belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of Al-Lat and its servants.\" I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy Al-Lat. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza. And Manat, the other third), then Allah said,</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females) Allah asked the idolators, `do you choose female offspring for Allah and give preference to yourselves with the males If you made this division between yourselves and the created, it would be,</p><p>قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(a division most unfair!)' meaning, it would be an unfair and unjust division. `How is it then that you make this division between you and Allah, even though this would be foolish and unjust, if you made it between yourselves and others' Allah the Exalted refutes such innovated lies, falsehood and atheism they invented through worshipping the idols and calling them gods,</p><p>إِنْ هِىَ إِلاَّ أَسْمَآءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُم</p><p>(They are but names which you have named -- you and your fathers) of your own desire,</p><p>مَّآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَـنٍ</p><p>(for which Allah has sent down no authority.) meaning, proof,</p><p>إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الاٌّنفُسُ</p><p>(They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire,) they have no proof, except their trust in their forefathers who took this false path in the past, as well as, their lusts and desires to become leaders, and thereby gain honor and reverence for their forefathers,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!), meaning, Allah has sent them Messengers with the clear truth and unequivocal evidence.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا تَمَنَّى أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَنْظُرْ مَا يَتَمَنَّى، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَدْرِي مَا يُكْتَبُ لَهُ مِنْ أُمْنِيَّتِه»</p><p>(When one of you wishes for something, let him be careful with what he wishes for, because he does not know what part of his wish will be written for him.)Only Ahmad collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَلِلَّهِ الاٌّخِرَةُ والاٍّولَى</p><p>(But to Allah belongs the last and the first.) meaning, all matters belong to Allah and He is the King and Owner of this world and the Hereafter, Who does what He will in both lives. Whatever He wills, occurs and whatever He does not will, never occurs.</p><h2>No Interecession except with Allah's Leave</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى</p><p>(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.) As He said;</p><p>مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p>(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission )(2:255) and,</p><p>وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ</p><p>(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) (34:23) `If this is the case with the angels who are close to Him, how can you, O ignorant ones, hope for Allah to grant you the intercession of the idols and rivals you worship with Him without having His permission or any divine legislation permitting you to worship them' Rather, Allah has forbidden idol worshipping by the tongues of all of His Messengers and He revealed this prohibition in all of His Books.</p>",

    "<h2>Refuting Idolatry, Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza</h2><p>Allah the Exalted rebukes the idolators for worshipping idols and taking rivals to Him. They built houses for their idols to resemble the Ka`bah built by Prophet Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil.</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat,) Al-Lat was a white stone with inscriptions on. There was a house built around Al-Lat in At-Ta'if with curtains, servants and a sacred courtyard around it. The people of At-Ta'if, the tribe of Thaqif and their allies, worshipped Al-Lat. They would boast to Arabs, except the Quraysh, that they had Al-Lat. Ibn Jarir said, \"They derived Al-Lat's name from Allah's Name, and made it feminine. Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. It was reported that Al-Lat is pronounced Al-Lat because, according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq (a kind of barley mash) with water for the pilgrims during the time of Jahiliyyah. When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى</p><p>(Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.) \"Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq for the pilgrims.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"They also derived the name for their idol Al-`Uzza from Allah's Name Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered Al-`Uzza.\" During the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan said, \"We have Al-`Uzza, but you do not have Al-`Uzza.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,</p><p>«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</p><p>(Say, \"Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.\") Manat was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere Manat during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to announce Hajj to the Ka`bah from next to Manat. Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it.

Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said to him,</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى»</p><p>(That was Al-`Uzza!)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, \"Al-Lat belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of Al-Lat and its servants.\" I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy Al-Lat. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.

They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.

When he died, they remained next to his grave and worshipped him.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى</p><p>(Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza.) \"Al-Lat was a man who used to mix Sawiq for the pilgrims.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"They also derived the name for their idol Al-`Uzza from Allah's Name Al-`Aziz. Al-`Uzza was a tree on which the idolators placed a monument and curtains, in the area of Nakhlah, between Makkah and At-Ta'if. The Quraysh revered Al-`Uzza.\" During the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan said, \"We have Al-`Uzza, but you do not have Al-`Uzza.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ replied,</p><p>«قُولُوا: اللهُ مَوْلَانَا وَلَا مَوْلَى لَكُم»</p><p>(Say, \"Allah is Our Supporter, but you have no support.\") Manat was another idol in the area of Mushallal near Qudayd, between Makkah and Al-Madinah. The tribes of Khuza`ah, Aws and Khazraj used to revere Manat during the time of Jahiliyyah. They used to announce Hajj to the Ka`bah from next to Manat. Al-Bukhari collected a statement from `A'ishah with this meaning. There were other idols in the Arabian Peninsula that the Arabs revered just as they revered the Ka`bah, besides the three idols that Allah mentioned in His Glorious Book. Allah mentioned these three here because they were more famous than the others. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ conquered Makkah, he sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the area of Nakhlah where the idol of Al-`Uzza was erected on three trees of a forest. Khalid cut the three trees and approached the house built around it and destroyed it. When he went back to the Prophet and informed him of the story, the Prophet said to him,</p><p>«ارْجِعْ فَإِنَّكَ لَمْ تَصْنَعْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.) Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said to him,</p><p>«تِلْكَ الْعُزَّى»</p><p>(That was Al-`Uzza!)\" Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated, \"Al-Lat belonged to the tribe of Thaqif in the area of At-Ta'if. Banu Mu`attib were the custodians of Al-Lat and its servants.\" I say that the Prophet sent Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb to destroy Al-Lat. They carried out the Prophet's command and built a Masjid in its place in the city of At-Ta'if. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Manat used to be the idol of the Aws and Khazraj tribes and those who followed their religion in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Manat was near the coast, close to the area of Mushallal in Qudayd. The Prophet sent Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb or `Ali bin Abi Talib to demolish it. Ibn Ishaq said that Dhul-Khalasah was the idol of the tribes of Daws, Khath`am and Bajilah, and the Arabs who resided in the area of Tabalah. I say that Dhul-Khalasah was called the Southern Ka`bah, and the Ka`bah in Makkah was called the Northern Ka`bah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali to Dhul-Khalasah and he destroyed it. Ibn Ishaq said that Fals was the idol of Tay' and the neighboring tribes in the Mount of Tay', such as Salma and Ajja. Ibn Hisham said that some scholars of knowledge told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent `Ali bin Abi Talib to Fals and he destroyed it and found two swords in its treasure, which the Prophet then gave to `Ali as war spoils. Muhammad bin Ishaq also said that the tribes of Himyar, and Yemen in general, had a house of worship in San`a' called Riyam. He mentioned that there was a black dog in it and that the religious men who went with Tubba` removed it, killed it and demolished the building. Ibn Ishaq said that Ruda' was a structure of Bani Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d bin Zayd Manat bin Tamim, which Al-Mustawghir bin Rabi`ah bin Ka`b bin Sa`d demolished after Islam. In Sindad there was Dhul-Ka`bat, the idol of the tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of the Wa'il, and also the Iyad tribes.</p><h2>Refuting the Idolators Who appoint Rivals to Allah and claim that the Angels were Females</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ اللَّـتَ وَالْعُزَّى - وَمَنَوةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(Have you then considered Al-Lat, and Al-`Uzza. And Manat, the other third), then Allah said,</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females) Allah asked the idolators, `do you choose female offspring for Allah and give preference to yourselves with the males If you made this division between yourselves and the created, it would be,</p><p>قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(a division most unfair!)' meaning, it would be an unfair and unjust division. `How is it then that you make this division between you and Allah, even though this would be foolish and unjust, if you made it between yourselves and others' Allah the Exalted refutes such innovated lies, falsehood and atheism they invented through worshipping the idols and calling them gods,</p><p>إِنْ هِىَ إِلاَّ أَسْمَآءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَءَابَآؤُكُم</p><p>(They are but names which you have named -- you and your fathers) of your own desire,</p><p>مَّآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَـنٍ</p><p>(for which Allah has sent down no authority.) meaning, proof,</p><p>إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الاٌّنفُسُ</p><p>(They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire,) they have no proof, except their trust in their forefathers who took this false path in the past, as well as, their lusts and desires to become leaders, and thereby gain honor and reverence for their forefathers,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!), meaning, Allah has sent them Messengers with the clear truth and unequivocal evidence. However, they did not adhere to or follow the guidance that came to them through the Prophets.</p><h2>Wishful Thinking does not earn One Righteousness</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَمْ لِلإِنسَـنِ مَا تَمَنَّى</p><p>(Or shall man have what he wishes), asserting that not everyone gets the goodness that he wishes,</p><p>لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(It will not be in accordance with desires (of Muslims), nor those of the People of Scripture.)(4:123) Allah says, not everyone who claims to be guided is truly guided, and not everyone gets what he wishes for himself. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا تَمَنَّى أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَنْظُرْ مَا يَتَمَنَّى، فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَدْرِي مَا يُكْتَبُ لَهُ مِنْ أُمْنِيَّتِه»</p><p>(When one of you wishes for something, let him be careful with what he wishes for, because he does not know what part of his wish will be written for him.)Only Ahmad collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَلِلَّهِ الاٌّخِرَةُ والاٍّولَى</p><p>(But to Allah belongs the last and the first.) meaning, all matters belong to Allah and He is the King and Owner of this world and the Hereafter, Who does what He will in both lives. Whatever He wills, occurs and whatever He does not will, never occurs.</p><h2>No Interecession except with Allah's Leave</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى</p><p>(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.) As He said;</p><p>مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p>(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission )(2:255) and,</p><p>وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ</p><p>(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) (34:23) `If this is the case with the angels who are close to Him, how can you, O ignorant ones, hope for Allah to grant you the intercession of the idols and rivals you worship with Him without having His permission or any divine legislation permitting you to worship them' Rather, Allah has forbidden idol worshipping by the tongues of all of His Messengers and He revealed this prohibition in all of His Books.</p>",

They sometimes commit minor sins, but they will be forgiven these minor sins and covered from exposure, as Allah mentioned in another Ayah;</p><p>إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَـتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلاً كَرِيماً</p><p>(If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance.)(4:31) Allah said here,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَـئِرَ الإِثْمِ وَالْفَوَحِشَ إِلاَّ اللَّمَمَ</p><p>(Those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) except Al-Lamam), Al-Lamam means, small faults and minor errors.

Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The eyes commit Zina by looking, the lips by kissing, the hands by transgressing, the feet by walking, and the sexual organ either materializes all of this or not. When one commits sexual intercourse, he will be someone who committed Zina. Otherwise, it is Al-Lamam.\" Masruq and Ash-Sha`bi also held the same view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Nafi`, who is also known as Ibn Lubabah At-Ta'ifi, said, \"I asked Abu Hurayrah about Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَّ اللَّمَمَ</p><p>(except the Lamam), and he said, `It pertains to kissing, winking one's eye, looking and embracing.

Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a Fatil.) (4:49) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata said, \"I called my daughter, Barrah (the pious one), and Zaynab bint Abu Salamah said to me, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade using this name. I was originally called Barrah and he said,</p><p>«لَا تُزَكُّوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ، إِنَّ اللهَ أَعْلَمُ بِأَهْلِ الْبِرِّ مِنْكُم»</p><p>(Do not ascribe purity to yourselves; Allah knows best who the pious people among you are)' They said, `What should we call her' He said,</p><p>«سَمُّوهَا زَيْنَب»</p><p>(Call her Zaynab.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded a Hadith from `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah, from his father who said, \"A man praised another man before the Prophet . The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَيْلَكَ قَطَعْتَ عُنُقَ صَاحِبِكَ مرارًا إِذَا كَانَ أَحَدُكُمْ مَادِحًا صَاحِبَهُ لَا مَحَالَةَ، فَلْيَقُلْ: أَحْسِبُ فُلَانًا وَاللهُ حَسِيبُهُ، وَلَا أُزَكِّي عَلَى اللهِ أَحَدًا، أَحْسِبُهُ كَذَا وَكَذَا، إِنْ كَانَ يَعْلَمُ ذلِك»</p><p>(Woe to you, you have cut off the neck of your friend! (He repeated this) If one of you must praise a friend of his, let him say, \"I think that so-and-so is this and that; Allah knows best about him and I will never purify anyone before Allah,\" if he knows his friend to be as he is describing him.)\" Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hammam bin Al-Harith said, \"A man came before `Uthman bin `Affan and praised him. Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad started throwing sand in the face of that man, saying, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered us to throw sand in their faces when we see those who praise.\"' Muslim and Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>Allah knows Every Matter, whether Small or Big, and He rewards Each according to His or Her Deeds</h2><p>Allah asserts that He is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and that He is independent of the need for anyone. He is the authority over His creation and rules them with justice. He created the creation in truth,</p><p>لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيِجْزِى الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِالْحُسْنَى</p><p>(that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best.) He recompenses each according to his or her deeds, good for good and evil for evil.</p><h2>Qualities of the Good-doers; Allah forgives the Small Faults</h2><p>Allah stated that the gooddoers are those who avoid major sins and immoral sins. They sometimes commit minor sins, but they will be forgiven these minor sins and covered from exposure, as Allah mentioned in another Ayah;</p><p>إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَـتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلاً كَرِيماً</p><p>(If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance.)(4:31) Allah said here,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَـئِرَ الإِثْمِ وَالْفَوَحِشَ إِلاَّ اللَّمَمَ</p><p>(Those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) except Al-Lamam), Al-Lamam means, small faults and minor errors. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I have not seen anything that resembles Al-Lamam better than the Hadith that Abu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet ,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى كَتَبَ عَلَى ابْنِ آدَمَ حَظَّهُ مِنَ الزِّنَا، أَدْرَكَ ذلِكَ لَا مَحَالَةَ، فَزِنَا الْعَيْنِ النَّظَرُ، وَزِنَا اللِّسَانِ النُّطْقُ، وَالنَّفْسُ تَتَمَنَّى وَتَشْتَهِي، وَالْفَرْجُ يُصِدِّقُ ذلِكَ أَوْ يُكَذِّبُه»</p><p>(Verily, Allah the Exalted has decreed for the Son of Adam his share of Zina and he will certainly earn his share. The Zina of the eye is by looking, the Zina of the tongue is by talking and the heart wishes and lusts, but the sexual organ either substantiates all this or not.)\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The eyes commit Zina by looking, the lips by kissing, the hands by transgressing, the feet by walking, and the sexual organ either materializes all of this or not. When one commits sexual intercourse, he will be someone who committed Zina. Otherwise, it is Al-Lamam.\" Masruq and Ash-Sha`bi also held the same view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Nafi`, who is also known as Ibn Lubabah At-Ta'ifi, said, \"I asked Abu Hurayrah about Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَّ اللَّمَمَ</p><p>(except the Lamam), and he said, `It pertains to kissing, winking one's eye, looking and embracing. When the sexual organ meets the sexual organ in intercourse then Ghusl is obligatory, and that is Zina.\"</p><h2>Encouraging Repentance and forbidding Claims of Purity for Oneself</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ وَسِعُ الْمَغْفِرَةِ</p><p>(verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness.) asserts that His Mercy encompasses everything, and His forgiveness entails every type of sin, if one repents,</p><p>قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لاَ تَقْنَطُواْ مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعاً إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p>(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against them- selves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah: verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (39:53) Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِذْ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He knows you well when He created you from the earth,) Allah says, `He was and still is the All-Knowing Whose knowledge encompasses your affairs, statements and all of the actions that will be committed by you, even when He created your father `Adam from the earth and took his offspring from his loin, as small as ants. He then divided them into two groups, a group destined for Paradise and a group to Hellfire,'</p><p>وَإِذْ أَنتُمْ أَجِنَّةٌ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَـتِكُمْ</p><p>(and when you were fetuses in your mothers' wombs.) when He commanded the angel to record one's provisions, age, actions and if he would be among the miserable or the happy. Allah said,</p><p>فَلاَ تُزَكُّواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ</p><p>(So, ascribe not purity to yourselves.) forbidding one from ascribing purity and praising himself and thinking highly of his actions,</p><p>هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ اتَّقَى</p><p>(He knows best him who has Taqwa.) Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ بَلِ اللَّهُ يُزَكِّى مَن يَشَآءُ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً</p><p>(Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves. Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a Fatil.) (4:49) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata said, \"I called my daughter, Barrah (the pious one), and Zaynab bint Abu Salamah said to me, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade using this name. I was originally called Barrah and he said,</p><p>«لَا تُزَكُّوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ، إِنَّ اللهَ أَعْلَمُ بِأَهْلِ الْبِرِّ مِنْكُم»</p><p>(Do not ascribe purity to yourselves; Allah knows best who the pious people among you are)' They said, `What should we call her' He said,</p><p>«سَمُّوهَا زَيْنَب»</p><p>(Call her Zaynab.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded a Hadith from `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah, from his father who said, \"A man praised another man before the Prophet . The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَيْلَكَ قَطَعْتَ عُنُقَ صَاحِبِكَ مرارًا إِذَا كَانَ أَحَدُكُمْ مَادِحًا صَاحِبَهُ لَا مَحَالَةَ، فَلْيَقُلْ: أَحْسِبُ فُلَانًا وَاللهُ حَسِيبُهُ، وَلَا أُزَكِّي عَلَى اللهِ أَحَدًا، أَحْسِبُهُ كَذَا وَكَذَا، إِنْ كَانَ يَعْلَمُ ذلِك»</p><p>(Woe to you, you have cut off the neck of your friend! (He repeated this) If one of you must praise a friend of his, let him say, \"I think that so-and-so is this and that; Allah knows best about him and I will never purify anyone before Allah,\" if he knows his friend to be as he is describing him.)\" Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hammam bin Al-Harith said, \"A man came before `Uthman bin `Affan and praised him. Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad started throwing sand in the face of that man, saying, `The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered us to throw sand in their faces when we see those who praise.\"' Muslim and Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>Chastising Those Who disobey Allah and stop giving Charity</h2><p>Allah the Exalted chastises those who turn away from His obedience,</p><p>فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(So he (the disbeliever) neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied and turned away!)(75:31-32),</p><p>وَأَعْطَى قَلِيلاً وَأَكْدَى</p><p>(And gave a little, then stopped) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Gave a little, then stopped giving.\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and several others. `Ikrimah and Sa`id said: \"Like the case of a people who dig a well, during the course of which they find a rock preventing them from completing their work. So they say, `We are finished' and they abandon the work.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>أَعِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ الْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰ</p><p>(Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees) means, does this person, who stopped giving for fear of poverty and ended his acts of charity have knowledge of the Unseen and thus knows that if he does not stop giving, his wealth will go away No. Such a person has stopped giving in charity for righteous causes and did not keep relations with kith and kin because of his miserliness, being stingy and out of fear of poverty. The Prophet said in a Hadith,</p><p>«أَنْفِقْ بِلَالُ، وَلَا تَخْشَ مِنْ ذِي الْعَرْشِ إِقْلَالًا»</p><p>(O Bilal, spend and fear not less provisions from the Owner of the Thone.) Allah the Exalted and Most honored said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah's cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers.)(34:39)</p><h2>The Meaning of `fulfilled</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِى صُحُفِ مُوسَى - وَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى</p><p>(Or is he not informed with what is in the Suhuf of Musa. And of Ibrahim who fulfilled), Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ath-Thawri said it means: \"Conveyed all that he was ordered to convey.\" Ibn `Abbas said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled) \"He delivered all that Allah ordered him to deliver.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled), \"What he was ordered.\" Qatadah said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled), \"He obeyed Allah and delivered His Message to His creatures.\" This is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir because it includes the statement before it and supports it. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</p><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled. He said: \"Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind.\")(2:124) Therefore, Ibrahim fulfilled all the commands of his Lord, stayed away from all the prohibitions, and conveyed Allah's Message in its entirety. Therefore, he is worthy of being made a leader for mankind in all of his affairs, statements and actions. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.\")(16:123)</p><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,</p><p>أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَزِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</p><p>(That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states</p><p>وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</p><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى</p><p>(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ الْإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِه»</p><p>(When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَطْيَبَ مَا أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِهِ، وَإِنَّ وَلَدَهُ مِنْ كَسْبِه»</p><p>(Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى</p><p>(And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَقُلِ اعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And say: \"Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.\")(9:105), Then Allah will remind you of your actions and recompense you for them in the best manner, good for good and evil for evil. Allah's statement here,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ الْجَزَآءَ الأَوْفَى</p><p>(Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.)</p>",
    "<h2>Chastising Those Who disobey Allah and stop giving Charity</h2><p>Allah the Exalted chastises those who turn away from His obedience,</p><p>فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(So he (the disbeliever) neither believed nor prayed!

So they say, `We are finished' and they abandon the work.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>أَعِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ الْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰ</p><p>(Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees) means, does this person, who stopped giving for fear of poverty and ended his acts of charity have knowledge of the Unseen and thus knows that if he does not stop giving, his wealth will go away No. Such a person has stopped giving in charity for righteous causes and did not keep relations with kith and kin because of his miserliness, being stingy and out of fear of poverty. The Prophet said in a Hadith,</p><p>«أَنْفِقْ بِلَالُ، وَلَا تَخْشَ مِنْ ذِي الْعَرْشِ إِقْلَالًا»</p><p>(O Bilal, spend and fear not less provisions from the Owner of the Thone.) Allah the Exalted and Most honored said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah's cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers.)(34:39)</p><h2>The Meaning of `fulfilled</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِى صُحُفِ مُوسَى - وَإِبْرَهِيمَ الَّذِى وَفَّى</p><p>(Or is he not informed with what is in the Suhuf of Musa. And of Ibrahim who fulfilled), Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ath-Thawri said it means: \"Conveyed all that he was ordered to convey.\" Ibn `Abbas said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled) \"He delivered all that Allah ordered him to deliver.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled), \"What he was ordered.\" Qatadah said about:</p><p>وَفَّى</p><p>(fulfilled), \"He obeyed Allah and delivered His Message to His creatures.\" This is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir because it includes the statement before it and supports it. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</p><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled. He said: \"Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind.\")(2:124) Therefore, Ibrahim fulfilled all the commands of his Lord, stayed away from all the prohibitions, and conveyed Allah's Message in its entirety. Therefore, he is worthy of being made a leader for mankind in all of his affairs, statements and actions. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.\")(16:123)</p><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,</p><p>أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَزِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</p><p>(That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states</p><p>وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</p><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى</p><p>(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ الْإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِه»</p><p>(When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَطْيَبَ مَا أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِهِ، وَإِنَّ وَلَدَهُ مِنْ كَسْبِه»</p><p>(Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى</p><p>(And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَقُلِ اعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And say: \"Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.\")(9:105), Then Allah will remind you of your actions and recompense you for them in the best manner, good for good and evil for evil. Allah's statement here,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ الْجَزَآءَ الأَوْفَى</p><p>(Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.)</p>",

Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): \"Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.\")(16:123)</p><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,</p><p>أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَزِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</p><p>(That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states</p><p>وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</p><p>(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى</p><p>(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ الْإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: مِنْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ، أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِه»</p><p>(When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَطْيَبَ مَا أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْ كَسْبِهِ، وَإِنَّ وَلَدَهُ مِنْ كَسْبِه»</p><p>(Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى وَنَكْتُبُ مَاَ قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَارَهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى</p><p>(And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَقُلِ اعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And say: \"Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.\")(9:105), Then Allah will remind you of your actions and recompense you for them in the best manner, good for good and evil for evil. Allah's statement here,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ الْجَزَآءَ الأَوْفَى</p><p>(Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.)</p>",
    "<h2>Chastising Those Who disobey Allah and stop giving Charity</h2><p>Allah the Exalted chastises those who turn away from His obedience,</p><p>فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(So he (the disbeliever) neither believed nor prayed!

So they say, `We are finished' and they abandon the work.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>أَعِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ الْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰ</p><p>(Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees) means, does this person, who stopped giving for fear of poverty and ended his acts of charity have knowledge of the Unseen and thus knows that if he does not stop giving, his wealth will go away No. Such a person has stopped giving in charity for righteous causes and did not keep relations with kith and kin because of his miserliness, being stingy and out of fear of poverty. The Prophet said in a Hadith,</p><p>«أَنْفِقْ بِلَالُ، وَلَا تَخْشَ مِنْ ذِي الْعَرْشِ إِقْلَالًا»</p><p>(O Bilal, spend and fear not less provisions from the Owner of the Thone.)

Allah said,</p><p>وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَـتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّى جَـعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا</p><p>(And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled.

A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ، مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى</p><p>(And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَقُلِ اعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَـلِمِ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And say: \"Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do.\")(9:105), Then Allah will remind you of your actions and recompense you for them in the best manner, good for good and evil for evil. Allah's statement here,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ الْجَزَآءَ الأَوْفَى</p><p>(Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.)</p>",
    "<h2>Some Attributes of the Lord, that He returns Man as He originated Him, and some of what He does with His Servants</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَأَنَّ إِلَى رَبِّكَ الْمُنتَهَى</p><p>(And that to your Lord is the End.) meaning, the return of everything on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Maymun Al-Awdi said, \"Once, Mu`adh bin Jabal stood up among us and said, `O Children of Awd! I am the emissary of Allah's Messenger ﷺ to you; know that the Return is to Allah, either to Paradise or the Fire.\"' Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَى</p><p>(And that it is He Who makes you laugh, and makes you weep.) means that He created in His creatures the ability to laugh or weep and the causes for each of these opposites,</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَمَاتَ وَأَحْيَا</p><p>(And that it is He Who causes death and gives life.) In a similar statement, Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِى خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَوةَ</p><p>(Who has created death and life.)(67:2) Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ خَلَقَ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى - مِن نُّطْفَةٍ إِذَا تُمْنَى</p><p>(And that He creates the pairs, male and female. From Nutfah when it is emitted.) as He said:</p><p>أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى - أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى - ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى - أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(Does man think that he will be left neglected Was he not a Nutfah Then he became an `Alaqah (something that clings); then (Allah) shaped and fashioned (him) in due proportion.

It is Allah Who gives wealth to His servants and this wealth remains with them. This means they are able to use it to their benefit, is this out of the completeness of His favor. Most of the statements of the scholars of Tafsir revolve around this meaning, such as those from Abu Salih, Ibn Jarir and others. Mujahid said that,</p><p>أَغْنَى</p><p>(Aghna) meaning: He gives wealth.</p><p>وَأَقْنَى</p><p>(Aqna) meaning: He gives servants. Similar was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid said;</p><p>أَغْنَى</p><p>(Aghna) means: He granted; while,</p><p>وَأَقْنَى</p><p>(Aqna) means: He gave contentment.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ رَبُّ الشِّعْرَى</p><p>(And that He is the Lord of Ash-Shi`ra.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said about Ash-Shi`ra that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الاٍّولَى</p><p>(And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) the people of Hud.

Allah's statement that whatever has covered it, has covered it, is like the case with the stones of Sijjil that He sent on them,</p><p>وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ الْمُنذَرِينَ</p><p>(And We rained on them a rain (of torment).

Ibn Jurayj said that the Ayah,</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ آلاءِ رَبِّكَ تَتَمَارَى</p><p>(Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt), is directed towards the Prophet saying: \"O Muhammad!\" However, the first ex- planation is better, and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred.</p>",

The Prophet used to recite these two Surahs during major gatherings and occasions because they contain Allah's promises and warnings, and information about the origin of creation, Resurrection, Tawhid, the affirmation of prophethood, and so forth among the great objectives.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour draws near; the cleaving of the Moon</h2><p>Allah informs about the approach of the Last Hour and the imminent end and demise of the world,</p><p>أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</p><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it.)(16:1),</p><p>اقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَـبُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness.)(21:1)</p><h2>Hadiths about the Last Hour</h2><p>There are several Hadiths with this meaning. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a speech to his Companions, saying,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْهَا إِلَّا كَمَا بَقِيَ مِنْ يَوْمِكُمْ هذَا فِيمَا مَضَى مِنْه»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul!

    "<h2>The Destination of the Criminals</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><p>ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><p>وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,</p><p>«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»</p><p>(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»</p><p>(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»</p><p>(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»</p><p>(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,</p><p>وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ</p><p>(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"</p><h2>A Warning to beware of Allah's Threats</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ</p><p>(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) This is information about the execution of His will in His creation, just as He informed us the execution of His decree in them,</p><p>وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ</p><p>(And Our commandment is but one) meaning, `We only command a thing once, without needing to repeat the command; and whatever We command comes to existence faster than the blinking of an eye without any delay, not even for an instant.' Allah said,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَآ أَشْيَـعَكُمْ</p><p>(And indeed, We have destroyed your likes), i.e. the earlier nations who denied their Messengers,</p><p>فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ</p><p>(then is there any that will remember) meaning, is there any that will receive admonition by remembering the humiliation and torment that Allah decreed for them</p><p>وَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَـعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ</p><p>(And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, as was done in the past with the people of their kind.)(34:54) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ</p><p>(And everything they have done is noted in Az-Zubur.) meaning, everything they did is recorded in the Books of Record entrusted to the angels, peace be upon them,</p><p>وَكُلُّ صَغِيرٍ وَكَبِيرٍ</p><p>(And everything, small and large,) meaning, of their actions,</p><p>مُّسْتَطَرٌ</p><p>(is written down.) everything that they do is recorded and written in their Record of deeds, which leave nothing, whether large or small, but it is recorded and counted. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»</p><p>(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.</p><h2>The Good End for Those with Taqwa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,</p><p>فِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ</p><p>(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,</p><p>عِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ</p><p>(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»</p><p>(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.)

    "<h2>The Destination of the Criminals</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><p>ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><p>وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,</p><p>«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»</p><p>(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.\"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, \" `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»</p><p>(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»</p><p>(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.\"' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»</p><p>(Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,</p><p>وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَآءِ</p><p>(And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: \"Hasan, Sahih Gharib.\"</p><h2>A Warning to beware of Allah's Threats</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ</p><p>(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)

Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»</p><p>(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.</p><h2>The Good End for Those with Taqwa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,</p><p>فِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ</p><p>(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,</p><p>عِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ</p><p>(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for.

    "<h2>The Destination of the Criminals</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><p>ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><p>وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).) (25:2) and,</p><p>سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى - الَّذِى خَلَقَ فَسَوَّى - وَالَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَى</p><p>(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: \"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,</p><p>«نَزَلَتْ فِي أُنَاسٍ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَكُونُونَ فِي آخِرِ الزَّمَانِ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِقَدَرِ الله»</p><p>(These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ - إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\" Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die.

Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«سَيَكُونُ فِي أُمَّتِي أَقْوَامٌ يُكَذِّبُونَ بِالْقَدَر»</p><p>(There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)\" Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»</p><p>(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا خَلَقَ اللهُ الْقَلَمُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ: اكْتُبْ، فَجَرَى فِي تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ بِمَا هُوَ كَائِنٌ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.)

Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»</p><p>(O `A'ishah!

    "<h2>The Destination of the Criminals</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><p>ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><p>وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).)

Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar.

Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn.

Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you.

    "<h2>The Destination of the Criminals</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the criminals are misguided away from the truth and engulfed in confusion, because of the doubts and uncertainty they are in. This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire), meaning, just as they were consumed in doubt, suspicion and hesitation, they ended up in the Fire. And just as they were misguided, they will end up being dragged on their faces, unaware of where they will be taken. They will be admonished and criticized,</p><p>ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>(\"Taste you the touch of Hell!\")</p><h2>Everything was created with Qadar</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) is similar to several other Ayat,</p><p>وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً</p><p>(He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements (Faqaddarahu Taqdir).)

Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ arguing with him and discounting the Qadar.

Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, \"These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ وَسُعُرٍ - يَوْمَ يُسْحَبُونَ فِى النَّارِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ ذُوقُواْ مَسَّ سَقَرَ</p><p>إِنَّا كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقْنَـهُ بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn.

They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, \"I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah!

They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die.

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ بِقَدَرٍ حَتْى الْعَجْزُ وَالْكَيْس»</p><p>(Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«اسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ وَلَا تَعْجَزْ، فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ أَمْرٌ فَقُلْ: قَدَّرَ اللهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ، وَلَا تَقُلْ: لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا لَكَانَ كَذَا، فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, \"Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.\" Do not say, \"Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because \"if\" opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)\" In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ لَكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ، لَمْ يَكْتُبْهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ، جَفَّتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَطُوِيَتِ الصُّحُف»</p><p>(Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, \"I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you.

Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِيَّاكِ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ، فَإِنَّ لَهَا مِنَ اللهِ طَالِبًا»</p><p>(O `A'ishah! Beware of small sins, because there is someone assigned by Allah who records them.) An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.</p><h2>The Good End for Those with Taqwa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَهَرٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who have Taqwa, will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers.), unlike the end that the miserable are facing, loss, confusion and being dragged in the Fire on their faces, as well as being disgraced, punished and threatened. Allah said,</p><p>فِى مَقْعَدِ صِدْقٍ</p><p>(In a seat of truth,) in the Dwelling of Allah's honor, encompassed by His pleasure, favors, bounties, generosity and compassion,</p><p>عِندَ مَلِيكٍ مُّقْتَدِرِ</p><p>(near the Muqtadir King.) meaning with the Magnificent King Who created everything and measured its destiny; He is able to grant them whatever they wish and ask for. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«الْمُقْسِطُونَ عِنْدَ اللهِ عَلَى مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الرَّحْمنِ وَكِلْتَا يَدَيْهِ يَمِينٌ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا»</p><p>(Verily, the just will be with Allah on podiums of light, to the right of Ar-Rahman, and both of His Hands are right. They are those who are just and fair in their judgement and with their families and those whom they are responsible for.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.</p><p>This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him.</p>",
    "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Zirr said that a man said to Ibn Mas`ud: \"How is this recited: \"Ma'in Ghayri Yasin or Asin\" He asked him, \"Are you that proficient in reciting the whole Qur'an\" He replied, \"I recite the Mufassal section in one Rak`ah.\" So he said, \"Woe to you! Do you recite the Qur'an in haste, as if it is poetry I know that the Prophet used to recite two Surahs from the beginning of the Mufassal section (in one Rak`ah).\" And Ibn Mas`ud considered Surat Ar-Rahman to be the beginning of the Mufassal section.

Allah said,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ</p><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that in,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ</p><p>(And also corn, with (its) `Asf), `Asf means straw.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"`Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called `Asf when it dries out.\" Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that `Asf means straw. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves. The meanings here, and Allah knows best, are the various crops that produce straw, such as wheat and barley, and Rayhan are the leaves that grow on the stems.</p><h2>Mankind is surrounded by Allah's Favors</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَالْحَبُّ ذُو الْعَصْفِ وَالرَّيْحَانُ</p><p>(13. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p><p>meaning, \"O mankind and Jinn,which of the favors that Allah has given to you do you deny\" Muj ahid and others said this, and itis apparent when one reads what comes af ter it . Meaning the favors that are obvious to youwhile you are surrounded by them, you cannot deny or rej ect them. So we say, just as thebelievers among the Jinns said, \"O Allah! None of Your favors do we deny. All praise is due toYou. \" Ibn ` Abbas used to say, \"Nay, our Lord! \" meaning, \"None of Your favors do we deny. \"</p>",
    "<h2>The Creation of Humans and Jinns</h2><p>Allah mentions that He created mankind from clay, like that used in pottery, and created the Jinns from the tip of the flame of a smokeless fire. This was said by Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas. It was also said by `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"From the best part of the fire, from its smokeless flame.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«خُلِقَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ نُورٍ، وَخُلِقَ الْجَانُّ مِنْ مَارِجٍ مِنْ نَارٍ، وَخُلِقَ آدَمُ مِمَّا وُصِفَ لَكُم»</p><p>(The angels were created from light, the Jinns from a smokeless flame of fire, and `Adam from what was described to you.) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement:</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) was explained above.</p><h2>Allah is the Lord of the Two Easts and the Two Wests</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ</p><p>((He is) the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests.) meaning the sunrise of summer and winter and the sunset of summer and winter. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَـرِقِ وَالْمَغَـرِبِ</p><p>(So, I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west.)(70:40), referring to the different places from which the sun rises and then sets on people every day. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً</p><p>(The Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him alone as a trustee.)(73:9), referring to the different places of sunrise and sunset and the benefits that this variation brings to the created, mankind and Jinns,</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p><h2>Allah created Different Types of Water</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ</p><p>(He has Maraja the two seas), or let them loose, according to Ibn `Abbas. Allah's statement,</p><p>يَلْتَقِيَانِ</p><p>(meeting together.) Ibn Zayd said, \"He prevents them from meeting by the dividing barrier He placed between them to separate them.\" The two seas are the fresh and salty waters, the former coming from running rivers. We discussed this topic in Surat Al-Furqan when explaining Allah's statement;</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخاً وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً</p><p>(And it is He Who has let free the two seas: one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter; and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.)(25:53) Allah said,</p><p>بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لاَّ يَبْغِيَانِ</p><p>(Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress.) meaning, He has placed a barrier of land between these two types of waters, so that they do not transgress upon each other, which would spoil the characteristics they were created with. Allah said,</p><p>يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا الُّلؤْلُؤُ وَالمَرْجَانُ</p><p>(Out of them both come out pearls and Al-Marjan. ) pearls are well-known. As for Marjan they say it means small pearls. Mujahid, Qatadah, Abu Ruzayn, Ad-Dahhak said it, and it has also been reported from `Ali. It was also said that it means large, precious pearls, this was mentioned by Ibn Jarir from some of the Salaf. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"When it rains, the oysters in the sea open their mouths. What falls in them, the drops, turns into pearls.\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih. Since this type of adornment is a favor from Allah to the people of earth, He reminded them of it,</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>وَلَهُ الْجَوَارِ الْمُنشَئَاتُ</p><p>(And His are Al-Jawar Al-Munsha'at), meaning the ships that float,</p><p>فِى الْبَحْرِ</p><p>(in the seas), Mujahid said, \"Whatever ship hoists a sail, it is from Munsha'at, if it does not hoist a sail, it is not from the Munsha'at.\" Qatadah said, \"Al-Munsha'at means created.\" Others said that it is Al-Munshi'at meaning, \"launched.\"</p><p>كَالاٌّعْلَـمِ</p><p>(like A`lam.) This means, they are like mountains with their great size, and it also refers to the trade and commercial services they make possible, transporting cargo from one area to another and from one province to another.

    "<h2>The Delight of Those Who have Taqwa in Paradise</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ</p><p>(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord,) on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَى</p><p>(And restrained himself from the desires.) (79:40), and does not indulge nor prefer this worldly life. He who knows that the Hereafter is better and more lasting, so he fulfills what his Lord ordered him and stays away from His prohibitions, then he will earn two gardens from his Lord on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«جَنَّتَانِ مِنْ فِضَّةٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَجَنَّتَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ آنِيَتُهُمَا وَمَا فِيهِمَا، وَمَا بَيْنَ الْقَوْمِ وَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَّا رِدَاءُ الْكِبْرِيَاءِ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ فِي جَنَّةِ عَدْن»</p><p>(There are two gardens made of silver -- their vessels and all that they contain. And there are two gardens made of gold -- their vessels and all that they contain. And nothing stands between the people in the `Adn Garden and looking at their Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored, but the covering of pride before His Face.) The Group, with the exception of Abu Dawud, collected this via the Hadith of `Abdul-`Aziz. This Ayah is general and applies to both humans and Jinns, providing proof that those among the Jinns who believe and have Taqwa will enter Paradise, for Allah is reminding the Ath-Thaqalayn of this favor, as He says;</p><p>وَلِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ جَنَّتَانِ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will be two Gardens.

Abu `Imran Al-Jawni said, \"It is thick silk embroidered with gold.\" In this way, the honor of the outside is alluded to by mentioning the honor of the inside. Abu Ishaq narrated that Hubayrah bin Yarim said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"This is their interior, so what about it if you see their exterior\" Allah said,</p><p>وَجَنَى الْجَنَّتَيْنِ دَانٍ</p><p>(and the fruits of the two Gardens will be near at hand.) close to the believers who will be able to take any of it they wish, whether they are reclining or otherwise,</p><p>قُطُوفُهَا دَانِيَةٌ</p><p>(The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.)(69:23),</p><p>وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَـلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً</p><p>(And the shade thereof is. close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)(76:14), meaning, these fruits descend from their branches to those who wish to have them, because they are close at hand,</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) After Allah mentioned the couches, He then said,</p><p>فِيهِنَّ</p><p>(Wherein will be), meaning on these couches or beds,</p><p>قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ</p><p>(Qasirat At-Tarf) chaste females, wives restraining their glances, desiring none except their husbands, seeing them as the most beautiful men in Paradise. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibn Zayd. It was reported that one of these wives will say to her husband, \"By Allah! I neither see anything in Paradise more handsome than you nor more beloved to me than you.

This is also a proof that the believers among the Jinns will enter Paradise. Artat bin Al-Mundhir said, \"Damrah bin Habib was asked if the Jinns will enter Paradise and he said, `Yes, and they will get married. The Jinns will have Jinn women and the humans will have female humans.\"' Allah's statement,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(whom never deflowered a human before nor Jinn.

Imam Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"Some people either boasted or just wondered who are more in Paradise, men or women. Abu Hurayrah said, `Has not Abu Al-Qasim (Muhammad  ﷺ) said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ زُمْرَةٍ تَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّتِي تَلِيهَا عَلَى (أَضْوَءِ) كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ، لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ اثْنَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سُوقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ، وَمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَعْزَب»</p><p>(Verily, the first group that will enter Paradise will look like the moon when it is full, and the next batch will be as radiant as the radiant star in the sky.

Abu Ishaq narrated that Hubayrah bin Yarim said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"This is their interior, so what about it if you see their exterior\" Allah said,</p><p>وَجَنَى الْجَنَّتَيْنِ دَانٍ</p><p>(and the fruits of the two Gardens will be near at hand.) close to the believers who will be able to take any of it they wish, whether they are reclining or otherwise,</p><p>قُطُوفُهَا دَانِيَةٌ</p><p>(The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.)(69:23),</p><p>وَدَانِيَةً عَلَيْهِمْ ظِلَـلُهَا وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا تَذْلِيلاً</p><p>(And the shade thereof is. close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)(76:14), meaning, these fruits descend from their branches to those who wish to have them, because they are close at hand,</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) After Allah mentioned the couches, He then said,</p><p>فِيهِنَّ</p><p>(Wherein will be), meaning on these couches or beds,</p><p>قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ</p><p>(Qasirat At-Tarf) chaste females, wives restraining their glances, desiring none except their husbands, seeing them as the most beautiful men in Paradise. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibn Zayd. It was reported that one of these wives will say to her husband, \"By Allah! I neither see anything in Paradise more handsome than you nor more beloved to me than you. So praise be to Allah Who made you for me and made me for you.\" Allah said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(whom never deflowered a human before nor Jinn ) meaning they are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands. This is also a proof that the believers among the Jinns will enter Paradise. Artat bin Al-Mundhir said, \"Damrah bin Habib was asked if the Jinns will enter Paradise and he said, `Yes, and they will get married. The Jinns will have Jinn women and the humans will have female humans.\"' Allah's statement,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(whom never deflowered a human before nor Jinn. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Then Allah describes these women for the proposed:</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ الْيَاقُوتُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ</p><p>(they are like Yaqut and Marjan.) Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Zayd and others said, \"They are as pure as rubies and white as Marjan.\" So here they described Marjan as pearls. Imam Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"Some people either boasted or just wondered who are more in Paradise, men or women. Abu Hurayrah said, `Has not Abu Al-Qasim (Muhammad  ﷺ) said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ زُمْرَةٍ تَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّتِي تَلِيهَا عَلَى (أَضْوَءِ) كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ، لِكُلِّ امْرِىءٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ اثْنَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سُوقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ، وَمَا فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَعْزَب»</p><p>(Verily, the first group that will enter Paradise will look like the moon when it is full, and the next batch will be as radiant as the radiant star in the sky. Each one of them will marry two wives. The marrow of the bones of their shins will be seen through the flesh. None will be unmarried in Paradise.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَغَدْوَةٌ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ أَوْ رَوْحَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، وَلَقَابُ قَوسِ أَحَدِكُمْ، أَوْ مَوْضِعُ قِدِّهِ يَعْنِي سَوْطَهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، وَلَوِ اطَّلَعَتِ امْرَأَةٌ مِنْ نِسَاءِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ لَمَلَأَتْ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا رِيحًا، وَلَطَابَ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا، وَلَنَصِيفُهَا عَلَى رَأْسِهَا خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(A morning or an evening journey in Allah's cause is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. And a place in Paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you, is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. If one of the women of the people of Paradise looks directly at the earth, she will fill what is between Paradise and earth with a good scent and all of it will become delightful. Verily, the veil over her head is better than this life and all that is on its surface.) Al-Bukhari also collected a similar narration. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ</p><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) Allah declares that in the Hereafter, all that is good and righteous is the only befitting reward for those who do good deeds in this life,</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is best (reward) and even more.)(10:26) All of these are tremendous blessings that cannot be earned merely by good deeds, but by Allah's favor and bounty, after all of these He says;</p><p>فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</p>",
    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ</p><p>(In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free)), while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,</p><p>نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p>(Naddakhatan); `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"It means gushing. And the free flowing is stronger than gushing.\" Ad-Dahhak said that,</p><p>نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p>(gushing forth) means, they are full of water and constantly gushing. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا مِن كُلِّ فَـكِهَةٍ زَوْجَانِ</p><p>(In them (both) will be every kind of fruit in pairs), but He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا فَـكِهَةٌ وَنَخْلٌ وَرُمَّانٌ</p><p>(In them (both) will be fruits, and date palms and pomegranates.) There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p>فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p>(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah. It was also said that Khayrat is plural of Khayrah and it is a righteous, well-mannered, beautiful woman, according to the majority of scholars, and it is also reported from Umm Salamah as a Hadith from the Prophet . There is another Hadith saying that Al-Hur Al-`Ayn will sing,</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْخَيْرَاتُ الْحِسَانُ، خُلِقْنَا لِأَزْوَاجٍ كِرَام»</p><p>(\"We are Al-Khayrat Al-Hisan, we were created for honorable husbands.\") Allah said:</p><p>حُورٌ مَّقْصُورَتٌ فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(Hur (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions;) but He said about the first two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِنَّ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ</p><p>(Wherein both will be Qasirat At-Tarf,) There is no doubt that the chaste wives that restrain their glances themselves, are better than those guarded in pavilions even though both are secluded. About Allah's saying:</p><p>فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُون»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before. Allah added in the description of the first group of the believers' wives,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ الْيَاقُوتُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ فَبِأَىِّ ءَالاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p>(they are like Yaqut (rubies) and Marjan (pearls). Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَى رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets.

In a Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْه»</p><p>(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(Persist (in invoking Allah) with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).\") An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith.

There is another Hadith saying that Al-Hur Al-`Ayn will sing,</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْخَيْرَاتُ الْحِسَانُ، خُلِقْنَا لِأَزْوَاجٍ كِرَام»</p><p>(\"We are Al-Khayrat Al-Hisan, we were created for honorable husbands.\") Allah said:</p><p>حُورٌ مَّقْصُورَتٌ فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(Hur (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions;) but He said about the first two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِنَّ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ</p><p>(Wherein both will be Qasirat At-Tarf,) There is no doubt that the chaste wives that restrain their glances themselves, are better than those guarded in pavilions even though both are secluded. About Allah's saying:</p><p>فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُون»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before.

Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَى رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets.

In a Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْه»</p><p>(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(Persist (in invoking Allah) with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).\") An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith.

    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter.

Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling.

About Allah's saying:</p><p>فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُون»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before.

Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَى رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets. Allah said,</p><p>تَبَـرَكَ اسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Blessed be the Name of your Lord (Allah) Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram,) Allah states that He is Worthy of being honored and always obeyed, revered and thus worshipped, appreciated and never unappreciated, and remembered and never forgotten. `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,</p><p>ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram) means, the Owner of greatness and pride. In a Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْه»</p><p>(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(Persist (in invoking Allah) with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).\") An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that `A'ishah said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would (say the) Salam (completing prayer), he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلَامُ، تَبَارَكْتَ يَاذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(O Allah!

    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ</p><p>(In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free)), while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,</p><p>نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p>(Naddakhatan); `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"It means gushing.

There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p>فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p>(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah.

About Allah's saying:</p><p>فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُون»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before.

Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَى رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets. Allah said,</p><p>تَبَـرَكَ اسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Blessed be the Name of your Lord (Allah) Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram,) Allah states that He is Worthy of being honored and always obeyed, revered and thus worshipped, appreciated and never unappreciated, and remembered and never forgotten. `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,</p><p>ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram) means, the Owner of greatness and pride. In a Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْه»</p><p>(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(Persist (in invoking Allah) with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).\") An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that `A'ishah said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would (say the) Salam (completing prayer), he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلَامُ، تَبَارَكْتَ يَاذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(O Allah!

    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ</p><p>(In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free)), while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,</p><p>نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p>(Naddakhatan); `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"It means gushing.

There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p>فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p>(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah.

About Allah's saying:</p><p>فِى الْخِيَامِ</p><p>(in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُون»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَى بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا»</p><p>(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلاَ جَآنٌّ</p><p>(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before.

Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,</p><p>مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَى رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَبْقَرِىٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p>(and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets. Allah said,</p><p>تَبَـرَكَ اسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Blessed be the Name of your Lord (Allah) Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram,) Allah states that He is Worthy of being honored and always obeyed, revered and thus worshipped, appreciated and never unappreciated, and remembered and never forgotten. `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,</p><p>ذِى الْجَلَـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ</p><p>(Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram) means, the Owner of greatness and pride. In a Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْه»</p><p>(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(Persist (in invoking Allah) with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).\") An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that `A'ishah said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would (say the) Salam (completing prayer), he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلَامُ، تَبَارَكْتَ يَاذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَام»</p><p>(O Allah!

    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p>فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ</p><p>(In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free)), while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,</p><p>نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p>(Naddakhatan); `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"It means gushing.

There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p>فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p>(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah.

In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide.

    "<h2>These two gardens are lower, in virtue and in status than the two before them, as supported in the Qur'an.</h2><p>Allah said:</p><p>وَمِن دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p>(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\" There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter.

And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p>ذَوَاتَآ أَفْنَانٍ</p><p>(With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said:</p><p>مُدْهَآمَّتَانِ</p><p>(Mudhammatan) \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling.

There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p>فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p>(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah.

Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) meaning, it is shaken and moved violently over all of its surface and through its depths. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said about Allah's saying:,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) it means \"Violently shaken.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"The earth will be shaken with all that is in it, just as a sifter is shaken with its contents.\" This is like Allah's saying:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>(When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(O mankind!

This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others.

This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><p>فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose.

The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged.

It also elevates others to the highest grades in the residence of eternal delight, even if they were weak in this life. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>خَافِضَةٌ رَّافِعَةٌ</p><p>(Bringing low, exalting), \"It made the near and the far hear it,\" while `Ikrimah said, \"It lowered, and thus those who were close heard it, and elevated, and thus those in the distance heard it.\" Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said similarly. Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) meaning, it is shaken and moved violently over all of its surface and through its depths. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said about Allah's saying:,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) it means \"Violently shaken.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"The earth will be shaken with all that is in it, just as a sifter is shaken with its contents.\" This is like Allah's saying:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>(When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(O mankind!

This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others.

This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection. Some will on the right of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><p>فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.)(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost.) is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ</p><p>(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</p>",

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said about Allah's saying:,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) it means \"Violently shaken.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"The earth will be shaken with all that is in it, just as a sifter is shaken with its contents.\" This is like Allah's saying:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>(When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(O mankind!

This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others.

This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><p>فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose.

The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged.

At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said, \"Hasan Gharib.\"</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Horrors of the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Al-Waqi`ah (the occurrence), is one of the names of the Day of Resurrection, because that Day is real and will surely come. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p><p>فَيَوْمَئِذٍ وَقَعَتِ الْوَاقِعَةُ</p><p>(Then on that Day shall the Waqi`ah occur.)( 69:15) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَيْسَ لِوَقْعَتِهَا كَاذِبَةٌ</p><p>(There is not, for its occurrence, Kadhibah.) means, when He commands the Day of Resurrection to begin, none can stop it from happening or prevent it from beginning,</p><p>اسْتَجِيبُواْ لِرَبِّكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ مَرَدَّ لَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Answer the call of your Lord before there comes from Allah a Day which can not be averted.) (42:47),</p><p>سَأَلَ سَآئِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ - لِّلْكَـفِرِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُ دَافِعٌ</p><p>(A questioner asked concerning a torment about to occur -- upon the disbelievers, which none can avert.)(70:1-2),</p><p>وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُن فَيَكُونُ قَوْلُهُ الْحَقُّ وَلَهُ الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِى الصُّوَرِ عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْخَبِيرُ</p><p>(And on the Day He will say: \"Be!\" -- and it is! His Word is the Truth. His will be the dominion on the Day when the Trumpet will be blown. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the All-Wise, Well Aware.)(6:73) As for the meaning of</p><p>كَاذِبَةٌ</p><p>(Kadhibah) Muhammad bin Ka`b said: \"It will certainly occur,\" while Qatadah said, \"It shall not be discontinued, taken back or aborted. Allah's statement,</p><p>خَافِضَةٌ رَّافِعَةٌ</p><p>(Bringing low, exalting.) indicates that Al-Waqi`ah lowers some people to the lowest parts of the Fire, even if they had been mighty in this life. It also elevates others to the highest grades in the residence of eternal delight, even if they were weak in this life. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>خَافِضَةٌ رَّافِعَةٌ</p><p>(Bringing low, exalting), \"It made the near and the far hear it,\" while `Ikrimah said, \"It lowered, and thus those who were close heard it, and elevated, and thus those in the distance heard it.\" Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said similarly. Allah said,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) meaning, it is shaken and moved violently over all of its surface and through its depths. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said about Allah's saying:,</p><p>إِذَا رُجَّتِ الاٌّرْضُ رَجّاً</p><p>(When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) it means \"Violently shaken.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, \"The earth will be shaken with all that is in it, just as a sifter is shaken with its contents.\" This is like Allah's saying:</p><p>إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا</p><p>(When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord! Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.)(22:1). Allah said:</p><p>وَبُسَّتِ الْجِبَالُ بَسّاً</p><p>(And the mountains will be powdered to dust,) meaning, relentlessly pulverized. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others. Ibn Zayd said: \"The mountains will become just like Allah described them,</p><p>كَثِيباً مَّهِيلاً</p><p>(A heap of sand poured out.)(73:14).\" Allah's saying:</p><p>فَكَانَتْ هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(So that they will become floating dust particles.) Abu Ishaq narrated from Al-Harith, from `Ali: \"It will become like the rising dust storm that soon fades away leaving no trace of itself behind.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about Allah's saying:</p><p>فَكَانَتْ هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(So that they will become floating dust particles.) \"It describes the rising embers from the fire when it is kindled, but when the embers land, they are extinguished quickly.\" `Ikrimah said, \"The floating dust particles that the wind scatters all around,\" while Qatadah said,</p><p>هَبَآءً مُّنبَثّاً</p><p>(floating particles), \"Like the dry parts of trees that the wind scatters all about.\" This Ayah is similar to several other Ayat that indicate that the mountains will be moved from their places, demolished and blown off their bases, becoming like carded wool on the Day of Resurrection.</p><h2>Three Categories of People on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجاً ثَلَـثَةً</p><p>(And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection. Some will on the right of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,</p><p>فَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْمَشْـَمَةِ - وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p><p>ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.)(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost.) is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ</p><p>(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",

In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not.

I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition.

    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.)

However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise.

In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.)

Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.

So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.) Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using this chain of narration. Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls. We mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p>كَأَنَّهُنَّ بَيْضٌ مَّكْنُونٌ</p><p>(As if they were eggs preserved.)(37:49), in Surat As-Saffat (chapter 37), and also their description in Surat Ar-Rahman (chapter 55). This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).' Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw (evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace,)! Salaman (peace.)!\") meaning they will not hear foul or unnecessary speech in Paradise.</p><p>لاَّ تَسْمَعُ فِيهَا لَـغِيَةً</p><p>(Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) (88:11), meaning, no foul words are uttered therein. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً</p><p>(nor any sinful speech.) meaning, nor speech that contains foul words,</p><p>إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(But only the saying of: \"Salaman (peace!), Salaman (peace!).\"), they will greet each other with Salam, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(Their greeting therin will be: \"Salaman (peace!).\") (14:23) And, as we mentioned, their words will be free from impure and needless speech.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of the Foremost in Faith</h2><p>Allah states that the foremost of the close believers are a multitude, a crowd among the earlier generations and a few from the latter generations. There is a difference over the meaning of the first generations and the later generations. Some said that the former means earlier (believing) nations, while the later refers to this Ummah. This was reported from Mujahid and Al-Hasan Al-Basri, in the collection of Ibn Abi Hatim, and this is the preference of Ibn Jarir. He considered it supported by the saying of Allah's Messenger ﷺ:</p><p>«نَحْنُ الْاخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(We are the later nation, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection.) Ibn Jarir did not mention any other interpretation nor did he attribute this view to anyone else. There is another Hadith that could support this meaning. Imam Abu Muhammad bin Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when these Ayat were revealed,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), this news became hard for the Companions of the Prophet . These this Ayat,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a multitude of those will be from the later ones.), were revealed. The Prophet then said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، بَلْ أَنْتُمْ نِصْفُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْ: شَطْرُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَتُقَاسِمُونَهُمُ النِّصْفَ الثَّانِي»</p><p>(I hope that you will comprise a quarter of the residents of Paradise, a third of the residents of Paradise. Rather, you are a half of the residents of Paradise, and will have a share in the other half.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this. However, this opinion that Ibn Jarir chose is questionable, rather it is a deficient interpretation. This is because this Ummah is the best of all nations, according to the text of the Qur'an. Therefore, it is not possible that the foremost believers from earlier nations are more numerous than those of in this Ummah; the opposite is true. The latter opinion is the correct one, that,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones), refers to the earlier generations of this Ummah, while,</p><p>وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And a few of those will be from the later ones.), refers to the latter people of this Ummah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that As-Sari bin Yahya said that Al-Hasan recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالسَّـبِقُونَ السَّـبِقُونَ - أُوْلَـئِكَ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And those foremost will be foremost. These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight. A multitude of those will be from the first ones.), Then he commented, \"A multitude from the earlier generation of this Ummah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Muhammad bin Sirin commented:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ - وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first ones. And a few of those will be from the later ones.), \"They stated, or hoped that they will all be from this Ummah.\" Therefore, these are the statements of Al-Hasan and Ibn Sirin that those foremost in faith are all from this Ummah. There is no doubt that the earlier generations of each nation were better than the latter generations. In this pretext, this Ayah might include all previous believing nations. In this regard, it is confirmed in the authentic Hadith compilations, from more than one route, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«خَيْرُ الْقُرُونِ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُم»</p><p>(The best people are my generation, then the next generation, then the next generation....) He also said:</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ، لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُمْ وَلَا مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ، إِلَى قِيَامِ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(A group of my Ummah will always remain on the truth and dominant, unharmed by those who fail to support them and those who defy them, until the Last Hour begins.) In another narration:</p><p>«حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ تَعَالَى وَهُمْ كَذلِك»</p><p>(..until Allah's command comes while they are like this.) This Ummah is more honored than any other Ummah. The foremost believers of this Ummah are more numerous and hold a higher rank than those of other nations, due to the status of their religion and Prophet. In a Mutawatir Hadith, the Prophet mentioned that seventy thousand of this Ummah will enter Paradise without reckoning. In another narration of this Hadith, the Prophet added,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With each thousand, another seventy thousand.) In yet another narration, he said,</p><p>«مَعَ كُلِّ وَاحِدٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا»</p><p>(With every one of them is another seventy thousand.) Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى سُرُرٍ مَّوْضُونَةٍ</p><p>(on Thrones, Mawdunah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Woven with gold.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Allah said,</p><p>مُّتَّكِئِينَ عَلَيْهَا مُتَقَـبِلِينَ</p><p>(Reclining thereon, face to face.) indicating that they will face each other, and none of them will be in the back lines,</p><p>يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ</p><p>(Immortal boys will go around them), who will never grow up, get old or change in shape,</p><p>بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ</p><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine) these cups do not have handles or spouts, while the jugs sometimes do and sometimes do not. All of them, including the glasses, will contain wine drawn from a flowing spring, not from containers that might get empty. Rather, this spring of wine flows freely,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un nor Yunzifun.) meaning, they will never get headaches from this wine nor intoxicated. Rather, this wine does not affect their minds, even though it has a strong and tremendously delightful taste. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"The wine (of this life) has four side-effects, it intoxicates, gives headaches, induces vomiting and causes excessive urine. So Allah mentioned the wine of Paradise free of these characteristics.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا</p><p>(Wherefrom neither Yusadda`un) means, \"It does not give them a headache.\" While they said that</p><p>وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(nor will they Yunzifun. ) means that \"It does not change their sense of reasoning.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ مِّمَّا يَتَخَيَّرُونَ - وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with fruit that they may choose. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) meaning, whatever fruits they wish for will be distributed among them. This Ayah is a proof that we are allowed to choose the fruits that we prefer and wish to eat. Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ liked dreams. A man might have a dream, so he would ask about him if he did not know him, and would like to hear the dream if that man was praised for his good qualities. Once a woman came to him and said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I had a dream that I was taken out of Al-Madinah and entered Paradise. I heard noise because of which Paradise wept. I looked and found so-and-so, so-and-so,' and she mentioned the names of twelve men whom the Prophet had sent with a military expedition. They were later brought on (in Paradise, in the dream) with their wounds still bleeding. It was said, `Take them to the river Baydakh or -- Baydhakh.' They were taken to that river and submerged in it and their faces turned as radiant as the full moon. They were brought a plate made of gold containing green dates. They ate as much of the green dates they wanted to and whenever they turned that plate around, they would eat from the fruit it contained, as much as they wanted, and I (the woman said) ate with them.\" Later on, that army sent an emissary to convey the news (of the battle) and he said that so-and-so and so-and-so died, mentioning the names of the twelve men who were mentioned in the dream. So, Allah's Messenger ﷺ called the woman and again asked her to mention her story, and she did. This is the narration that Abu Ya`la collected, and Al-Hafiz Ad-Diya' said, \"This Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah said,</p><p>وَلَحْمِ طَيْرٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ طَيْرَ الْجَنَّةِ كَأَمْثَالِ الْبُخْتِ، يَرْعَى فِي شَجَرِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Birds of Paradise are like Bukht camels that graze in the trees of Paradise.) Abu Bakr commented, \"O Allah's Messenger! Surely, these birds must be wonderful.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«آكِلُهَا أَنْعَمُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(Those who eat them are more wonderful.) and repeated this statement thrice. The Prophet went on,</p><p>«وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِمَّنْ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا»</p><p>(And I hope that you will be among those who eat from them.)

Allah said;</p><p>كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(Like unto preserved pearls.), indicating that they are just as white and pure fresh pearls.

This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p>جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(A reward for what they used to do.) meaning, `these delights that We granted them are rewards for the good deeds that they performed (in this life).'

    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",
    "<h2>The Reward of Those on the Right After</h2><p>Allah mentioned the final destination of those foremost in faith, the nearest to Him, He next mentioned the end of those on the right, the righteous believers. Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ مَآ أَصْحَـبُ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,</p><p>فِى سِدْرٍ مَّخْضُودٍ</p><p>((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, \"The kind without thorns.\" And from Ibn `Abbas: \"It is the one that is laden with fruits.\" This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"I was sitting with Allah's Messenger ﷺ, when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْعَلُ مَكَانَ كُلِّ شَوْكَةٍ مِنْهَا ثَمَرَةً، مِثْلَ خُصْوَةِ التَّيْسِ الْمَلْبُودِ، فِيهَا سَبْعُونَ لَوْنًا مِنَ الطَّعَامِ، لَا يُشْبِهُ لَوْنٌ آخَر»</p><p>(For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that</p><p>مَّنْضُودٍ</p><p>(Mandud) means: \"Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that</p><p>وَطَلْحٍ مَّنضُودٍ</p><p>(Talh Mandud) means: \"The banana tree.\" And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, \"Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. \" Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, \"The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.\" Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ</p><p>(And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ، اقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>وَظِلٍّ مَّمْدُودٍ »</p><p>(There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,</p><p>وَفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ - لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before, \"and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25) The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:</p><p>«فَإِذَا وَرَقُهَا كَآذَانِ الْفِيَلَةِ، وَنَبْقُهَا مِثْلُ قِلَالِ هَجَر»</p><p>(...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, \"The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger ﷺ led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ الْجَنَّةَ فَتَنَاوَلْتُ مِنْهَا عُنْقُودًا، وَلَوْ أَخَذْتُهُ لَأَكَلْتُمْ مِنْهُ مَا بَقِيَتِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)\" Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, \"A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَفِيهَا شَجَرَةٌ تُدْعَى طُوبَى»</p><p>(Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَيْسَتْ تُشْبِهُ شَيْئًا مِنْ شَجَرِ أَرْضِك»</p><p>(There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,</p><p>«أَتَيْتَ الشَّامَ؟»</p><p>(Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«تُشْبِهُ شَجَرَةً بِالشَّامِ تُدْعَى الْجَوْزَةَ، تَنْبُتُ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، وَيَنْفَرِشُ أَعْلَاهَا»</p><p>(It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,</p><p>«مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ لِلْغُرَابِ الْأَبْقَعِ وَلَا يَفْتُر»</p><p>(The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,</p><p>«لَوِ ارْتَحَلَتْ جَذَعَةٌ مِن إِبِلِ أَهْلِكَ مَا أَحَاطَتْ بِأَصْلِهَا، حَتْى تَنْكَسِرَ تَرْقُوَتُهَا هَرَمًا»</p><p>(If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,</p><p>«هَلْ ذَبَحَ أَبُوكَ تَيْسًا مِنْ غَنَمِهِ قَطُّ عَظِيمًا؟»</p><p>(Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,</p><p>«فَسَلَخَ إِهَابَهُ فَأَعْطَاهُ أُمَّكَ فَقَالَ: اتَّخِذِي لَنَا مِنْهُ دَلْوًا؟»</p><p>(And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، وَعَامَّةَ عَشِيرَتِك»</p><p>(Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)\" Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ مَقْطُوعَةٍ وَلاَ مَمْنُوعَةٍ</p><p>(Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, \"Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.\" We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:</p><p>وَفُرُشٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ</p><p>(And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,</p><p>إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِالْعَشِىِّ الصَّـفِنَـتُ الْجِيَادُ - فَقَالَ إِنِّى أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِى حَتَّى تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ</p><p>(When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, \"I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,\" till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), \"it\" (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,</p><p>وَحُورٌ عِينٌ - كَأَمْثَـلِ اللُّؤْلُؤِ الْمَكْنُونِ</p><p>(And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.) Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى الْمُؤْمِنُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ قُوَّةَ كَذَا وَكَذَا فِي النِّسَاء»</p><p>(In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, \"I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,</p><p>«يُعْطَى قُوَّةَ مِائَة»</p><p>(He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)\" At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, \"Sahih Gharib.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked, \"O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَصِلُ فِي الْيَوْمِ إِلَى مِائَةِ عَذْرَاء»</p><p>(The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, \"In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>عُرُباً</p><p>(`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.\" Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, \"The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.\" Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;</p><p>أَتْرَاباً</p><p>(Atrab), means \"They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.\" Mujahid said, \"Equal (age).\" And in a different narration, \"Similar (age).\" `Atiyah said, \"Comparative.\" Allah said,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَـهُنَّ إِنشَآءً - فَجَعَلْنَـهُنَّ أَبْكَـراً - عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,</p><p>لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,</p><p>عُرُباً أَتْرَاباً - لاًّصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلَى ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيَ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفُلُونَ، وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلَى خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلَى صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاء»</p><p>(The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full. The next group will be like the most radiant planet in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,</p><p>«عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءُ وَأَتْبَاعُهَا بِأُمَمِهَا، فَيَمُرُّ عَلَيَّ النَّبِيُّ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الْعِصَابَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ فِي الثَّلَاثَةِ، وَالنَّبِيُّ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ أَحَد»</p><p>(Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me. A Prophet would pass in front of me with a group of men, and another with three men, and another with nobody with him.) Qatadah, one of the narrators of the Hadith, then recited this Ayah,</p><p>أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ</p><p>(Is there not among you a single right-minded man)(11:78)</p><p>«حَتْى مَرَّ عَلَيَّ مُوْسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ فِي كَبْكَبَةٍ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيل»</p><p>(Until Musa, son of `Imran passed me, with a great crowd from the Children of Israel.) So he said;</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّي مَنْ هذَا؟ قَالَ: هذَا أَخُوكَ مُوسَى بْنُ عِمْرَانَ وَمَنْ تَبِعَهُ مِنْ بَنِي إسْرَائِيل»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: رَبِّ فَأَيْنَ أُمَّتِي؟ قَالَ: انْظُرْ عَنْ يَمِينِكَ فِي الظِّرَاب»</p><p>«فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«قَالَ: أَرَضِيتَ؟»</p><p>«قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«انْظُرْ إِلَى الْأُفُقِ عَنْ يَسَارِكَ، فَإِذَا وُجُوهُ الرِّجَال»</p><p>«أَرَضِيتَ؟ قُلْتُ: قَدْ رَضِيتُ رَب»</p><p>«فَإِنَّ مَعَ هؤُلَاءِ سَبْعِينَ أَلْفًا يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ بِغَيْرِ حِسَاب»</p><p>(So, I asked my Lord, \"Who is this\" He said, \"This is your brother Musa, son of `Imran, and those who followed him among the Children of Israel.\" I said, \"O Lord! Where is my Ummah\" Allah said, \"Look to your right on the hill,\" and I looked and saw faces of men. Allah said, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased O Lord!\" Allah said, \"Look to the horizon to your left,\" and I saw faces of men. He again asked, \"Are you pleased,\" and I said, \"I am pleased, O Lord!\" He said, \"And with them are seventy-thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning.\") `Ukkashah bin Mihsan from Bani Asad, one of those who participated in the battle of Badr, said, `O Allah's Messenger! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«اللْهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(O Allah, make him one of them.) Another man said, `O Allah's Messenger, invoke Allah to make me one of them.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَة»</p><p>(`Ukkashah beat you to it.) Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ فِدَاكُمْ أَبِي وَأُمِّي أَنْ تَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَاب السَّبْعِينَ فَافْعَلُوا، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظِّرَابِ، وَإِلَّا فَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الْأُفُقِ، فَإِنِّي قَدْ رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا كَثِيرًا قَدْ تَأَشَّبُوا حَوْلَه»</p><p>(Therefore, may I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Try to be among the seventy (thousands), or among the crowds on the right, or the crowds that covered the side of the horizon, because I saw large crowds gathering on that side.) He continued:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a fourth of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar. ' He said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) and we said, `Allahu Akbar.' The Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,) and we said `Allahu Akbar.' Then Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>ثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّوَّلِينَ وَثُلَّةٌ مِّنَ الاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) We said to each other, `Who are those seventy thousand' We then said, `They are those who were born in Islam and did not associate (anything or anyone in the worship of Allah).' When what we said reached the Prophet , he said,</p><p>«بَلْ هُمُ الَّذِينَ لَا يَكْتَوُونَ، وَلَا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلَا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ، وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُون»</p><p>(They are the people who do not get treated by cauterization themselves, do not ask for Ruqyah (get oneself treated by the recitation of some verses of the Qur`an) and do not draw an evil omen from (birds), but put their trust (only) in their Lord.)\" This Hadith has many chains of narration collected in the Sahihs and other collections of Hadith.</p>",

Nay, but we are deprived!\") Allah says, `if We crumble the plants into dry pieces, you would be wondering regarding what happened, sometimes saying: we are indeed Mughramun, i.e., ruined.' Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Mughramun means, being the subject of revenge. Qatadah commented, \"You would say, `We were punished,' sometimes, and, `We were deprived,' some other times.\" `Ikrimah said that `You will be Tafakkahun' means `You will blame each other (and yourselves),' or, feel sorrow, according to Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi. They will be feeling grief for what they spent or for the sins that they have committed in the past (which cost the destruction of their plants).

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and An-Nadr bin `Arabi said, \"The meaning of Al-Muqwin is travelers.\" This is also what Ibn Jarir chose, and he said, \"From it comes the saying Aqwat Ad-Dar (the house has become empty), when its people traveled.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that here Al-Muqwi means the hungry.

It is out of Allah's kindness that He has made the quality of kindling fire in some elements, such as stones, that people can use and take in the baggage for their journeys. When a traveler needs fire at his campsite for cooking and heating, he takes out these substances and uses them to kindle fire. He feels comfort next to the fire and he can use it for various needs that he has. Allah mentions this favor specifically in the case of travelers, even though everyone benefits from the fire. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) meaning, the One by Whose ability these things opposites were created.

He also created the fire that burns, and made a benefit in it for the servants, suitable for their livelihood in this life and as a warning and a punishment for them in the Hereafter.</p>",

Nay, but we are deprived!\") Allah says, `if We crumble the plants into dry pieces, you would be wondering regarding what happened, sometimes saying: we are indeed Mughramun, i.e., ruined.' Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Mughramun means, being the subject of revenge. Qatadah commented, \"You would say, `We were punished,' sometimes, and, `We were deprived,' some other times.\" `Ikrimah said that `You will be Tafakkahun' means `You will blame each other (and yourselves),' or, feel sorrow, according to Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi.

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and An-Nadr bin `Arabi said, \"The meaning of Al-Muqwin is travelers.\" This is also what Ibn Jarir chose, and he said, \"From it comes the saying Aqwat Ad-Dar (the house has become empty), when its people traveled.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that here Al-Muqwi means the hungry.

It is out of Allah's kindness that He has made the quality of kindling fire in some elements, such as stones, that people can use and take in the baggage for their journeys. When a traveler needs fire at his campsite for cooking and heating, he takes out these substances and uses them to kindle fire. He feels comfort next to the fire and he can use it for various needs that he has. Allah mentions this favor specifically in the case of travelers, even though everyone benefits from the fire.

He also created the fire that burns, and made a benefit in it for the servants, suitable for their livelihood in this life and as a warning and a punishment for them in the Hereafter.</p>",

    "<h2>Allah's Oneness demonstrated by causing the Plants to grow, sending down the Rain</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ</p><p>(Do you not see what you sow.) in reference to tilling the earth and planting seeds inside it,</p><p>أَءَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ</p><p>(Is it you that make it grow,) `do you cause these seeds to grow inside the earth,'</p><p>أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَرِعُونَ</p><p>(or are We the Grower) Allah says, `rather it is We Who cause the seeds to remain firmly and grow inside the earth.'

Nay, but we are deprived!\") Allah says, `if We crumble the plants into dry pieces, you would be wondering regarding what happened, sometimes saying: we are indeed Mughramun, i.e., ruined.' Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Mughramun means, being the subject of revenge. Qatadah commented, \"You would say, `We were punished,' sometimes, and, `We were deprived,' some other times.\" `Ikrimah said that `You will be Tafakkahun' means `You will blame each other (and yourselves),' or, feel sorrow, according to Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi. They will be feeling grief for what they spent or for the sins that they have committed in the past (which cost the destruction of their plants).

Allah's statement,</p><p>نَحْنُ جَعَلْنَـهَا تَذْكِرَةً</p><p>(We have made it a Reminder,) of the Hellfire, according to Mujahid and Qatadah.

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and An-Nadr bin `Arabi said, \"The meaning of Al-Muqwin is travelers.\" This is also what Ibn Jarir chose, and he said, \"From it comes the saying Aqwat Ad-Dar (the house has become empty), when its people traveled.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that here Al-Muqwi means the hungry.

It is out of Allah's kindness that He has made the quality of kindling fire in some elements, such as stones, that people can use and take in the baggage for their journeys. When a traveler needs fire at his campsite for cooking and heating, he takes out these substances and uses them to kindle fire. He feels comfort next to the fire and he can use it for various needs that he has. Allah mentions this favor specifically in the case of travelers, even though everyone benefits from the fire.

This fire alone is sufficiently hot.\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّهَا قَدْ فُضِّلَتْ عَلَيْهَا بِتِسْعَةٍ وَسِتِّينَ جُزْءًا»</p><p>((The fire of Hell) was made sixty-nine times hotter.) Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith from Malik and Muslim from Abu Az-Zinad. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَتَـعاً لِّلْمُقْوِينَ</p><p>(and an article of use for the Muqwin.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and An-Nadr bin `Arabi said, \"The meaning of Al-Muqwin is travelers.\" This is also what Ibn Jarir chose, and he said, \"From it comes the saying Aqwat Ad-Dar (the house has become empty), when its people traveled.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that here Al-Muqwi means the hungry. Layth bin Abi Sulaym reported that Mujahid said about the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَتَـعاً لِّلْمُقْوِينَ</p><p>(and an article of use for the Muqwin.) \"For those who are present at their homes and travelers, for every kind of food that requires cooking by fire.\" Ibn Abi Najih also reported that Mujahid said, \"`For the Muqwin, means, all people who enjoy (eating food cooked by fire).\" Similar was mentioned from `Ikrimah, and this explanation is more general than the previous, since those who are in their own locale and traveling, whether rich or poor, all need fire for cooking, heating and lighting purposes. It is out of Allah's kindness that He has made the quality of kindling fire in some elements, such as stones, that people can use and take in the baggage for their journeys. When a traveler needs fire at his campsite for cooking and heating, he takes out these substances and uses them to kindle fire. He feels comfort next to the fire and he can use it for various needs that he has. Allah mentions this favor specifically in the case of travelers, even though everyone benefits from the fire. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) meaning, the One by Whose ability these things opposites were created. He created the fresh tasty water, and had He willed, He would have created it salty like seawater. He also created the fire that burns, and made a benefit in it for the servants, suitable for their livelihood in this life and as a warning and a punishment for them in the Hereafter.</p>",
    "<h2>Allah's Oneness demonstrated by causing the Plants to grow, sending down the Rain</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ</p><p>(Do you not see what you sow.) in reference to tilling the earth and planting seeds inside it,</p><p>أَءَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ</p><p>(Is it you that make it grow,) `do you cause these seeds to grow inside the earth,'</p><p>أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَرِعُونَ</p><p>(or are We the Grower) Allah says, `rather it is We Who cause the seeds to remain firmly and grow inside the earth.'

Nay, but we are deprived!\") Allah says, `if We crumble the plants into dry pieces, you would be wondering regarding what happened, sometimes saying: we are indeed Mughramun, i.e., ruined.' Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Mughramun means, being the subject of revenge. Qatadah commented, \"You would say, `We were punished,' sometimes, and, `We were deprived,' some other times.\" `Ikrimah said that `You will be Tafakkahun' means `You will blame each other (and yourselves),' or, feel sorrow, according to Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi. They will be feeling grief for what they spent or for the sins that they have committed in the past (which cost the destruction of their plants). Al-Kisa'i said, \"Tafakkaha is both the synonym and the antonym.\" The Arabs say Tafakkahtu when they mean that they have enjoyed something or felt grief.

Qatadah said, \"We were told that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, i</p><p>«يَا قَوْمِ نَارُكُمْ هذِهِ الَّتِي تُوقِدُونَ، جُزْءٌ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّم»</p><p>(O people, this fire of yours that you kindle, is but one part out of seventy parts of the fire of Hell.) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger! This fire alone is sufficiently hot.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّهَا قَدْ ضُرِبَتْ (بِالْمَاءِ) ضَرْبَتَيْنِ أَوْ مَرَّتَيْنِ حَتْى يَسْتَنْفِعَ بِهَا بَنُو آدَمَ وَيَدْنُوا مِنْهَا»</p><p>(It was submerged in the water twice so that the Children of `Adam would be able to benefit from it and draw closer to it.) This narration from Qatadah which is Mursal, was recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet ;</p><p>«إِنَّ نَارَكُمْ هذِهِ جُزْءٌ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، وَضُرِبَتْ بِالْبَحْرِ مَرَّتَيْنِ، وَلَوْلَا ذلِكَ مَا جَعَلَ اللهُ فِيهَا مَنْفَعَةً لِأَحَد»</p><p>(Verily, this fire of yours is one part out of seventy parts of the fire of Hell. It was struck twice against the sea, otherwise, Allah would not have made benefit in it for anyone.) Imam Malik also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«نَارُ بَنِي آدَمَ الَّتِي يُوقِدُونَ، جُزْءٌ مِنْ سَبْعِينَ جُزْءًا مِنْ نَارِ جَهَنَّم»</p><p>(The fire that the Children of `Adam kindle is one part out of seventy parts of the fire of Hell.) They said, \"O Allah's Messenger! This fire alone is sufficiently hot.\" He said,</p><p>«إِنَّهَا قَدْ فُضِّلَتْ عَلَيْهَا بِتِسْعَةٍ وَسِتِّينَ جُزْءًا»</p><p>((The fire of Hell) was made sixty-nine times hotter.) Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith from Malik and Muslim from Abu Az-Zinad. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَتَـعاً لِّلْمُقْوِينَ</p><p>(and an article of use for the Muqwin.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and An-Nadr bin `Arabi said, \"The meaning of Al-Muqwin is travelers.\" This is also what Ibn Jarir chose, and he said, \"From it comes the saying Aqwat Ad-Dar (the house has become empty), when its people traveled.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that here Al-Muqwi means the hungry. Layth bin Abi Sulaym reported that Mujahid said about the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَتَـعاً لِّلْمُقْوِينَ</p><p>(and an article of use for the Muqwin.) \"For those who are present at their homes and travelers, for every kind of food that requires cooking by fire.\" Ibn Abi Najih also reported that Mujahid said, \"`For the Muqwin, means, all people who enjoy (eating food cooked by fire).\" Similar was mentioned from `Ikrimah, and this explanation is more general than the previous, since those who are in their own locale and traveling, whether rich or poor, all need fire for cooking, heating and lighting purposes. It is out of Allah's kindness that He has made the quality of kindling fire in some elements, such as stones, that people can use and take in the baggage for their journeys. When a traveler needs fire at his campsite for cooking and heating, he takes out these substances and uses them to kindle fire. He feels comfort next to the fire and he can use it for various needs that he has. Allah mentions this favor specifically in the case of travelers, even though everyone benefits from the fire. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) meaning, the One by Whose ability these things opposites were created. He created the fresh tasty water, and had He willed, He would have created it salty like seawater. He also created the fire that burns, and made a benefit in it for the servants, suitable for their livelihood in this life and as a warning and a punishment for them in the Hereafter.</p>",
    "<h2>Allah's Oneness demonstrated by causing the Plants to grow, sending down the Rain</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ</p><p>(Do you not see what you sow.) in reference to tilling the earth and planting seeds inside it,</p><p>أَءَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ</p><p>(Is it you that make it grow,) `do you cause these seeds to grow inside the earth,'</p><p>أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَرِعُونَ</p><p>(or are We the Grower) Allah says, `rather it is We Who cause the seeds to remain firmly and grow inside the earth.' Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَقُولَنَّ: زَرَعْتُ وَلكِنْ قُلْ: حَرَثْت»</p><p>(Do not say, \"Zara`tu (I made it grew),\" but say, \"Harathtu (I sowed tilled).\") Abu Hurayrah added, \"Have you not heard Allah's statement,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ - أَءَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَرِعُونَ</p><p>(Do you not see what you sow. Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower)\" Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>لَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَاهُ حُطَـماً</p><p>(Were it Our will, We could crumble it to dry pieces,) meaning, `We caused the seeds to grow with Our compassion and mercy and left them intact inside the earth as mercy for you. If We will, We would turn them dry before they ripen and get ready to be harvested,'</p><p>فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ</p><p>(and you would be Tafakkahun.) Allah explained this statement by saying,</p><p>إِنَّا لَمُغْرَمُونَ - بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ</p><p>((Saying:) \"We are indeed Mughramun! Nay, but we are deprived!\") Allah says, `if We crumble the plants into dry pieces, you would be wondering regarding what happened, sometimes saying: we are indeed Mughramun, i.e., ruined.' Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Mughramun means, being the subject of revenge. Qatadah commented, \"You would say, `We were punished,' sometimes, and, `We were deprived,' some other times.\" `Ikrimah said that `You will be Tafakkahun' means `You will blame each other (and yourselves),' or, feel sorrow, according to Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi. They will be feeling grief for what they spent or for the sins that they have committed in the past (which cost the destruction of their plants). Al-Kisa'i said, \"Tafakkaha is both the synonym and the antonym.\" The Arabs say Tafakkahtu when they mean that they have enjoyed something or felt grief. Allah the Exalted said next,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ الْمَآءَ الَّذِى تَشْرَبُونَ أَءَنتُمْ أَنزَلْتُمُوهُ مِنَ الْمُزْنِ</p><p>(Do you not see the water that you drink. Is it you who cause it to come down from Al-Muzn,) meaning clouds, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others. Allah said,</p><p>أَمْ نَحْنُ الْمُنزِلُونَ</p><p>(or are We the Causer of it to come down) Allah is stating that indeed He is the One Who causes the rain to fall,</p><p>لَوْ نَشَآءُ جَعَلْنَـهُ أُجَاجاً</p><p>(If We willed, We verily could make it salty;) meaning salty, sour, undrinkable and unfit for growing plants,</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ تَشْكُرُونَ</p><p>(why then do you not give thanks) `why do you not appreciate the favor Allah does for you by sending down the rain fresh, ready to consume,'</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَآءً لَّكُم مَّنْهُ شَرَابٌ وَمِنْهُ شَجَرٌ فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ - يُنبِتُ لَكُمْ بِهِ الزَّرْعَ وَالزَّيْتُونَ وَالنَّخِيلَ وَالأَعْنَـبَ وَمِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(From it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture. With it He causes to grow for you the crops, the olives, the date palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit. Verily, in this is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.)(16:10-11) Allah said,</p><p>أَفَرَءَيْتُمُ النَّارَ الَّتِى تُورُونَ</p><p>(Do you not see the fire which you kindle. ) `and the fire you start with the use of trees,'</p><p>أَءَنتُمْ أَنشَأْتُمْ شَجَرَتَهَآ أَمْ نَحْنُ الْمُنشِئُونَ</p><p>(Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower) meaning, `rather We have made kindling fire possible.' The Arabs had two kinds of trees called Al-Markh and Al-`Afar (that they used to ignite a fire). When they would rub a green branch from each of these two trees against each other, sparkles of fire would emit from them. Allah's statement,</p><p>نَحْنُ جَعَلْنَـهَا تَذْكِرَةً</p><p>(We have made it a Reminder,) of the Hellfire, according to Mujahid and Qatadah.

    "<h2>Allah swears to the Greatness of the Qur'an</h2><p>The usage of La (in Fala) is not an extra character without meaning, as some of the scholars of Tafsir say. Rather it is used at the beginning of an oath when the oath is a negation. This is like when `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said, \"La by Allah! Allah's Messenger ﷺ did not touch any woman's hand at all. So in this way, the meaning is, \"No! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars. The matter is not as you people claim - about the Qur'an - that it is a result of magic or sorcery, rather it is an Honorable Qur'an.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that the meaning of:</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ</p><p>(Fala! I swear) is, `The matter is not as you people have claimed.' Then He renews the oath again by saying, `I swear.\"'</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِمَوَقِعِ النُّجُومِ</p><p>(Fala! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars.) Mujahid said, \"The setting positions of the stars in the sky,\" and he said that it refers to the rising and setting positions. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and preferred by Ibn Jarir. Qatadah also said that it means their positions. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.) meaning, `this is a great vow that I -- Allah -- am making; if you knew the greatness of this vow, you will know the greatness of the subject of the vow,'</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.) means, verily, this Qur'an that was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ is a Glorious Book,</p><p>فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ</p><p>(In a Book Maknun.) meaning glorious; in a glorious, well-guarded, revered Book. Ibn Jarir narrated that Isma`il bin Musa said that Sharik reported from Hakim, that is Ibn Jubayr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr, from Ibn `Abbas that about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) he said, \"The Book that is in heaven.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that `the pure ones' means: \"The angels.\" Similar was said by Anas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' Jabir bin Zayd, Abu Nahik, As-Suddi, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an.

Neither would it suit them nor they can (produce it). Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.)(26:210-212)\" This saying is a good saying, and does not contradict those before it. Allah said,</p><p>تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry. Rather it is the truth, no doubt about it; there is none beyond it of useful truth. Allah's statement,</p><p>أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ</p><p>(Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi. Mujahid said,</p><p>مُّدْهِنُونَ</p><p>(Mudhinun) means \"You want to fill yourselves with and rely upon.\"</p><p>وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(And you make your provision your denial!) some of them said that provision here has the meaning of gratitude, meaning: you deny without any gratitude. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he recited it as: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And your show of your gratitude by denying!) Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the congregation and said,</p><p>«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟»</p><p>(Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)) Those present replied, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><p>«قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ، فَذلِكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذلِكَ كَافِرٌ بِي وَمُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»</p><p>(Allah has said, \"During this morning some of my servants remained as true believers in Me and some became disbelievers. Whoever said that the rain was due to the blessings and the mercy of Allah, had belief in Me, and he disbelieves in the stars; and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star, had no belief in Me, but believes in that star.\")\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, all using a chain of narration in which Imam Malik was included. Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><p>أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>",

Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the congregation and said,</p><p>«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟»</p><p>(Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)) Those present replied, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><p>«قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ، فَذلِكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذلِكَ كَافِرٌ بِي وَمُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَب»</p><p>(Allah has said, \"During this morning some of my servants remained as true believers in Me and some became disbelievers. Whoever said that the rain was due to the blessings and the mercy of Allah, had belief in Me, and he disbelieves in the stars; and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star, had no belief in Me, but believes in that star.\")\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, all using a chain of narration in which Imam Malik was included. Qatadah said, \"Al-Hasan used to say, `How evil is that all that some people have earned for themselves from the Book of Allah, is denying it!\"' Al-Hasan's statement means that such people gained no benefit from the Book of Allah because they denied it, as Allah said:</p><p>أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ - وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(Is it such a talk that you Mudhinun And you make your provision that you deny!)</p>",
    "<h2>Allah swears to the Greatness of the Qur'an</h2><p>The usage of La (in Fala) is not an extra character without meaning, as some of the scholars of Tafsir say. Rather it is used at the beginning of an oath when the oath is a negation. This is like when `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said, \"La by Allah! Allah's Messenger ﷺ did not touch any woman's hand at all. So in this way, the meaning is, \"No! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars. The matter is not as you people claim - about the Qur'an - that it is a result of magic or sorcery, rather it is an Honorable Qur'an.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that the meaning of:</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ</p><p>(Fala!

I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars.) Mujahid said, \"The setting positions of the stars in the sky,\" and he said that it refers to the rising and setting positions. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and preferred by Ibn Jarir. Qatadah also said that it means their positions. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.) meaning, `this is a great vow that I -- Allah -- am making; if you knew the greatness of this vow, you will know the greatness of the subject of the vow,'</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.) means, verily, this Qur'an that was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ is a Glorious Book,</p><p>فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ</p><p>(In a Book Maknun.) meaning glorious; in a glorious, well-guarded, revered Book. Ibn Jarir narrated that Isma`il bin Musa said that Sharik reported from Hakim, that is Ibn Jubayr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr, from Ibn `Abbas that about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) he said, \"The Book that is in heaven.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that `the pure ones' means: \"The angels.\" Similar was said by Anas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' Jabir bin Zayd, Abu Nahik, As-Suddi, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an.

Neither would it suit them nor they can (produce it). Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.)(26:210-212)\" This saying is a good saying, and does not contradict those before it. Allah said,</p><p>تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry.

    "<h2>Allah swears to the Greatness of the Qur'an</h2><p>The usage of La (in Fala) is not an extra character without meaning, as some of the scholars of Tafsir say. Rather it is used at the beginning of an oath when the oath is a negation. This is like when `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said, \"La by Allah! Allah's Messenger ﷺ did not touch any woman's hand at all. So in this way, the meaning is, \"No! I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars. The matter is not as you people claim - about the Qur'an - that it is a result of magic or sorcery, rather it is an Honorable Qur'an.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that the meaning of:</p><p>فَلاَ أُقْسِمُ</p><p>(Fala!

I swear by the Mawaqi` of the stars.) Mujahid said, \"The setting positions of the stars in the sky,\" and he said that it refers to the rising and setting positions. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and preferred by Ibn Jarir. Qatadah also said that it means their positions. Allah said,</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَقَسَمٌ لَّوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.) meaning, `this is a great vow that I -- Allah -- am making; if you knew the greatness of this vow, you will know the greatness of the subject of the vow,'</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.) means, verily, this Qur'an that was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ is a Glorious Book,</p><p>فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ</p><p>(In a Book Maknun.) meaning glorious; in a glorious, well-guarded, revered Book. Ibn Jarir narrated that Isma`il bin Musa said that Sharik reported from Hakim, that is Ibn Jubayr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr, from Ibn `Abbas that about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) he said, \"The Book that is in heaven.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that `the pure ones' means: \"The angels.\" Similar was said by Anas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' Jabir bin Zayd, Abu Nahik, As-Suddi, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abdul-A`la said that Ibn Thawr said that Ma`mar said from Qatadah about:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) that he said, \"None can touch it, with Allah, except the pure ones. However, in this life, the impure Zoroastrian and the filthy hypocrite touch it.\" And he said, \"In the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud it is: (مَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ) (It is not touched, except by the pure ones.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said:</p><p>لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ</p><p>(Which none touches but the pure ones.) \"It does not refer to you, because you are sinners!\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The Quraysh disbelievers claimed that the devils brought down the Qur'an.

Neither would it suit them nor they can (produce it). Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.)(26:210-212)\" This saying is a good saying, and does not contradict those before it. Allah said,</p><p>تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(A revelation from the Lord of all that exists. ) meaning this Qur'an is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists, not as they say that it is magic, sorcery or poetry.

Allah's statement,</p><p>أَفَبِهَـذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَنتُمْ مُّدْهِنُونَ</p><p>(Is it such a talk that you are Mudhinun) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that Mudhinun means, \"You do not believe in and deny.\" Similar to this was said by Ad-Dahhak, Abu Hazrah and As-Suddi.

Ibn Jarir narrated from Muhammad bin Bashshar, who narrated from Muhammad bin Ja`far, who narrated from Shu`bah, from Abu Bishr, from Sa`id bin Jubayr who said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It has never rained upon a people except that some of them became disbelievers by saying, `Such and such position of a star sent rain!\"' And Ibn `Abbas recited: (وَتَجْعَلُونَ شُكْرَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُكَذِّبُونَ) (And you show of your gratitude by denying.) This chain of narration is Sahih to Ibn `Abbas. In his Muwatta', Malik reported from Salih bin Kaysan, from `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud, from Zayd bin Khalid Al-Juhani who said, \"The Prophet led us in the Subh (dawn) prayer at Al-Hudaybiyah after a rainy night.

    "<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2><p>These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death. Either they are among the near believers or those below their rank on the right, or those who denied the truth, were led astray from the guidance and were ignorant about Allah. Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ</p><p>(Then if he), in reference to the dying person,</p><p>مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ</p><p>(be of the Muqarrabun) who fulfilled the obligations and the recommended acts of worship and avoided the forbidden and disliked matters and even some of the allowed,</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(then for him Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.) Theirs will be Rawh and Rayhan; and the glad tidings of these traits will be conveyed to them by the angels at the time of death. We mentioned before the Prophet's Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' in which the angels of mercy say (to a dying, believing person),</p><p>«أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَه، اخْرُجِي إِلَى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»</p><p>(O good soul in the good body that you inhabited, come to Rawh, Rayhan and a Lord Who is not angry.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Rawh means rest, and Rayhan means place of rest.\" Mujahid said similarly that Rawh means rest. Abu Hazrah said that Rawh means: \"Rest from the world.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that it means to rejoice. And from Mujahid:</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ</p><p>(Rawh and Rayhan) means: \"Paradise and delights.\" Qatadah said that Rawh means mercy. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning. The near believers who die will earn all of these; mercy, rest, provision, joy, happiness and good delights,</p><p>وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(and a Garden of Delights.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»</p><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»</p><p>(He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.) The people around him started weeping, and he asked them why they wept. They said, `All of us hate death.' He said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ ذَاكَ، وَلكِنَّهُ إِذَا احْتُضِرَ</p><p>فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>فَإِذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، وَاللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلِقَائِهِ أَحَبُّ</p><p>وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ</p><p>فَإذَا بُشِّرَ بِذلِكَ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ،وَاللهُ تَعَالَى لِلِقَائِهِ أَكْرَه»</p><p>(It does not mean that. When one dies: (Then, if he be of the near believers, then for him are Rawh, Rayhan, and a Garden of Delights.)( and when this good news is conveyed to him, he likes to meet Allah the Exalted and Most Honored and Allah the Exalted and Most Honored likes, even more, to meet him, (But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim. And entry in Hellfire.)( and when this news is conveyed to him, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates, even more, to meet him.)\" This is the narration that Imam Ahmad collected; and in the Sahih, there is a Hadith with this meaning collected from `A'ishah. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(And if he be of those on the right,) means, if he, the dying person, is among those on the right,</p><p>فَسَلَـمٌ لَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَـبِ الْيَمِينِ</p><p>(Then Salam (peace) to you from those on the right) meaning, the angels will deliver the good news to them by saying, \"Peace be upon you,\" i.e., be calm, you will be led to safety, you are among those on the right, as `Ikrimah said, \"The angels will greet him with the Salam and convey to him the news that he is among those on the right. \" This is a good explanation, and it conforms with Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَـمُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ - نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِى أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ - نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ</p><p>(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is Allah.\" and then they stand firm, on them the angles will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): \"Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. An entertainment from the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") (41:30-32). Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ الضَّآلِّينَ - فَنُزُلٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ - وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ</p><p>(But if he be of the denying, the erring, then for him is an entertainment with Hamim (boiling water) and entry in Hellfire.) meaning, if the dying person is one of those who denied the truth, who were led astray from guidance,</p><p>فَنُزُلٌ</p><p>(then for him is an entertainment,) meaning, as a guest</p><p>مِنْ حَمِيمٍ</p><p>(with Hamim) that dissolves his intestines and skin,</p><p>وَتَصْلِيَةُ جَحِيمٍ</p><p>(And entry in Hellfire.) he will reside in Hellfire, which will engulf him from every direction. Allah the Exalted said, next,</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ حَقُّ الْيَقِينِ</p><p>(Verily, this! This is an absolute truth with certainty.) meaning, this news is the truth; there is no doubt about it, nor escape from it for anyone,</p><p>فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(So, glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ قَالَ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، غُرِسَتْ لَهُ نَخْلَةٌ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(He who says, \"Glory be to Allah the Magnificent and with His praise!\" then a date tree will be planted for him in Paradise.) This Hadith was collected by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Al-Bukhari recorded in his book (Sahih) that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمنِ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيم»</p><p>((There are) two statements that are light on the tongue, but heavy on the Balance, and most beloved to Ar-Rahman: \"Glory be to Allah and with His praise, glory be to Allah the Magnificent.\") The Group, with the exception of Abu Dawud, collected this. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Waqi`ah, all praise and thanks are due to Allah and all the favors come from Him.</p>",

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning.

Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»</p><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»</p><p>(He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.)

    "<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2><p>These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death.

    "<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2><p>These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death. Either they are among the near believers or those below their rank on the right, or those who denied the truth, were led astray from the guidance and were ignorant about Allah. Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ</p><p>(Then if he), in reference to the dying person,</p><p>مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ</p><p>(be of the Muqarrabun) who fulfilled the obligations and the recommended acts of worship and avoided the forbidden and disliked matters and even some of the allowed,</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(then for him Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.) Theirs will be Rawh and Rayhan; and the glad tidings of these traits will be conveyed to them by the angels at the time of death. We mentioned before the Prophet's Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' in which the angels of mercy say (to a dying, believing person),</p><p>«أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَه، اخْرُجِي إِلَى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»</p><p>(O good soul in the good body that you inhabited, come to Rawh, Rayhan and a Lord Who is not angry.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Rawh means rest, and Rayhan means place of rest.\" Mujahid said similarly that Rawh means rest. Abu Hazrah said that Rawh means: \"Rest from the world.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that it means to rejoice. And from Mujahid:</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ</p><p>(Rawh and Rayhan) means: \"Paradise and delights.\" Qatadah said that Rawh means mercy. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning. The near believers who die will earn all of these; mercy, rest, provision, joy, happiness and good delights,</p><p>وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(and a Garden of Delights.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»</p><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»</p><p>(He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.)

    "<h2>The Condition of People at the Time of Their Death</h2><p>These are the three types of conditions that people face upon their death. Either they are among the near believers or those below their rank on the right, or those who denied the truth, were led astray from the guidance and were ignorant about Allah. Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّآ إِن كَانَ</p><p>(Then if he), in reference to the dying person,</p><p>مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ</p><p>(be of the Muqarrabun) who fulfilled the obligations and the recommended acts of worship and avoided the forbidden and disliked matters and even some of the allowed,</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(then for him Rawh, Rayhan and a Garden of Delights.) Theirs will be Rawh and Rayhan; and the glad tidings of these traits will be conveyed to them by the angels at the time of death. We mentioned before the Prophet's Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' in which the angels of mercy say (to a dying, believing person),</p><p>«أَيَّتُهَا الرُّوحُ الطَّيِّبَةُ فِي الْجَسَدِ الطَّيِّبِ كُنْتِ تَعْمُرِينَه، اخْرُجِي إِلَى رَوْحٍ وَرَيْحَانٍ وَرَبَ غَيْرِ غَضْبَان»</p><p>(O good soul in the good body that you inhabited, come to Rawh, Rayhan and a Lord Who is not angry.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Rawh means rest, and Rayhan means place of rest.\" Mujahid said similarly that Rawh means rest. Abu Hazrah said that Rawh means: \"Rest from the world.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that it means to rejoice. And from Mujahid:</p><p>فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ</p><p>(Rawh and Rayhan) means: \"Paradise and delights.\" Qatadah said that Rawh means mercy. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Rayhan means provisions. All of these explanations are correct and similar in meaning. The near believers who die will earn all of these; mercy, rest, provision, joy, happiness and good delights,</p><p>وَجَنَّـتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p>(and a Garden of Delights.) Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"None of the near believers will depart (this life) until after he is brought a branch of the Rayhan of Paradise and his soul is captured in it.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"Every person who dies will know upon his death if he is among the people of Paradise or the people of the Fire.\" In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طُيُورٍ خُضْرٍ، تَسْرَحُ فِي رِيَاضِ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى قَنَادِيلَ مُعَلَّقَةٍ بِالْعَرْش»</p><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds flying wherever they wish in the Gardens of Paradise, and then rest to their nests in chandeliers hung from the Throne of the Almighty....) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said, \"The first day I saw `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Layla, I saw an old man whose hair had become white on his head and beard. He was riding his donkey and following a funeral. I heard him say, `So-and-so narrated to me that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ أَحَبَّ لِقَاءَ اللهِ أَحَبَّ اللهُ لِقَاءَهُ، وَمَنْ كَرِهَ لِقَاءَ اللهِ كَرِهَ اللهُ لِقَاءَه»</p><p>(He who likes to meet Allah, Allah likes to meet him, and he who hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.)

    "<h2>Allah's Knowledge, Power and Kingdom are Limitless</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that He created the heavens and earth, and all that is between them, in six Days and then rose over the Throne after He created them. We discussed this before in the explanation of Surat Al-A`raf, so it is not necessary to repeat the meaning here. Allah's statement,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلْجُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He knows what goes into the earth), indicates His knowledge in the amount of seeds and drops of water that enter inside the earth's surface,</p><p>وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا</p><p>(and what comes forth from it) of plants, vegetation and fruits. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And with Him are the keys of all that is hidden, none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.)(6:59) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ</p><p>(and what descends from the heaven), pertains to rain, snow, hail and whatever Allah decides descends from heaven of decisions and commandments brought down by the honorable angels. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا</p><p>(and what ascends thereto.), refers to angels and deeds. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Prophet said,</p><p>«يُرْفَعُ إِلَيْهِ عَمَلُ اللَّيْلِ قَبْلَ النَّهَارِ، وَعَمَلُ النَّهَارِ قَبْلَ اللَّيْل»</p><p>(To Him ascend the deeds of the night before the day falls and the deeds of the day before the night falls.) Allah said,</p><p>وَهُوَ مَعَكُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(And He is with you wheresoever you may be. And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.) meaning, He is watching over you and witnessing your deeds wherever you may be, on land or at sea, during the night or the day, at home or in open areas or deserts. All of that is the same before His knowledge and all of it is under His sight and hearing. He hears your speech and sees where you are. He knows your secrets and your public statements,</p><p>أَلا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُواْ مِنْهُ أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All-Knower of the (secrets) of the breasts. )(11:5) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ</p><p>(It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.)(13:10) Surely, there is no deity worthy of worship, except Allah. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ answered Jibril, when he asked him about Ihsan:</p><p>«أَنْ تَعْبُدَ اللهَ كَأَنَّكَ تَرَاهُ، فَإِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ تَرَاهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَرَاك»</p><p>(To worship Allah as if you see Him, and even though you cannot see Him, He surely sees you.)

And to Allh return all the matters.) asserts that Allah is the King and Owner of this life and the Hereafter. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلاٌّخِرَةَ وَالاٍّولَى</p><p>(And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).)(92:13) Surely, Allah is praised for this attribute, just as He said in other Ayat,</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٍّولَى وَالاٌّخِرَةِ</p><p>(And He is Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, all praise is His in the first and in the last.)(28:70), and,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْخَبِيرُ</p><p>(All the praise is Allah's, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. His is all the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.)(34:1) Allah owns everything that is in the heavens and earth, and all their inhabitants are servants to Him and humble before Him, just as He said,</p><p>إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً</p><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:93-95) This is why Allah said here,</p><p>وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الأُمُورُ</p><p>(And to Allah return all the matters.) meaning that all matters will be referred to Him on the Day of Resurrection and He will judge His creation as He wills.

Allah's statement,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلْجُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He knows what goes into the earth), indicates His knowledge in the amount of seeds and drops of water that enter inside the earth's surface,</p><p>وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا</p><p>(and what comes forth from it) of plants, vegetation and fruits.

    "<h2>Ordering Faith and encouraging spending</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Blessed orders having perfect faith in Him and in His Messenger, and that one should persist on this path adhereing firmly to it. Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as he was reciting and saying,</p><p>أَلْهَـكُمُ التَّكَّاثُرُ</p><p>يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَهَلْ لَكَ مِن مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَاأَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ؟»</p><p>((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, \"My wealth, my wealth.\" But is there anything belonging to you, except that which you consumed, which you used, or which you wore and then it became worn or you gave as charity and sent it forward) Muslim also collected with the addition:</p><p>«وَمَا سِوَى ذلِكَ، فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(Other than that, you will go away from it and leave it behind for other people.) Allah's statement,</p><p>فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُواْ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward.) encourages having faith and spending in acts of obedience. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord;) meaning, \"what prevents you from believing, while the Messenger is among you calling you to faith and bringing forward clear proofs and evidences that affirm the truth of what he brought you\" And we have reported the Hadith through different routes in the beginning of the explanation on the chapter on Faith in Sahih Al-Bukhari, wherein one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعْجَبُ إِلَيْكُمْ إِيمَانًا؟»</p><p>(Who do you consider among the believers as having the most amazing faith) They said, \"The angels.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»</p><p>(And what prevents them from believing when they are with their Lord) They said, \"Then the Prophets.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْوَحْيُ يَنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِمْ؟»</p><p>(What prevents them from believing when the revelation comes down to them) They said, \"Then us.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ؟ وَلكِنْ أَعْجَبُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِيمَانًا، قَوْمٌ يَجِيئُونَ بَعْدَكُمْ، يَجِدُونَ صُحُفًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(What prevents you from believing, when I am amongst you Actually, the believers who have the most amazing faith, are some people who will come after you; they will find pages that they will believe in.) We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ</p><p>(and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\")(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,</p><p>لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p>(that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تُنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.)(34:39), and,</p><p>مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</p><p>(whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain.)(16:96) Therefore, those who trust in and depend on Allah will spend, and they will not fear poverty or destitution coming to them from the Owner of the Throne. They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend.</p><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ الْفَتْحِ وَقَـتَلَ</p><p>(Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أَنفَقُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَقَـتَلُواْ وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, \"Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.' When the news of this statement reached the Prophet he said,</p><p>«دَعُوا لِي أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ أَوْ مِثْلَ الْجِبَالِ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغْتُمْ أَعْمَالَهُم»</p><p>(Do not bother my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If you spend an amount of gold equal to (Mount) Uhud, (or equal to the mountains), you will not reach the level of their actions.)\" It is a known fact that Khalid bin Al-Walid, whom the Prophet addressed this statement to, embraced Islam during the period between the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the conquering of Makkah. The dispute between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman occurred because of the battle of Bani Jadhimah. The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to them after the conquest of Makkah, and they said, \"Saba'na,\" instead of saying, \"Aslamna\" (we embraced Islam). So Khalid ordered their execution and the execution of their prisoners (of war); `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and `Abdullah bin `Umar opposed him. This is the reason behind the dispute that occurred between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman. But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَا نَصِيفَه»</p><p>(None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,</p><p>وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْقَـعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ، وَفِي كُلَ خَيْر»</p><p>(The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,</p><p>«سَبَقَ دِرْهَمٌ مِائَةَ أَلْف»</p><p>(Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,</p><p>أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</p><p>(many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When this Ayah,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) was revealed, Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `O Allah's Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.) He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>",
    "<h2>Ordering Faith and encouraging spending</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Blessed orders having perfect faith in Him and in His Messenger, and that one should persist on this path adhereing firmly to it. Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as he was reciting and saying,</p><p>أَلْهَـكُمُ التَّكَّاثُرُ</p><p>يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَهَلْ لَكَ مِن مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَاأَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ؟»</p><p>((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, \"My wealth, my wealth.\" But is there anything belonging to you, except that which you consumed, which you used, or which you wore and then it became worn or you gave as charity and sent it forward) Muslim also collected with the addition:</p><p>«وَمَا سِوَى ذلِكَ، فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(Other than that, you will go away from it and leave it behind for other people.) Allah's statement,</p><p>فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُواْ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward.) encourages having faith and spending in acts of obedience. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord;) meaning, \"what prevents you from believing, while the Messenger is among you calling you to faith and bringing forward clear proofs and evidences that affirm the truth of what he brought you\" And we have reported the Hadith through different routes in the beginning of the explanation on the chapter on Faith in Sahih Al-Bukhari, wherein one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعْجَبُ إِلَيْكُمْ إِيمَانًا؟»</p><p>(Who do you consider among the believers as having the most amazing faith) They said, \"The angels.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»</p><p>(And what prevents them from believing when they are with their Lord) They said, \"Then the Prophets.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْوَحْيُ يَنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِمْ؟»</p><p>(What prevents them from believing when the revelation comes down to them) They said, \"Then us.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ؟ وَلكِنْ أَعْجَبُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِيمَانًا، قَوْمٌ يَجِيئُونَ بَعْدَكُمْ، يَجِدُونَ صُحُفًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(What prevents you from believing, when I am amongst you Actually, the believers who have the most amazing faith, are some people who will come after you; they will find pages that they will believe in.) We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ</p><p>(and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\")(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,</p><p>لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p>(that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تُنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.)(34:39), and,</p><p>مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</p><p>(whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain.)(16:96) Therefore, those who trust in and depend on Allah will spend, and they will not fear poverty or destitution coming to them from the Owner of the Throne. They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend.</p><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ الْفَتْحِ وَقَـتَلَ</p><p>(Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أَنفَقُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَقَـتَلُواْ وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, \"Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.'

He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>",
    "<h2>Ordering Faith and encouraging spending</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Blessed orders having perfect faith in Him and in His Messenger, and that one should persist on this path adhereing firmly to it. Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as he was reciting and saying,</p><p>أَلْهَـكُمُ التَّكَّاثُرُ</p><p>يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَهَلْ لَكَ مِن مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَاأَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ؟»</p><p>((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, \"My wealth, my wealth.\" But is there anything belonging to you, except that which you consumed, which you used, or which you wore and then it became worn or you gave as charity and sent it forward) Muslim also collected with the addition:</p><p>«وَمَا سِوَى ذلِكَ، فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(Other than that, you will go away from it and leave it behind for other people.) Allah's statement,</p><p>فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُواْ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward.) encourages having faith and spending in acts of obedience. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord;) meaning, \"what prevents you from believing, while the Messenger is among you calling you to faith and bringing forward clear proofs and evidences that affirm the truth of what he brought you\" And we have reported the Hadith through different routes in the beginning of the explanation on the chapter on Faith in Sahih Al-Bukhari, wherein one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعْجَبُ إِلَيْكُمْ إِيمَانًا؟»</p><p>(Who do you consider among the believers as having the most amazing faith) They said, \"The angels.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»</p><p>(And what prevents them from believing when they are with their Lord) They said, \"Then the Prophets.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْوَحْيُ يَنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِمْ؟»</p><p>(What prevents them from believing when the revelation comes down to them) They said, \"Then us.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ؟ وَلكِنْ أَعْجَبُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِيمَانًا، قَوْمٌ يَجِيئُونَ بَعْدَكُمْ، يَجِدُونَ صُحُفًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(What prevents you from believing, when I am amongst you Actually, the believers who have the most amazing faith, are some people who will come after you; they will find pages that they will believe in.) We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ</p><p>(and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\")(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,</p><p>لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p>(that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تُنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.)(34:39), and,</p><p>مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</p><p>(whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain.)(16:96) Therefore, those who trust in and depend on Allah will spend, and they will not fear poverty or destitution coming to them from the Owner of the Throne. They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend.</p><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ الْفَتْحِ وَقَـتَلَ</p><p>(Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أَنفَقُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَقَـتَلُواْ وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, \"Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.' When the news of this statement reached the Prophet he said,</p><p>«دَعُوا لِي أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ أَوْ مِثْلَ الْجِبَالِ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغْتُمْ أَعْمَالَهُم»</p><p>(Do not bother my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If you spend an amount of gold equal to (Mount) Uhud, (or equal to the mountains), you will not reach the level of their actions.)\" It is a known fact that Khalid bin Al-Walid, whom the Prophet addressed this statement to, embraced Islam during the period between the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the conquering of Makkah. The dispute between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman occurred because of the battle of Bani Jadhimah. The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to them after the conquest of Makkah, and they said, \"Saba'na,\" instead of saying, \"Aslamna\" (we embraced Islam). So Khalid ordered their execution and the execution of their prisoners (of war); `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and `Abdullah bin `Umar opposed him. This is the reason behind the dispute that occurred between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman. But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَا نَصِيفَه»</p><p>(None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,</p><p>وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْقَـعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ، وَفِي كُلَ خَيْر»</p><p>(The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,</p><p>«سَبَقَ دِرْهَمٌ مِائَةَ أَلْف»</p><p>(Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,</p><p>أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</p><p>(many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When this Ayah,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) was revealed, Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `O Allah's Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.) He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>",

Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah!

But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَا نَصِيفَه»</p><p>(None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,</p><p>وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْقَـعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ، وَفِي كُلَ خَيْر»</p><p>(The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,</p><p>«سَبَقَ دِرْهَمٌ مِائَةَ أَلْف»</p><p>(Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,</p><p>أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</p><p>(many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When this Ayah,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) was revealed, Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `O Allah's Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.) He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>",
    "<h2>Ordering Faith and encouraging spending</h2><p>Allah the Exalted and Blessed orders having perfect faith in Him and in His Messenger, and that one should persist on this path adhereing firmly to it. Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ</p><p>(of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as he was reciting and saying,</p><p>أَلْهَـكُمُ التَّكَّاثُرُ</p><p>يَقُولُ ابْنُ آدَمَ: مَالِي مَالِي، وَهَلْ لَكَ مِن مَالِكَ إِلَّا مَاأَكَلْتَ فَأَفْنَيْتَ، أَوْ لَبِسْتَ فَأَبْلَيْتَ، أَوْ تَصَدَّقْتَ فَأَمْضَيْتَ؟»</p><p>((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, \"My wealth, my wealth.\" But is there anything belonging to you, except that which you consumed, which you used, or which you wore and then it became worn or you gave as charity and sent it forward) Muslim also collected with the addition:</p><p>«وَمَا سِوَى ذلِكَ، فَذَاهِبٌ وَتَارِكُهُ لِلنَّاس»</p><p>(Other than that, you will go away from it and leave it behind for other people.) Allah's statement,</p><p>فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُواْ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And such of you as believe and spend, theirs will be a great reward.) encourages having faith and spending in acts of obedience. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you believe not in Allah! While the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord;) meaning, \"what prevents you from believing, while the Messenger is among you calling you to faith and bringing forward clear proofs and evidences that affirm the truth of what he brought you\" And we have reported the Hadith through different routes in the beginning of the explanation on the chapter on Faith in Sahih Al-Bukhari, wherein one day the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p>«أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعْجَبُ إِلَيْكُمْ إِيمَانًا؟»</p><p>(Who do you consider among the believers as having the most amazing faith) They said, \"The angels.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ؟»</p><p>(And what prevents them from believing when they are with their Lord) They said, \"Then the Prophets.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْوَحْيُ يَنْزِلُ عَلَيْهِمْ؟»</p><p>(What prevents them from believing when the revelation comes down to them) They said, \"Then us.\" He said,</p><p>«وَمَالَكُمْ لَا تُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَنَا بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ؟ وَلكِنْ أَعْجَبُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِيمَانًا، قَوْمٌ يَجِيئُونَ بَعْدَكُمْ، يَجِدُونَ صُحُفًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(What prevents you from believing, when I am amongst you Actually, the believers who have the most amazing faith, are some people who will come after you; they will find pages that they will believe in.) We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَدْ أَخَذَ مِيثَـقَكُمْ</p><p>(and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَـقَهُ الَّذِى وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\")(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ عَلَى عَبْدِهِ ءَايَـتٍ بَيِّنَـتٍ</p><p>(It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,</p><p>لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p>(that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُمْ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,</p><p>وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تُنفِقُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَاثُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ</p><p>(And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the best of providers.)(34:39), and,</p><p>مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</p><p>(whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain.)(16:96) Therefore, those who trust in and depend on Allah will spend, and they will not fear poverty or destitution coming to them from the Owner of the Throne. They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend.</p><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَوِى مِنكُم مَّنْ أَنفَقَ مِن قَبْلِ الْفَتْحِ وَقَـتَلَ</p><p>(Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً مِّنَ الَّذِينَ أَنفَقُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَقَـتَلُواْ وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, \"Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.' When the news of this statement reached the Prophet he said,</p><p>«دَعُوا لِي أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ أَوْ مِثْلَ الْجِبَالِ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغْتُمْ أَعْمَالَهُم»</p><p>(Do not bother my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If you spend an amount of gold equal to (Mount) Uhud, (or equal to the mountains), you will not reach the level of their actions.)\" It is a known fact that Khalid bin Al-Walid, whom the Prophet addressed this statement to, embraced Islam during the period between the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the conquering of Makkah. The dispute between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman occurred because of the battle of Bani Jadhimah. The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to them after the conquest of Makkah, and they said, \"Saba'na,\" instead of saying, \"Aslamna\" (we embraced Islam). So Khalid ordered their execution and the execution of their prisoners (of war); `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and `Abdullah bin `Umar opposed him. This is the reason behind the dispute that occurred between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman. But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنْفَقَ أَحَدُكُمْ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا، مَا بَلَغَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَا نَصِيفَه»</p><p>(None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,</p><p>وَكُلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْقَـعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِى الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَى وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَـعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,</p><p>«الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ، وَفِي كُلَ خَيْر»</p><p>(The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,</p><p>«سَبَقَ دِرْهَمٌ مِائَةَ أَلْف»</p><p>(Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him.</p><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,</p><p>أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</p><p>(many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"When this Ayah,</p><p>مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ</p><p>(Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) was revealed, Abu Ad-Dahdah Al-Ansari said, `O Allah's Messenger! Does Allah ask us for a loan' The Prophet said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ، يَاأَبَا الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(Yes, O Abu Ad-Dahdah.) He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كَمْ مِنْ عَذْقٍ رَدَاحٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاح»</p><p>(How plentiful are the sweet date clusters that Abu Ad-Dahdah has in Paradise!)\" In another narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رُبَّ نَخْلَةٍ مُدَلَّاةٍ، عُرُوقُهَا دُرٌّ وَيَاقُوتٌ، لِأَبِي الدَّحْدَاحِ فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(How many a date tree that has lowered down its clusters, which are full of pearls and gems in Paradise for Abu Ad-Dahdah!)</p>",
    "<h2>The Believers are awarded a Light on the Day of Resurrection, according to Their Good Deeds</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that the believers who spend in charity will come on the Day of Resurrection with their light preceding them in the area of the Gathering, according to the level of their good deeds. As reported from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْعَى نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ</div><p>(their light running forward before them), he said, \"They will pass over the Sirat according to their deeds. Some of them will have a light as large as a mountain, some as a date tree, some as big as a man in the standing position. The least among them has a light as big as his index finger, it is lit at times and extinguished at other times.\" Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir collected this Hadith. Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, \"Everyone will be given a light on the Day of Resurrection. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will be concerned that their light also will be extinguished, just as the light of the hypocrites was. This is when the believers will invoke Allah, `O our Lord! Perfect our light for us.\"' Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبِأَيْمَـنِهِم</div><p>(and in their right hands.) Ad-Dahhak said: \"Their Books of Records.\" As Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ</div><p>(So whosoever is given his record in his right hand.)(17:71) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ</div><p>(Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow,) meaning, it will be said to them, \"Receive glad tidings this Day, of gardens beneath which rivers flow,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ</div><p>(to dwell therein forever!), you will remain therein forever,\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</div><p>(Truly, this is the great success!)</p><h2>The Condition of the Hypocrites on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالْمُنَـفِقَـتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ</div><p>(On the Day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\") Allah informs us in this Ayah of the terrible horrors, horrendous incidents and tremendous events that will take place on the Day of Resurrection in the Gathering Area. No one will be saved on that Day, except those who believed in Allah and His Messenger, obeyed Allah's commands and avoided His prohibitions. Al-`Awfi, Ad-Dahhak and others reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"When the people are gathering in darkness, Allah will send light, and when the believers see the light they will march towards it. This light will be their guide from Allah to Paradise. When the hypocrites see the believers following the light, they will follow them. However, Allah will extinguish the light for the hypocrites and they will say (to the believers),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ</div><p>(Wait for us! Let us get something from your light.) The believers will reply by saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ارْجِعُواْ وَرَآءَكُمْ</div><p>`(Go back to your rear!) to the dark area you were in, and look for a light there!\"' Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُم بِسُورٍ لَّهُ بَابٌ بَاطِنُهُ فِيهِ الرَّحْمَةُ وَظَـهِرُهُ مِن قِبَلِهِ الْعَذَابُ</div><p>(So, a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein.

    "<h2>Reward for the Charitable, the True Believers and the Martyrs; and the Destination of the Disbelieve</h2><p>Allah the Exalted describes the reward that He will award to those who spend from their wealth, whether male or female, on the needy, the poor and the meek,</p><p>اللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً وَمَا</p><p>(and lend Allah handsome loan,) meaning, they give in charity with a good heart seeking the pleasure of Allah. They do not seek worldly rewards or appreciation from those to whom they give in charity. Allah's statement,</p><p>يُضَـعَفُ لَهُمْ</p><p>(it shall be increased manifold,) indicating that He will multiply the good deeds from tenfold, up to seven hundredfold and even more than that,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p>(and theirs shall be an honorable good reward.) theirs will be a generous, handsome reward, a good dwelling to return to and an honorable final destination. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ</p><p>(And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers -- they are the Siddiqun) This completes His description of those who have faith in Him and in His Messengers, by describing them as Siddiqun, true believers. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ</p><p>(And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers -- they are the Siddiqun) that its meaning does not continue to the next Ayah,</p><p>وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ</p><p>(and the martyrs (are) with their Lord.

Abu Ad-Duha (stopped after he) recited,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ</p><p>(they are the Siddiqun), then initiated recitation:</p><p>وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(and the martyrs (are) with their Lord.) Masruq, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others said similarly. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Ad-Duha from Masruq from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الصِّدِّيقُونَ وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(they are the Siddiqun, and the martyrs with their Lord.) \"They are of three categories,\" meaning there are those who spend in charity, the Siddiqun and the martyrs. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَالصَّـلِحِينَ</p><p>(And whoso obey Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqin, the martyrs, and the righteous.)(4:69) Therefore, Allah made a distinction between the Siddiqin and the martyrs, indicating that they are of two distinct categories, so there is no doubt that Siddiq is a better status than the martyr. Imam Malik bin Anas recorded in his Muwatta' that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ لَيَتَرَاءَوْنَ أَهْلَ الْغُرَفِ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ، كَمَا تَتَرَاءَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الدُّرِّيَّ الْغَابِرَ فِي الْأُفُقِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ أَوِ الْمَغْرِبِ، لِتَفَاضُلِ مَا بَيْنَهُم»</p><p>(The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of the lofty mansions as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the east or in the west on the horizon, because of their superiority over one another.) On that the people said, \"O Allah's Messenger! Are these lofty mansions for the Prophets whom none else can reach\" The Prophet replied,</p><p>«بَلَى، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، رِجَالٌ آمَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين»</p><p>(No! By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! these are for men who believe in Allah and believe in the Messengers.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(and the martyrs with their Lord.) means that they will be in the gardens of Paradise, as recorded in the Sahih:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَرْوَاحَ الشُّهَدَاءِ فِي حَوَاصِلِ طَيْرٍ خُضْرٍ تَسْرَحُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ شَاءَتْ، ثُمَّ تَأْوِي إِلَى تِلْكَ الْقَنَادِيلِ فَاطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّكَ اطِّلَاعَةً فَقَالَ: مَاذَا تُرِيدُونَ؟ فَقَالُوا: نُحِبُّ أَنْ تَرُدَّنَا إِلَى الدَّارِ الدُّنْيَا فَنُقَاتِلَ فِيكَ فَنُقْتَلَ، كَمَا قُتِلْنَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ، فَقَالَ: إِنِّي قَدْ قَضَيْتُ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهَا لَا يَرْجِعُون»</p><p>(The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds, who fly wherever they wish in Paradise and then return to their nests in chandeliers. Once your Lord cast a glance at them and said, `Do you want anything\" They said, \"We wish that You return us to the life of the world, so that we may fight in Your cause and be killed as we were killed the first time.\" Allah said, \"I have decreed that they shall not be returned to it again.\") Allah's statement,</p><p>لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ</p><p>(They shall have their reward and their light.), means that Allah will grant them a generous reward and a tremendous light that will precede before them. In this, the believers vary regarding the level of reward they receive, according to their good actions in the life of this world. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«الشُّهَدَاءُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ جَيِّدُ الْإِيمَانِ، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ فَقُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ الَّذِي يَنْظُرُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهِ هكَذَا»</p><p>(There are four ranks of martyrs. The first is a man who believes and who is true in faith, who meets the enemy (in battle), fulfills his duty to Allah and is killed. This is the type that the people will look up to (his level in Paradise), like this.) The Prophet raised his head until his cap fell off his head, and the same happened to `Umar. The Prophet continued,</p><p>«وَالثَّانِي مُؤْمِنٌ لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَكَأَنَّمَا يُضْرَبُ ظَهْرُهُ بِشَوْكِ الطَّلْحِ، جَاءَهُ سَهْمٌ غَرْبٌ فَقَتَلَهُ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّانِيَةِ. وَالثَّالِثُ رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ خَلَطَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَآخَرَ سَيِّئًا، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الثَّالِثَةِ. وَالرَّابِعُ رَجُلٌ مُؤْمِنٌ أَسْرَفَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ إِسْرَافًا كَثِيرًا، لَقِيَ الْعَدُوَّ فَصَدَقَ اللهَ حَتْى قُتِلَ، فَذَاكَ فِي الدَّرَجَةِ الرَّابِعَة»</p><p>(The second is a believer who meets the enemy and is struck by a stray arrow which causes him to die. This believer is in the second grade. The third is a believer who has combined good deeds with evil deeds; he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah until he is killed. This is the third category. And the fourth is a believer who has committed sins excessively, so he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah, and is killed. This is the fourth category.) `Ali bin Al-Madini also reported this Hadith and said, \"This Egyptian chain is Salih useful.\" At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَآ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p>(But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat -- they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire.) mentions the destination and the condition of the miserable ones, after Allah mentioned the destination and rewards of the happy ones.</p>",

This is the pleasure of the present world's life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.)(3:14) Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,</p><p>كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ</p><p>(Like a rain (Ghayth),) which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ</p><p>(And He it is Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.)(42:28) Allah's statement,</p><p>أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ</p><p>(thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;) meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain. And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,</p><p>ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَاهُ مُصْفَرّاً ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَاماً</p><p>(afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.) meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green. After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust. This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble. This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning. In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome. Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens. They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ</p><p>(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.)(30:54) This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming. Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,</p><p>وَفِى الاٌّخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَنٌ وَمَا الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ</p><p>(But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure. And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.) meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَما الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَـعُ الْغُرُورِ</p><p>(And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.) meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it. Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it. Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَلْجَنَّةُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَى أَحَدِكُمْ مِنْ شِرَاكِ نَعْلِهِ، وَالنَّارُ مِثْلُ ذلِك»</p><p>(Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap on his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.) Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri. This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind. If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions. By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>سَابِقُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth,) Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَسَارِعُواْ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا السَّمَـوَتُ وَالاٌّرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.)(3:133) Allah said here,</p><p>أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with.

The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.\" He asked,</p><p>«وَمَا ذَاكَ؟»</p><p>(Why is that) They said, \"They pray like us and fast as we do. However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and that free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَفَلَا أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِذَا فَعَلْتُمُوهُ سَبَقْتُمْ مَنْ بَعْدَكُمْ، وَلَا يَكُونُ أَحَدٌ أَفْضَلَ مِنْكُمْ إِلَّا مَنْ صَنَعَ مِثْلَ مَا صَنَعْتُمْ: تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتُحَمِّدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلَاةٍ ثَلَاثًا وَثَلَاثِين»</p><p>(Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you none would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same. Say, \"Glorious is Allah,\" \"Allah is Most Great,\" and \"Praise be to Allah,\" thirty three times each after every prayer.) They later came back and said, \"Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«ذلِكَ فَضْلُ اللهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَاء»</p><p>This is the favor of Allah that He gives to whom He wills.)</p>",

    "<h2>Everything that affects Mankind, is duly measured and destined</h2><p>Allah reminds of His measuring and deciding the destiny of all things before He created the creation,</p><p>مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ</p><p>(No calamity occurs on the earth nor in yourselves) meaning, `there is nothing that touches you or happens in existence,'</p><p>إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَآ</p><p>(but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees before We bring it into existence.) meaning, `before We created the creation and started life.' Qatadah commented on this Ayah,</p><p>مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(No calamity occurs on the earth) refers to famine, while,</p><p>وَلاَ فِى أَنفُسِكُمْ</p><p>(or nor in yourselves) refers to suffering and diseases.\" He also said, \"We were told that every person who suffers a prick of a thorn, a twisted ankle, or a bleeding vein, has it occur on account of his sins. What Allah forgives is even more.\" This great, honorable Ayah provides clear evidence to the misguidance of the cursed Qadariyyah sect, who deny Allah's Preordaihnent and His knowledge of everything before it occurs. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«قَدَّرَ اللهُ الْمَقَادِيرَ قَبلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَة»</p><p>(Allah ordained the measures (of everything) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.)\" Muslim collected this Hadith in his Sahih with the addition:</p><p>«وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»</p><p>(And His Throne was over the water.) At-Tirmidhi also collected it and said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, that is easy for Allah.) means that He knows all things before they occur, and He records them exactly as they will occur when they occur, and this is easy for Him. Verily, Allah knows what happened, what will happen and what did not happen, and what shape and form it will take if it were to happen.</p><h2>Ordering Patience and Gratitude</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لِّكَيْلاَ تَأْسَوْاْ عَلَى مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَفْرَحُواْ بِمَآ ءَاتَـكُمْ</p><p>(In order that you may not grieve at the things over that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you.) meaning, `We informed you of Our encompassing knowledge, recording all things before they occur and creating all things in due measure known to Us, so that you may know that what has met you would never have missed you and what has missed you would never have met you. Therefore, do not grieve for what you have missed of fortune, because had it been destined for you, you would have achieved it.' (It is also recited:) (وَلَا تَفْرَحُوْا بِمَا أَتَاكُمْ) (nor rejoice over that which came to you) meaning, come to you. According to the recitation,</p><p>ءَاتَـكُمُ</p><p>it means (which has been given to you.) Both meanings are related. Allah says here, `do not boast before people about what Allah has favored you with, because it is not you who earned it by your efforts. Rather, all this came your way because Allah destined them for you and provided them for you as provisions. Therefore, do not use what Allah has granted you as a reason to boast and become arrogant with others.' Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ</p><p>(And Allah likes not prideful boasters.) meaning, who acts arrogantly with other people. `Ikrimah commented by saying, \"Everyone of us feels happiness and grief. However, make your joy with gratitude and endure your grief with patience.\"</p><h2>Censuring the Stinginess</h2><p>Allah the Exalted then said,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ النَّاسَ بِالْبُخْلِ</p><p>(Those who are misers and enjoin miserliness upon people.) meaning those who commit evil and encourage people to commit it,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ</p><p>(And whosoever turns away,) from abiding by Allah's commandments and obeying Him,</p><p>فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ</p><p>(then Allah is Rich, Worthy of all praise.) As Musa, peace be upon him, said,</p><p>إِن تَكْفُرُواْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ</p><p>(If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.)(14:8)</p>",
    "<h2>The Prophets were given Miracles and Sent with truth and Justice</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said next,</p><p>لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</p><p>(Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs) in reference to the miracles, the unequivocal evidences and the plain proofs,</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا مَعَهُمُ الْكِتَـبَ</p><p>(and revealed with them the Scripture) which contains the true text,</p><p>وَالْمِيزَانَ</p><p>(and the Mizan), that is, justice, according to Mujahid, Qatadah and others. This Ayah refers to the truth that is attested to by the sound, straight minds that oppose misguided opinions and ideas, just as Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ</p><p>(Can they (Muslims) who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him follows it (be equal with the disbelievers).)(11:17),</p><p>فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(Allah's Fitra (religion) with which He has created mankind.) (30:30), and,</p><p>وَالسَّمَآءَ رَفَعَهَا وَوَضَعَ الْمِيزَانَ</p><p>(And the heaven: He has raised it high, and He has set up the Mizan.)(55:7) This is why Allah said here,</p><p>لِيَقُومَ النَّاسُ بِالْقِسْطِ</p><p>(that mankind may keep up justice), truth and fairness that is found in the obedience of the Messengers, in all that they conveyed from their Lord, and following all they commanded. Surely, what the Prophets brought forth is the truth, beyond which there is no truth, just as Allah said,</p><p>وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً</p><p>(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.)(6:115), His Word is true in what it conveys, and just in all its orders and prohibitions. This is why the believers say, when they take up their rooms in Paradise and assume their high grades and lined thrones,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى هَدَانَا لِهَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(All praise is due to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.)(7:43)</p><h2>The Benefits of Iron</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَنزْلْنَا الْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power,) meaning, `We made iron a deterrent for those who refuse the truth and oppose it after the proof has been established against them.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ remained in Makkah for thirteen years. During that time, the revelation continued being sent to him, containing arguments against the idolators and explaining Tawhid with detail and proofs. When the evidence was established against those who defied the Messenger ﷺ, Allah decreed the Hijrah. Then He ordered the believers to fight the disbelievers using swords, using them to strike the necks and foreheads of those who opposed, rejected and denied the Qur'an. Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ بِالسَّيْفِ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ السَّاعَةِ حَتْى يُعْبَدَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَجُعِلَ رِزْقِي تَحْتَ ظِلِّ رُمْحِي، وَجُعِلَ الذِّلَّةُ والصَّغَارُ عَلَى مَنْ خَالَفَ أَمْرِي، وَمَنْ تَشَبَّهَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُم»</p><p>(I was sent with the sword just before the Hour so that Allah be worshipped alone without partners. My provision was placed under the shadow of my spear, and those who defy my order were disgraced and humiliated, and he who imitates a people is one of them.) This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(wherein is mighty power,) in reference to weapons, such as swords, spears, daggers, arrows, shields, and so forth,</p><p>وَمَنَـفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ</p><p>(as well as many benefits for mankind,) meaning, in their livelihood, such as using it to make coins, hammers, axes, saws chisels, shovels and various tools that people use for tilting the land, sowing, cooking, making dough and manufacturing other objects necessary for their livelihood. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ وَرُسُلَهُ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(that Allah may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen.) meaning, whose intention by carrying weapons is the defense of Allah (His religion) and His Messenger,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is Powerful, Almighty.) meaning, surely, Allah is Powerful, Almighty, and He gives victory to those who give victory and aid to Him. However, Allah does not need mankind's help, but He ordered Jihad to test people with each other.</p>",
    "<h2>Many of the Nations of the Prophets were Rebellious</h2><p>Allah the Exalted states that since He sent Nuh, peace be upon him, all the Prophets and Messengers He sent after that were from his offspring. All the revealed Divine Books and all the Messengers that received revelation after Ibrahim, Allah's Khalil, peace be upon him, were from Ibrahim's offspring. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا فِى ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَـبَ</p><p>(and placed in their offspring prophethood and Scripture.) 29:27 The last among the Prophets of the Children of Israel was `Isa, son of Mary, who prophecied the good news of the coming of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon them both. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>ثُمَّ قَفَّيْنَا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم بِرُسُلِنَا وَقَفَّيْنَا بِعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَءَاتَيْنَـهُ الإِنجِيلَ</p><p>(Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent 'Isa the son of Maryam, and gave him the Injil.) refering to the Injil that Allah revealed to him,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا فِى قُلُوبِ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ</p><p>(And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him,) i.e., the disciples,</p><p>رَأْفَةٌ</p><p>(compassion) and tenderness,</p><p>وَرَحْمَةً</p><p>(and mercy.) toward the creatures. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ابتَدَعُوهَا</p><p>(But the monasticism which they invented for themselves,) refers to the monasticism that the Christian nation invented,</p><p>مَا كَتَبْنَـهَا عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(We did not prescribe for them) `We -- Allah -- did not ordain it for them, but they chose it on their own.' There are two opinions about the meaning of,</p><p>إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ رِضْوَنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(only to please Allah therewith,) The first is that they wanted to please Allah by inventing monasticism. Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah said this. The second meaning is: \"We did not ordain them to practice that but, rather, We ordained them only to seek what pleases Allah.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا</p><p>(but that they did not observe it with the right observance.) meaning, they did not abide by what they ordered themselves to do. This Ayah criticizes them in two ways: first, they invented in things in their religion, things which Allah did not legislate for them. The second is that they did not fulfill the requirements of what they themselves invented and which they claimed was a means of drawing near to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. GIbn Jarir and Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i -- and this is his wording - recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"There were kings after `Isa who changed the Tawrah and the Injil when there were still believers who recited Tawrah and the Injil. Their kings were told, `We were never confronted by more severe criticism and abuse than of these people.' -- they recite the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the disbelievers.)(5:44), as well as, they accuse us of short comings in our actions, while still they recite. Therefore, summon them and let them recite these Ayat our way and believe in them our way.' The king summoned them and gathered them and threatened them with death if they did not revert from reciting the original Tawrah and Injil to using the corrupted version only. They said, `Why do you want us to do that, let us be.' Some of them said, `Build a narrow elevated tower for us and let us ascend it, and then give us the means to elevate food and drink to us. This way, you will save yourselves from hearing us.' Another group among them said, `Let us go about in the land and eat and drink like beasts do, and if you find us in your own land, then kill us.' Another group among them said, `Build homes (monasteries) for us in the deserts and secluded areas, where we can dig wells and plant vegetables. Then, we will not refute you and will not even pass by you.' These groups said this, even though they all had supporters among their tribes. It is about this that Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p><p>وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ابتَدَعُوهَا مَا كَتَبْنَـهَا عَلَيْهِمْ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ رِضْوَنِ اللَّهِ فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا</p><p>(But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please Allah therewith, but that they did not observe it with the right observance.) \"' Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«لِكُلِّ نَبِيَ رَهْبَانِيَّةٌ، وَرَهْبَانِيَّةُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p><p>(Every Prophet has Rahbaniyyah (monasticism); Jihad in the cause of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, is the Rahbaniyyah of this Ummah.) Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la collected this Hadith and in this narration, the Prophet said,</p><p>«لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَهْبَانِيَّةٌ، وَرَهْبَانِيَّةُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</p><p>(Every Ummah has Rahbaniyyah; Jihad in the cause of Allah is the Rahbaniyyah of this Ummah.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that a man came to him and asked him for advice, and Abu Sa`id said that he asked the same of Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Abu Sa`id said, \"So, I advise you to adhere by the Taqwa of Allah, because it is the chief of all matters. Fulfill the obligation of Jihad, because it is the Rahbaniyyah of Islam. Take care of remembering Allah and reciting the Qur'an, because it is your closeness (or status) in the heavens and your good fame on earth.\" Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p>",

    "<h2>The Believers of the People of the Scriptures will earn Double their Rewards</h2><p>Earlier we mentioned a Hadith that An-Nasa'i collected from Ibn `Abbas that this Ayah is about the People of the Scriptures who believe in Islam, and that they will earn double their reward if they do so. There is an Ayah in Surat Al-Qasas to support this meaning. Also, there is a Hadith from Ash-Sha`bi from Abu Burdah from his father from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«ثَلَاثَةٌ يُؤْتَوْنَ أَجْرَهُمْ مَرَّتَيْنِ: رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ آمَنَ بِنَبِيِّهِ وَآمَنَ بِي فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَعَبْدٌ مَمْلُوكٌ أَدَّى حَقَّ اللهِ وَحَقَّ مَوَالِيهِ فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَرَجُلٌ أَدَّبَ أَمَتَهُ فَأَحْسَنَ تَأْدِيبَهَا، ثُمَّ أَعْتَقَهَا وَتَزَوَّجَهَا فَلَهُ أَجْرَان»</p><p>(Three will get their reward twice. A believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer in his Prophet and then believes in me, will get a double reward. A slave who fulfills Allah's rights and obligations as well as the duties of his master, will get a double reward. A person who has a slave-girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and marries her, will get a double reward.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ad-Dahhak, `Utbah bin Abi Hakim and others agreed with Ibn `Abbas in this, and Ibn Jarir preferred it. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>يِـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إَن تَتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(O you who believe! If you have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you a criterion, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is Owner of the great bounty.)(8:29) Sa`id bin `Abdul-`Aziz said, `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked a Jewish rabbi, `What is the maximum a reward would be increased for you' He replied, `A Kifl (portion) which is about three hundred and fifty good merits.' So `Umar said, `Praise be to Allah who gave us two Kifls.' Then Sa`id mentioned Allah's saying:</p><p>يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ</p><p>(He will give you a double portion of His mercy,) Sa`id said, \"And the two Kifls on Friday are similar to that.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. This view has support from the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَعْمَلَ عُمَّالًا فَقَالَ: مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ قِيرَاطٍ؟ أَلَا فَعَمِلَتِ الْيَهُودُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ صَلَاةِ الظُّهْرِ إِلَى صَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ قِيرَاطٍ؟ أَلَا فَعَمِلَتِ النَّصَارَى، ثُمَّ قَالَ: مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ صَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ عَلَى قِيرَاطَيْنِ قِيرَاطَيْنِ؟ أَلَا فَأَنْتُمُ الَّذِينَ عَمِلْتُمْ، فَغَضِبَ النَّصَارَى وَالْيَهُودُ وَقَالُوا: نَحْنُ أَكْثَرُ عَمَلًا وَأَقَلُّ عَطَاءً، قَالَ: هَلْ ظَلَمْتُكُمْ مِنْ أَجْرِكُمْ شَيْئًا؟ قَالُوا: لَا، قَالَ: فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ فَضْلِي أُوتِيهِ مَنْ أَشَاء»</p><p>(The parable of you and the Jews and Christians is that of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, \"Who will work for me from the Dawn prayer until midday for one Qirat (a special weight of gold) each\" So, the Jews worked. The person asked, \"Who will do the work for me from the Zuhr prayer to the time of the `Asr prayer for one Qirat each\" So, the Christians worked. Then the person asked, \"Who will do the work for me from `Asr prayer until sunset for two Qirat each\" You are those who did this work. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, \"We did more work, but got less wages.\" Allah said, \"Have I been unjust to you with your reward\" They said, \"No.\" So, Allah said, \"Then it is My grace which I bestow on whomever I will.\") Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Musa said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَثَلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَالْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَى كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَعْمَلَ قَوْمًا يَعْمَلُونَ لَهُ عَمَلًا يَوْمًا إِلَى اللَّيْلِ عَلَى أَجْرٍ مَعْلُومٍ، فَعَمِلُوا إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ فَقَالُوا: لَا حَاجَةَ لَنَا فِي أَجْرِكَ الَّذِي شَرَطْتَ لَنَا، وَمَا عَمِلْنَا بَاطِلٌ، فَقَالَ لَهُمْ: لَا تَفْعَلُوا، أَكْمِلُوا بَقِيَّةَ عَمَلِكُمْ، وَخُذُوا أَجْرَكُمْ كَامِلًا، فَأَبَوا وَتَرَكُوا وَاسْتَأْجَرَ آخَرِينَ بَعْدَهُمْ فَقَالَ: أَكْمِلُوا بَقِيَّةَ يَوْمِكُمْ وَلَكُمُ الَّذِي شَرَطْتُ لَهُمْ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ، فَعَمِلُوا حَتْى إِذَا كَانَ حِينَ صَلَّوُا الْعَصْرَ قَالُوا: مَا عَمِلْنَا بَاطِلٌ، وَلَكَ الْأَجْرُ الَّذِي جَعَلْتَ لَنَا فِيهِ. فَقَالَ: أَكْمِلُوا بَقِيَّةَ عَمَلِكُمْ، فَإِنَّمَا بَقِيَ مِنَ النَّهَارِ شَيْءٌ يَسِيرٌ، فَأَبَوا. فَاسْتَأْجَرَ قَوْمًا أَنْ يَعْمَلُوا لَهُ بَقِيَّةَ يَوْمِهِمْ فَعَمِلُوا لَهُ بَقِيَّةَ يَوْمِهِمْ حَتْى غَابَتِ الشَّمْسُ، فَاسْتَكْمَلُوا أُجْرَةَ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ كِلَيْهِمَا، فَذلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ وَمَثَلُ مَا قَبِلُوا مِنْ هذَا النُّور»</p><p>(The parable of the Muslims, Jews and Christians is that of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning until night for a known wage. So, they worked until midday and said, `We are not in need of the wages that you promised and our work was in vain.' So, the man said, `Do not quit now, complete the rest of the work and yours will be the full wage I have fixed for it.' However, they refused and quit, and he had to hire another batch of workers. He said (to the second batch), `Complete the work for the rest of the day and I will give you the same wage I promised the first batch.' So, they worked until the time of the `Asr prayer and said, `Whatever we have done is in vain and we forfeit the wages you promised us.' He said to them, `Complete your day's work, for only a small part of the day remains.' However, they refused, and he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day, and they worked until sunset and received the wages of the two former batches. This is an example of them (i.e., the Jews and Christians) and of those who accepted this light (i.e., Islam).) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording it. Allah the Exalted said;</p><p>لِّئَلاَّ يَعْلَمَ أَهْلُ الْكِتَـبِ أَلاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مِّن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(So that the People of the Scriptures may know that they have no power whatsoever over the grace of Allah,) meaning, so that they become sure that they cannot prevent what Allah gives, or give what Allah prevents,</p><p>وَأَنَّ الْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(and that (His) grace is (entirely) in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty.) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hadid, all praise is due to Allah, and all favors come from Him.</p>",
    "<h2>The Believers of the People of the Scriptures will earn Double their Rewards</h2><p>Earlier we mentioned a Hadith that An-Nasa'i collected from Ibn `Abbas that this Ayah is about the People of the Scriptures who believe in Islam, and that they will earn double their reward if they do so. There is an Ayah in Surat Al-Qasas to support this meaning. Also, there is a Hadith from Ash-Sha`bi from Abu Burdah from his father from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«ثَلَاثَةٌ يُؤْتَوْنَ أَجْرَهُمْ مَرَّتَيْنِ: رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ آمَنَ بِنَبِيِّهِ وَآمَنَ بِي فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَعَبْدٌ مَمْلُوكٌ أَدَّى حَقَّ اللهِ وَحَقَّ مَوَالِيهِ فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَرَجُلٌ أَدَّبَ أَمَتَهُ فَأَحْسَنَ تَأْدِيبَهَا، ثُمَّ أَعْتَقَهَا وَتَزَوَّجَهَا فَلَهُ أَجْرَان»</p><p>(Three will get their reward twice. A believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer in his Prophet and then believes in me, will get a double reward. A slave who fulfills Allah's rights and obligations as well as the duties of his master, will get a double reward. A person who has a slave-girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and marries her, will get a double reward.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ad-Dahhak, `Utbah bin Abi Hakim and others agreed with Ibn `Abbas in this, and Ibn Jarir preferred it. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p>يِـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إَن تَتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p>(O you who believe! If you have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you a criterion, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is Owner of the great bounty.)(8:29) Sa`id bin `Abdul-`Aziz said, `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked a Jewish rabbi, `What is the maximum a reward would be increased for you' He replied, `A Kifl (portion) which is about three hundred and fifty good merits.' So `Umar said, `Praise be to Allah who gave us two Kifls.' Then Sa`id mentioned Allah's saying:</p><p>يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ</p><p>(He will give you a double portion of His mercy,) Sa`id said, \"And the two Kifls on Friday are similar to that.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir.
