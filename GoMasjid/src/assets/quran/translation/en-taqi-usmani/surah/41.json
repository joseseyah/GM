    "Hā Mīm",
    "This is a revelation from the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful-",
    "- a book whose verses are elaborated in the form of an Arabic Qur’ān for a people who understand,",
    "as a bearer of good news and warning. Yet most of them turned away, so they do not listen.",
    "And they say, “Our hearts are (wrapped) in covers against that (faith) to which you invite us, and there is deafness in our ears, and there is a barrier between you and us. So, do (in your way). We too are doing (in our own way)”.",
    "Say, “I am but a human being like you; it is revealed to me that your god is only One God. So, turn straight towards Him, and seek forgiveness from Him, and woe to the Mushriks (those who ascribe partners to Allah)",
    "who do not pay Zakāh ; and of the life of the Hereafter, they are deniers.”",
    "As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them there is a reward that will never be interrupted.",
    "Say, “Do you really disbelieve in the One who has created the earth in two days, and ascribe to Him partners? That is the Lord of the worlds.",
    "He has placed firm mountains in it (the earth) towering above it, and put blessings in it, and proportioned its foods therein, in four days, equal for those who ask.",
    "Then He turned straight to the sky, while it was a smoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come (to My obedience), both of you, willingly or unwillingly.” Both said, “We come willingly.”",
    "So He accomplished them as seven skies in two days, and settled in every sky its (due) thing. And We have decorated the closest sky with lamps, and protected it properly. All this is the determination of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.",
    "So, if they turn away, then say, “I have warned you of a calamity like the calamity of ‘Ād and Thamūd,",
    "when the messengers came to them from their front and from their rear, saying, “Do not worship anyone but Allah.” They said, “Had our Lord (really) willed (to send someone as messenger), He would have sent down angels. So, we are deniers of what you have been sent with.”",
    "As for ‘Ād, they showed arrogance in the land with no right (to do so), and said, “Who is stronger than us in power?” Did they not see that Allah, who created them, is stronger than them in power? And they used to reject Our signs.",
    "So, We let loose a wild wind on them in unlucky days to make them taste the humiliating punishment in the present life. And of course, the punishment of the Hereafter will be much more humiliating, and they will not be helped.",
    "As for Thamūd, We showed them the way, but they preferred blindness to the guidance. Therefore, they were seized by the bang of the abasing punishment because of what they used to earn.",
    "And We saved those who believed and used to be God-fearing.",
    "(Remind them of) the day when Allah’s enemies will be mustered towards the Fire. So they will be kept under control,",
    "until when they will come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will testify against them about what they used to do.",
    "And they will say to their skins, “Why did you testify against us?” They (the skins) will say, “We were made to speak by Allah, the One who has made every thing to speak.” And He had created you the first time, and to Him you are going to be returned.",
    "And you had not been hiding your selves (when committing sins) from your ears and your eyes and your skins that would bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know much of what you did.",
    "This thought of yours that you conceived about your Lord brought you to ruin, and you became among the losers.",
    "Now, if they endure patiently, even then the Fire is their abode, and if they seek forgiveness, they are not among those (who could be) forgiven.",
    "And We had assigned for them fellows (in the worldly life) who beautified for them what was before them and what was behind them. And (thus) the word (of punishment) became due against them along with the communities that passed before them from Jinns and human beings. Surely they were the losers.",
    "And said those who disbelieved, “Do not listen to this Qur’ān, and make noise during its recitation, so that you may overcome.”",
    "So, We will certainly make them taste a severe punishment, and will certainly recompense them for the worst of what they used to do.",
    "That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah- the Fire. For them there is the eternal home, as a recompense for their persistent denial of Our verses.",
    "And those who disbelieve will say, “Our Lord, show us the two, out of the Jinns and the humans, who led us astray and we will put both of them under our feet, so that they become among the lowest.”",
    "Surely, those who have declared: “Our Lord is Allah”, then remained steadfast, on them the angels will descend, saying, “Do not fear, and do not grieve; and be happy with the good news of the Jannah (Paradise) that you had been promised.",
    "We have been your friends in the worldly life, and (will remain as such) in the Hereafter. And for you here is whatever your souls desire, and for you here is whatever you call for",
    "- a gift of welcome from the Most-forgiving, the Very-Merciful”.",
    "Who can be better in words than the one who calls towards Allah, and acts righteously and says, “I am one of those who submit themselves (to Allah)”?",
    "Good and evil are not equal. Repel (evil) with what is best, and you will see that the one you had mutual enmity with him will turn as if he were a close friend.",
    "And no one is blessed with this (attitude) but those who observe patience, and no one is blessed with this (attitude) but a man of great luck.",
    "And should a stroke from ShaiTān (Satan) strike you, seek refuge with Allah. Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun, or to the moon. And prostrate yourselves to Allah who has created them, if it is Him whom you worship.",
    "Still, if they show arrogance, then those who are with your Lord proclaim His purity night and day, and they do not get weary.",
    "And among His signs is that you see the land inactive; then, once We send down water thereto, it gets excited and swells. Surely, the One who has given life to it is the One who gives life to the dead. No doubt, He is powerful to do everything.",
    "Surely those who adopt perversity about Our verses are not hidden from Us. So, tell me which one is better: the one who is thrown into the Fire, or the one who will come safely on the Day of Judgment? Do whatever you wish. He is watchful of whatever you do.",
    "Surely those who have rejected the advice (the Qur’ān) when it came to them (are the ones who adopted perversity, and are not hidden from Us). And surely, it is an unassailable book",
    "that cannot be approached by falsehood, neither from its front, nor from its behind -a revelation from the All-Wise, the Ever-Praised.",
    "Nothing is being said to you but what has been said to the messengers before you. Your Lord is certainly the Lord of forgiveness and the Lord of painful punishment.",
    "Had We made it a non-Arabic Qur’ān, they would have said, “Why are its verses not clearly explained? Is it a non-Arabic (book) and an Arab (messenger)?” Say, “For those who believe, it is guidance and cure. As for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears, and for them it is blindness. Such people are being called from a distant place.”",
    "And We gave Mūsā the book, then it was disputed (as well). But for a word that had already come from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them. They are in confounding doubt about it.",
    "If someone acts righteously, he does so for the benefit of his own soul, and if someone commits evil, he does so against it. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants.",
    "To Him alone the knowledge of the Hour (the exact time of Doomsday) is to be referred. No fruits come out of their sheaths, nor does a female conceive a baby, nor does she deliver it, but with His knowledge. And (remember) the Day when He will call them: “Where are My partners?” They will say, “We declare to you that no one of us is to testify (that you have partners).”",
    "And whatever they used to invoke earlier will vanish from them, and they will realize that they have no way to escape.",
    "Man does not get weary of craving for (all sorts of ) good things; and if he is touched by some evil, he is disappointed, devoid of any hope.",
    "And if We give him a taste of some mercy from Us after some hardship that has touched him, he will surely say, “This is my right. And I do not think the Hour (the Day of Judgment) is going to occur. And even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely have the best (life) with Him (too).”So, We will let the disbelievers know what they did, and let them taste a stern punishment.",
    "When We bestow Our favor upon man, he avoids (to appreciate it) and keeps himself far aside (from obedience), and when some evil touches him, he is full of lengthy prayers.",
    "Say (to the disbelievers), “Tell me, if it (the Qur’ān) is from Allah, and still you reject it, then who can be more erroneous than him who is (involved) in far reaching schism?”",
    "We will show them Our signs in the universe and within their own beings until it will become manifest to them that it is the truth. Is it not enough about your Lord that He is witness to everything?",
    "Beware, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord. Beware, He is the One who encompasses everything."
