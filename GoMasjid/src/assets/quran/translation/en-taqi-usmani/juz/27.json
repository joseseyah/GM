    "He (Ibrāhīm) said (to the angels), “Then, what is your mission O messengers?”",
    "They said, “We are sent to a guilty people, (i.e. the people of Sodom)",
    "so that we may send down upon them stones of clay,",
    "marked by your Lord for the transgressors.”",
    "So, We let the believers who were there to come out (from danger),",
    "but We did not find in it any Muslims, except one house.",
    "And We left in this (event) a sign (of deterrence) for those who fear the painful punishment.",
    "And (We left a similar sign) in (the story of) Mūsā, when We sent him to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) with a clear proof.",
    "So he turned away along with his chiefs and said, “ (Mūsā is) a magician or a madman!”",
    "So We seized him and his army, and cast them into the sea, as he was of culpable behaviour.",
    "And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) ‘Ād, when We sent upon them the wind that was barren (from any benefit);",
    "it spared nothing it came upon, but rendered it like a stuff smashed by decay.",
    "And (a similar sign was left) in (the story of) Thamūd, when it was said to them, “Enjoy yourselves for a while.”",
    "Then they rebelled against the command of your Lord; so the thunderbolt (of divine punishment) seized them, while they were looking on.",
    "Then they were neither able to stand (before the punishment), nor could they defend themselves.",
    "And (We have destroyed) the people of NūH even before; indeed they were a sinful people.",
    "And the sky was built by Us with might; and indeed We are the expanders.",
    "And the earth was spread out by Us as a floor; so how well have We spread it out!",
    "And from every thing We have created pairs of twos, so that you may heed.",
    "So, flee to Allah. Indeed I am a plain warner sent by Him for you.",
    "And do not make up any other god along with Allah. Indeed I am a plain warner sent by Him for you.",
    "In similar way, no messenger came to those before them, but they said, “(He is) a magician or a madman.”",
    "Have they handed down (this saying) to each other as a legacy? Rather they are a rebellious people.",
    "So, turn away from them, for you are not blamed.",
    "And keep reminding, because reminding benefits the believers.",
    "I did not create the Jinns and the human beings except for the purpose that they should worship Me.",
    "I do not want any sustenance from them, nor do I want them to feed Me.",
    "In fact, Allah is the All-Sustainer, Possessor of power, the Strong.",
    "So, those who did wrong will have their turn like the turn of their counterparts. So, they should not ask Me to hasten on.",
    "Woe, then, to those who disbelieve because of the Day of theirs that they are promised (for punishment).",
    "By the mount of Tūr,",
    "and by a book, written",
    "on an unrolled scroll,",
    "and by the Populated House (Al-Bait-ul-Ma‘mūr) ,",
    "and by the roof, raised high,",
    "and by the sea, flared up (with fire),",
    "the punishment of your Lord is sure to fall.",
    "There is nothing to push it back,",
    "the Day when the sky will tremble, a horrible trembling,",
    "and the mountains will move about, a terrible movement.",
    "So, woe to those who reject (the true faith),",
    "who are indulged in vain talk, playing (with truth),",
    "the Day they will be pushed to the Fire forcefully,",
    "(and it will be said to them,) “This is the Fire you used to deny.",
    "Is it then magic, or do you not see?",
    "Enter it. Now, whether you endure (it) patiently or impatiently, it is all the same for you; you are merely rewarded for what you used to do.”",
    "Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and bliss,",
    "enjoying what their Lord will have given to them, and their Lord will have saved them from the punishment of Hell.",
    "(It will be said to them,) “Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you used to do,",
    "relaxing on lined up couches”. And We will marry them with big-eyed houris.",
    "And those who believed and their children followed them in belief, We will join their children with them, and will not curtail (the reward of) any of their deeds at all. Every person will be pledged for what he earned.",
    "And We will go on giving them whatever they desire of fruits and meat.",
    "They will snatch from one another (in a friendly manner) a glass (of wine) carrying neither absurd talk, nor something leading to sin.",
    "And their own serving boys will rotate around them, (who will be as neat and clean) as if they were hidden pearls.",
    "And they will advance to one another, asking (about each other’s welfare).",
    "They will say, “Indeed we were afraid (of Allah’s punishment) when we were amidst our family,",
    "but Allah did favour to us and saved us from the torment of Fire’s scorching breath.",
    "We used to pray to Him before. He is surely the Most-Kind, the Very-Merciful.",
    "So keep reminding (them), because by the grace of your Lord, you are neither a soothsayer, nor a mad man.",
    "Do they rather say, “He is a poet for whom we are awaiting the accident of death?”",
    "Say, “Wait! I am waiting with you, too.”",
    "Is it their intellects that direct them to (say) this, or are they a rebellious people?",
    "Do they rather say, “He has forged it (the Qur’ān.)”? No, but they do not believe.",
    "So, let them bring a discourse like this, if they are truthful.",
    "Is it that they are created by none, or are they themselves the creators?",
    "Or have they created the heavens and the earth? No, but they are sure of nothing.",
    "Or do they have the treasures of your Lord, or have they acquired control (over them)?",
    "Or have they a stairway (to the heavens) by means of which they listen (to the divine decrees)? If so, their listener must bring a clear proof.",
    "Is it that He has daughters and you have sons?",
    "Or is it that you (O prophet) ask them for a fee, and therefore they are burdened with a liability?",
    "Or have they the knowledge of the Unseen, and they are recording it?",
    "Or do they intend to plan to do harm (to the prophet)? Then the disbelievers themselves shall be harmed by the plan.",
    "Or do they have a god other than Allah? Pure is Allah from what they associate with Him.",
    "Even if they see a piece falling down from the sky, they would say, “It is a cumulated cloud.”",
    "So, leave them alone until they face their Day, in which they will be turned unconscious,",
    "the Day their planning will not benefit them in the least, nor will they be helped.",
    "And for those who did wrong there is another punishment before that, but most of them do not know.",
    "And (O Prophet) be patient about the decision of your Lord, because you are in front of Our Eyes. And proclaim the purity of your Lord along with His praise when you stand (in Prayer),",
    "And, in parts of night too, proclaim His purity, and at the time of setting of the stars.",
    "By the star when it goes down to set,",
    "your fellow (the Holy Prophet) has neither missed the way, nor did he deviate.",
    "He does not speak out of (his own) desire.",
    "It is but revelation revealed (to him).",
    "It is taught to him by one (angel) of strong faculties,",
    "the one of vigour. So he stood poised,",
    "while he was on the upper horizon.",
    "Then he drew near, and came down,",
    "so as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined together), rather even nearer.",
    "Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed.",
    "The heart did not err in what he saw.",
    "Do you quarrel with him in what he sees?",
    "Indeed he saw him another time",
    "by Sidrat-ul-Muntahā (the lote-tree in the upper realm),",
    "near which there is Jannat-ul-Ma’wā (the Paradise of Abode),",
    "when the lote-tree was covered by that which covered it.",
    "The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit.",
    "He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your Lord.",
    "Have you ever considered about the (idols of) Lāt and ‘Uzzā,",
    "and about the other, the third (idol), namely, Manāt,?",
    "Is it that you have males and He (Allah) has females?",
    "If so, it is a bizarre division.",
    "These are nothing but names you and your fathers have invented; Allah has sent down no authority attached to them. They are following nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire, while guidance from their Lord has surely reached them.",
    "Is it that man can get whatever he wishes?",
    "(No,) because to Allah alone belongs the (good of) the Hereafter and the former life (of this world).",
    "How many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession cannot benefit (any one) at all, but after Allah allows (it) for whomsoever He wills and pleases.",
    "Those who do not believe in the Hereafter call the angels by names of females.",
    "They do not have knowledge about it. They follow nothing but conjecture, and conjecture is of no avail in (the matter of) Truth.",
    "So, turn away from him who turns away from Our advice, and seeks nothing but (pleasure of) the worldly life.",
    "That is the limit of their access to knowledge. Indeed only your Lord knows well about the one who has gone astray from his way, and He knows well about the one who has adopted the right path.",
    "To Allah belongs whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth, so that He gives punishment to evildoers for what they did, and gives good reward to those who did good",
    "-those who abstain from the major sins and from shameful acts, except minor involvements. Indeed your Lord is extensive in forgiveness. He knows you more than anyone else (from a time) when He created you from the earth and when you were embryos in the wombs of your mothers. So, do not claim purity (from faults) for your selves. He knows best who is God-fearing.",
    "Did you see the one who turned away,",
    "and gave a little, and stopped?",
    "Does he have knowledge of the Unseen whereby he sees (what he believes)?",
    "Has he not been told of what was (revealed) in the scriptures of Mūsā",
    "and of Ibrāhīm who fulfilled (his duties)?",
    "(It was) that no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of the other,",
    "and that a man shall not deserve but (the reward of) his own effort,",
    "and that his effort will soon be seen,",
    "then he will be recompensed for it in full,",
    "and that to your Lord is the end (of every one),",
    "and that He is the One who makes (one) laugh and makes (him) weep,",
    "and that He is the One who gives death and gives life,",
    "and that He creates the pairs, male and female,",
    "from a sperm-drop when it is poured (into a womb),",
    "and that the second creation is undertaken by Him,",
    "and that He is the One who gives wealth and preserves (it),",
    "and that He is the One who is the Lord of Sirius (the star worshipped by pagans),",
    "and that He has destroyed the earlier ‘Ād,",
    "and Thamūd, so spared none,",
    "and (destroyed) the people of NūH even earlier. Surely they were more unjust and more rebellious.",
    "And He destroyed the overturned towns (of the people of LūT) also,",
    "so enveloped they were by that which enveloped.",
    "Then concerning which of your Lord’s bounties would you remain in doubt?",
    "This (Prophet) is a warner from the (genus of the) previous warners.",
    "The Imminent (Hour of Judgment) has approached.",
    "There is no one, beside Allah, to remove it.",
    "Do you then wonder at this discourse,",
    "and laugh (at it), and not weep,",
    "while you are engaged in vain play?",
    "Now, fall down in prostration and worship (Allah).",
    "The Hour (of doom) has drawn near, and the moon has split asunder.",
    "When these people see a sign, they turn away and say, “(This is) a transient magic.”",
    "They have rejected (the Truth) and followed their desires, while every matter has to settle (at some time).",
    "And there has come to them as much news (of the earlier communities) as it is enough to deter,",
    "(containing) a perfect wisdom. But the warnings are of no avail (to them).",
    "Therefore, turn aside (O Prophet,) from them. (They will see the reality) on the day in which the caller will call (them) to a gruesome object.",
    "With their eyes humbled, they will come out of the graves like locusts spread all over,",
    "rushing quickly towards the caller. (On that Day) the disbelievers will say, “This is a hard day.”",
    "The people of NūH denied (the truth) before them. So they rejected Our servant, and said, “(He is) a madman”, and he was (also) threatened (by them).",
    "So he prayed to his Lord saying, “I am overpowered, so defend (me).”",
    "So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth profusely,",
    "and We caused the earth to gush forth as springs; so the water (of both kinds) met together for a destined event.",
    "And We caused him (NūH) to board that (ship) which had planks and nails,",
    "which sailed under Our Eyes, as a reward for the one who was rejected (by the infidels).",
    "And We left it (the ship) as a sign. So, is there one to take lesson?",
    "Then how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "(The people of) ‘Ād rejected (their prophet). So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "We did send to them a furious wind in a day of continuous misfortune,",
    "plucking people away, as if they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.",
    "So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "(The people of) Thamūd rejected the warners.",
    "So they said, “Shall we follow a single human being from among us? Then we will be in error and insanity.",
    "Is it that the advice has been cast upon him alone out of all of us? No, but he is a bragging liar.”",
    "Tomorrow they will know who the bragging liar is!",
    "We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch them (O SāliH,) and keep patience,",
    "and tell them that water (of the well) is to be shared between them (and the she-camel), so as the right of having water shall be attended by each (alternatively).",
    "Then they called their man (to kill the she-camel,) so he undertook (the task) and killed (the she-camel).",
    "So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "We sent upon them a single Cry, and they were like crushed leafs of a hedge-builder.",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "The people of LūT rejected the warners.",
    "We sent upon them a rain of stones, except the family of LūT whom We saved in the last hours of night,",
    "as a grace from Us. This is how We reward the one who offers gratitude.",
    "And he (LūT) had certainly warned them of Our grasp, but they disputed the warnings.",
    "And they had even tried to tempt him against his guests (so that they may snatch them away for bad purpose,) but We blinded their eyes: “Now taste My torment and My warnings!”",
    "And on the next morning, a lasting torment overtook them:",
    "“Now taste My torment and My warnings.”",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "And the warners came to the family of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).",
    "(But) they rejected all Our signs; so We seized them- a seizure by One Mighty, Powerful.",
    "Are the disbelievers among you in a better position than all of the aforesaid (punished people), or do you have immunity (recorded) in the sacred books?",
    "Or do they say, “We are a large group, well-defended.”?",
    "Soon this ‘large group’ shall be defeated, and all of them will turn their backs.",
    "Rather the Hour (of judgment) is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour is more calamitous and much more bitter.",
    "Surely the guilty ones are in error and madness.",
    "On the Day when they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, (it will be said to them,) “Taste the touch of Hell.”",
    "Verily, We have created every thing according to (Our) predestination.",
    "And (implementation of) Our command is no more than a single act like the twinkling of an eye.",
    "We have destroyed people like you; so, is there one to take lesson?",
    "And every thing they have done is recorded in the books (of deeds).",
    "And every thing, small and big, is written down.",
    "Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and rivers,",
    "in a seat of Truth, near to the Omnipotent Sovereign.",
    "The RaHmān (The All-Merciful Allah)",
    "has taught the Qur’ān.",
    "He has created man.",
    "He has taught him (how) to express himself.",
    "The sun and the moon are (bound) by a (fixed) calculation.",
    "And the vine and the tree both prostrate (to Allah).",
    "He raised the sky high, and has placed the scale,",
    "so that you should not be wrongful in weighing.",
    "Observe the correct weight with fairness, and do not make weighing deficient.",
    "As for the earth, He has placed it for creatures,",
    "in which there are fruits and date palms having sheaths,",
    "and the grain having chaff, and fragrant flowers.",
    "So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "He has created man from dry clay, ringing like pottery,",
    "and created Jann (father of the Jinn) from a smokeless flame of fire.",
    "So, (O mankind and Jinn,) which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "He is the Lord of both points of sunrise and both points of sunset.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "He let forth the two seas to meet together,",
    "while there is a barrier between them; they do not encroach (upon one another).",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "From both of them come forth the pearl and the coral.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "And His are the sailing ships raised up in the sea like mountains.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "Every one who is on it (the earth) has to perish.",
    "And your Lord’s Countenance will remain, full of majesty, full of honour.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "All those in the heavens and the earth beseech Him (for their needs.) Every day He is in a state of action.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "Soon We are going to spare Ourselves for you (to reckon your deeds), O two heavy species (of Jinn and mankind)!",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "O genera of Jinn and mankind, If you are able to penetrate beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate. You cannot penetrate without power.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "A flame of fire and a smoke will be loosed against you, and you will not (be able) to defend.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "So, (it will be a terrible event) when the sky will be split apart and will become rosy, like (red) hides.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "On that day, neither a man will be questioned about his sin, nor a Jinn.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "The guilty ones will be recognized (by angels) through their marks and will be seized by foreheads and feet.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "This is Jahannam (Hell) that the guilty people deny.",
    "They will circle around between it and between hot, boiling water.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "And for the one who is fearful of having to stand before his Lord, there are two gardens, -",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "- both having branches.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In both there are two flowing springs.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In both there are two kinds of every fruit.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "(The people of these gardens will be) reclining on floorings whose (even) linings will be of thick silk, and the fruits plucked from the two gardens will be at hand.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In them there will be maidens restraining (their) glances, whom neither a man might have touched before them, nor a Jinn.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "They will look like rubies and corals.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "Is there any reward for goodness other than goodness?",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "And besides these two, there are two other gardens (for the second category of the God-fearing),-",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "- both (gardens are) dark green!",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In both there are two springs gushing forth profusely.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In both there are fruits and date-palms and pomegranates.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "In them there will be women, good and gorgeous,-",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "- the houris, kept guarded in pavilions-",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "- whom neither a man might have touched before them, nor a Jinn.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "(The people of these gardens will be) reclining on green cushions and marvelously beautiful mattresses.",
    "So, which of the bounties of your Lord will you deny?",
    "Glorious is the name of your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, the Lord of Honour.",
    "When the Imminent Event (of Doom) will occur,",
    "there will be no one to deny its occurrence.",
    "It will be abasing (some), exalting (others)",
    "when the earth will be jolted with a terrible jolt,",
    "and the mountains will be crumbled a thorough crumbling,",
    "until they will become dust, scattered in the air,",
    "and you will be (divided into) three categories.",
    "As for the People of the Right, how (lucky) are the People of the Right!",
    "And the People of the Left ? How (wretched) are the People of the Left!",
    "And the Foremost are the foremost.",
    "Those are the ones blessed with nearness (to Allah)",
    "in gardens of bliss,",
    "many from the first generations,",
    "and a few from the later ones.",
    "(They will be sitting) on thrones woven with gold,",
    "reclining on them, facing each other.",
    "Immortal boys will rotate around them",
    "with bowls and jugs and a goblet of pure wine,",
    "from which they will neither suffer headache, nor will they be intoxicated,",
    "-and with fruits that they choose,",
    "and the flesh of birds that they desire.",
    "And (for them there will be) houris, having lovely big eyes,",
    "all (neat and clean) like a hidden pearl,",
    "as a reward for what they used to do.",
    "They will hear neither an absurd talk in it, nor something leading to sin,",
    "but (they will hear) the words of Salām , Salām (as greetings).",
    "And the People of the right? How (lucky) are the People of the Right!",
    "(They will be) amid lote-trees with no thorns,",
    "and the trees of TalH , (banana, or a fragrant tree) having layers one upon the other,",
    "and a shade, spread all over,",
    "and water, poured forth,",
    "and a lot of fruits,",
    "neither interrupted (in any season), nor prohibited,",
    "and mattresses of high quality.",
    "Surely We have made up those females in a special creation,",
    "and have made them virgins,",
    "amorous to their husbands, matching them in age,",
    "for the People of the Right,",
    "(comprising) many from the first generations,",
    "and many from the later ones.",
    "And the People of the Left? How (wretched) are the People of the Left!",
    "(They will be) in scorching wind and boiling water,",
    "and in a shade of black smoke,",
    "neither cool nor graceful.",
    "They were earlier in luxuries,",
    "and used to persist in major sins,",
    "and used to say, “Is it that when we die and become dust-is it that we will be raised again,",
    "and our ancient fathers as well?”",
    "Say, “All the earlier and the later ones",
    "will be gathered together for a fixed time of a specified Day.",
    "Then O you, the erring, the denying people,",
    "you will have to eat from the tree of zaqqūm,",
    "and to fill with it the bellies,",
    "then on top of it you will have to drink boiling water,",
    "and to drink like camels suffering from the disease of over-thirst.",
    "This will be their welcome entertainment on the Day of Requital.",
    "We have created you; then why do you not believe in it?",
    "So, tell Me about the semen you drop (in the wombs):",
    "Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator?",
    "We have appointed (the times of) death among you, and We cannot be frustrated",
    "from replacing you with others like you, and creating you (afresh) in that (form) which you do not know.",
    "And you certainly know the first creation; then why do you not take lesson?",
    "Well, tell Me about that (seed) which you sow:",
    "Is it you who grow it, or are We the One who grows?",
    "If We so will, We can certainly make it crumbled, and you will remain wondering,",
    "(and saying,) “We are laden with debt,",
    "rather we are totally deprived.”",
    "Again, tell Me about the water you drink:",
    "Is it you who have brought it down from the clouds, or are We the One who sends (it) down?",
    "If We so will, We can make it bitter in taste. So why do you not offer gratitude?",
    "Now tell Me about the fire you kindle:",
    "Is it you who have originated its tree, or are We the Originator?",
    "We have made it a reminder (of Our infinite power, and of the fire of Hell) and a benefit for travelers in deserts.",
    "So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the Magnificent.",
    "So, I swear by the setting places of the stars,",
    "-and indeed it is a great oath, if you are to appreciate-",
    "it is surely the Noble Qur’ān,",
    "(recorded already) in a protected book (i.e. the Preserved Tablet)",
    "that is not touched except by the purified ones (the angels).",
    "- a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Is it this discourse that you take lightly,",
    "and take your denial as your livelihood?",
    "So why (do you) not (intervene) when the soul (of a dying person) reaches the throat,",
    "and you are watching?",
    "And We are closer to him than you, but you do not perceive.",
    "So, if you are not going to be recompensed (in the Hereafter for your deeds), then why do you not",
    "bring the soul back, if you are truthful?",
    "So, in case he (the dying person) is from among those blessed with nearness,",
    "then (for him) there is comfort and fragrance and garden of bliss.",
    "And in case he is from among the People of the Right,",
    "then, (it will be said to him,) “Peace is for you, as you are one of the People of the Right.”",
    "But if he is one of the deniers, the astray,",
    "then (for him) there is entertainment from boiling water,",
    "and burning in the Hell.",
    "Indeed this is certainty in its true sense.",
    "So, proclaim purity of the name of your Lord, the Magnificent.",
    "All that is in the heavens and the earth proclaims Allah’s purity, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death, and He is Powerful to do any thing.",
    "He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing about every thing.",
    "He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He positioned Himself on the Throne. He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes out from it, and whatever descends from the sky, and whatever ascends thereto. He is with you wherever you are, and Allah is watchful of whatever you do.",
    "To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah all matters are returned.",
    "He makes the night enter into the day, and makes the day enter into the night, and He is All-Knowing about whatever lies in the hearts.",
    "Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend out of that (wealth) in which He has appointed you as deputies. So, for those of you who have believed and spent (in Allah’s way), there is a big reward.",
    "What is wrong with you that you do not believe in Allah, while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord, and He has taken your covenant, if you are to believe?",
    "He is the One who reveals clear verses to His servant, so that He brings you out from layers of darkness into the light. And to you, Allah is Very-Kind indeed, Very-Merciful.",
    "And what is wrong with you that you should not spend in the way of Allah, while to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? Those who spent before the Conquest (of Makkah) and fought are not at par (with others). Those are much greater in rank than those who spent later and fought, though Allah has promised the good (reward) for each. Allah is well aware of what you do.",
    "Who is there to advance a loan, a good loan, to Allah so that He multiplies it for him, and he may have a noble reward?",
    "On the Day when you will see the believing men and the believing women, their light proceeding in front of them and to their right hands, (it will be said to them,) “Good news for you today! Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever! That is the great achievement,",
    "- the Day when the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, so that we may have a share from your light.”It will be said (to them), “Go back to your rear, and search for light.” Then a wall will be placed between them, which will have a gate. In its inner side, there will be the divine mercy, while towards its outer side, there will be the divine punishment.",
    "They (the hypocrites) will call out to them (the believers), “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, (you were,) but you led your souls to a wrong way, and kept waiting (for an evil end to the Muslims), and remained in doubt, and were deluded by fancies, until Allah’s command came to pass, and you were deceived about Allah by the Big Deceiver (Iblīs).",
    "So, no ransom will be accepted from you today, nor from those who disbelieved (openly). Your abode is the Fire, and it is an evil end.”",
    "Has the time not yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and for the truth that has descended (through revelation)? They must not be like those to whom the Book was given before, but a long period passed on them (in which they did not repent), therefore their hearts became hard, and (thus) many of them are sinners.",
    "Know well that Allah revives the land after its death. We have made the signs clear for you, so that you may understand.",
    "Surely those men who give Sadaqah (alms) and those women who give Sadaqah and have advanced a good loan to Allah, for them it will be multiplied, and for them there is a noble reward.",
    "And those who believed in Allah and His messengers, - those are the Siddīqs (the most righteous after prophets) and the Shuhadā’ (martyrs) in the sight of your Lord. For them shall be their reward and their light. As for those who disbelieved and rejected Our verses, they are the inmates of Hell.",
    "Know well that the worldly life is but a play and an amusement, and a show of beauty, and exchange of boastful claims between you, and a competition of increase in riches and children. (All this is) like a rain, the growth of which attracts the farmers, then it withers, and you see it turning yellow, then it becomes straw. And in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment (for the disbelievers), and forgiveness from Allah and (Allah’s) pleasure (for the believers and the righteous). The worldly life is nothing but a material of delusion.",
    "Compete each other in proceeding towards forgiveness from your Lord and to Paradise the width of which is like the width of the sky and the earth. It has been prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah; He gives it to whomsoever He Wills and Allah is the Lord of the great bounty.",
    "No calamity befalls the earth or your own selves, but it is (pre-destined) in a Book before We bring it into being, -Indeed it is easy for Allah.",
    "- so that you may neither grieve on what has escaped you, nor over-exult on what He has given to you. And Allah does not love any self-admirer, over-proud,",
    "-those who are miserly and bid others to be miserly. And whoever turns away, then Allah is the All-Independent, the Ever-Praised.",
    "We have indeed sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and sent down with them the Book and the Balance, so that people may uphold equity. And We sent down iron in which there is strong power, and benefits for the people; and (We did it) so that Allah knows the one who helps Him and His messengers without seeing (Him). Surely Allah is Strong, Mighty.",
    "Indeed We sent NūH and Ibrāhīm, and kept the Book and prophet-hood (continuing) in their progeny. So, some of those (to whom they were sent) were on the right path, and many of them were sinners.",
    "Then We made Our messengers follow them one after the other, then We sent after them ‘Īsā, the son of Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary), and gave him the Injīl, and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, it was invented by them; We did not ordain it for them, but (they adopted it) to seek Allah’s pleasure, then could not observe it as was due. So We gave the believers from among them their reward. And many of them are sinners.",
    "O you who believe, fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger, and He will give you two shares (of reward) out of His mercy, and will make for you a light whereby you will walk, and will forgive you- And Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "- so that the People of the Book may know that they have no control over any thing from Allah’s bounty, and that bounty is in Allah’s hand; He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the Lord of the great bounty."
