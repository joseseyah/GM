    "Glorious is the One in whose hand is the Kingdom (of the whole universe), and He is powerful over every thing,",
    "the One who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in his deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving,",
    "who has created seven skies, one over the other. You will see nothing out of proportion in the creation of the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah). So, cast your eye again. Do you see any rifts?",
    "Then cast your eye again and again, and the eye will come back to you abased, in a state of weariness.",
    "And We have decorated the nearest sky with lamps, and have made them devices to stone the devils, and We have prepared for them the punishment of Hell.",
    "And for those who disbelieved in their Lord, there is the punishment of Jahannam , and it is an evil end.",
    "When they will be thrown in it, they will hear a terrible sound from it, and it will be boiling,",
    "seeming as if it will burst out of fury. Whenever a group is thrown into it, its keepers will say to them, “Had no warner come to you?”",
    "They will say, “Yes, a warner had come to us, but We had rejected, and said, ‘Allah has not revealed anything. You are only in great error.’”",
    "And they will say, “Had we been listening or understanding, we would not have been among the people of the Hell.”",
    "Thus they will confess their sin. So, away with the people of the Hell!",
    "Surely, for those who have awe of their Lord without seeing (Him), there is forgiveness and a big reward.",
    "Whether you keep your talk secret or make it aloud, He knows well what lies in the hearts.",
    "Is it (imaginable) that He who has created (them) will not have (such a) knowledge, while He is the Knower of the finest things, the All-Aware?",
    "He is the One who has made the earth subjugated for you, so walk on its shoulders, and eat out of His provision, and to Him is the Resurrection.",
    "Have you become fearless of Him who is in the sky if He makes you sink into the earth, and it starts trembling at once?",
    "Or, have you become fearless of Him who is in the sky if He looses a violent wind with stones against you? So, you will soon come to know how was My warning!",
    "And of course, those before them (also) rejected (the truth). So, how was My censure?",
    "Have they not looked to the birds above them spreading their wings, and (at times) they fold (them) in? No one holds them up except the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah). Surely He is watchful of every thing.",
    "Now, who is there to act as a force for you to help you, except the RaHmān ? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion.",
    "Or, who is there to give you sustenance, if He withholds His sustenance? Still, they persist in rebellion and aversion.",
    "Then, is the one who walks falling down (frequently) on his face more right or the one who walks properly on a straight path?",
    "Say, “He is the One who has originated you, and made for you ears and eyes and hearts. How little you pay gratitude!”",
    "Say, “He is the One who has scattered you on the earth, and to Him you will be assembled.”",
    "And they say, “When will this promise (of the Day of Judgment) be fulfilled, if you are true?”",
    "Say, “The knowledge (of that Day) is only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.",
    "Then, once they will see it approaching, the faces of the disbelievers will be turned awkward, and it will be said, “This is what you were calling for!”",
    "Say, “Tell me, if Allah destroys me and those who are with me (as you wish), or has mercy on us (as we wish), who can (in either case) save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”",
    "Say, “He is the RaHmān; we have believed in Him, and in Him we placed our trust. So, you will soon come to know who is in open error.”",
    "Say, “Tell me, Should your water vanish into the earth, who will bring you a flowing (stream of) water?",
    "Nūn , by the pen and what they write,",
    "with the grace of your Lord, you are not insane.",
    "And you will definitely have a reward that will never end.",
    "And you are surely on an excellent standard of character.",
    "So, you will see, and they will see",
    "which of you is demented.",
    "Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from his way, and He is well aware of those who are on the right path.",
    "So, do not obey those who reject (the true faith.)",
    "They wish that you become flexible (in your faith), so that they should become flexible (in their hostile attitude.)",
    "And do not obey any contemptible one who swears much,",
    "a slanderer who goes about with calumnies,",
    "one who prevents good, (and who is) transgressor, sinful,",
    "harsh, (and) after all that, notorious,",
    "(do not obey such a person merely) because he is a man of wealth and sons.",
    "When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These are) the tales of the ancient.”",
    "We will soon brand him on the snout.",
    "We have tested them as We had tested the Owners of the Garden, when they had sworn an oath that they would pluck its fruits on the next morning,",
    "and did not make any exception (by saying inshā’allāh ).",
    "Then, there whirled around it a whirl (of calamity) from your Lord, while they were asleep.",
    "Thus, on the next morning, it was like a harvested field.",
    "So, they called out each other as the morning broke,",
    "saying, “Set out early, if you are going to pluck (the fruits).”",
    "So they set out while they were whispering to each other,",
    "saying, “Let no poor man enter into it upon you today.”",
    "And in early hours they rushed quickly, while they were (assuming themselves) powerful (to pluck the fruits and prevent the poor.)",
    "But when they saw it (the place of the ruined garden), they said, “We have missed the way.”",
    "(Then, once they realized that the garden is the same, but it has been destroyed, they said,) “No, but we are deprived (of the fruits).”",
    "Said he who was the best among them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Why do you not pronounce tasbīH (Allah’s purity)?”",
    "They said, “We pronounce the purity of our Lord. No doubt, we were wrongdoers.”",
    "Then, (at the beginning,) they started reproaching one another;",
    "(and at last,) they said, “Woe to us! In fact, we (all) were outrageous.",
    "We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange something better than this. Truly we turn to Allah.”",
    "In this way the punishment comes. And, of course, the punishment of the Hereafter is even greater, if they but realize!",
    "Surely, for the God-fearing there are gardens of bliss.",
    "Otherwise, shall We make the obedient like the sinners?",
    "What has happened to you? How do you judge?",
    "Do you have a book in which you read",
    "that for you there is what you choose?",
    "Or do you have oaths sworn by Us, remaining effective up to the Day of Judgment, that you will get what you decide?",
    "Ask them which of them stands surety for that.",
    "Or do they have associate-gods (who have guaranteed safety for them)? Then, let them bring their associate-gods, if they are true.",
    "On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, and they will be called upon to prostrate themselves, they will not be able to.",
    "With their eyes downcast, they will be enveloped by ignominy. They used to be called upon to prostrate when they were healthy (but they did not.)",
    "So, leave Me alone with those who reject this discourse. We will draw them on little by little (towards Hell) from a way they do not know.",
    "And I give them respite. Indeed, My plan is firm.",
    "Is it that you ask them for a fee, due to which they are burdened with debt?",
    "Or do they have the (knowledge of the) Unseen, and they write it down?",
    "So, remain patient with your Lord’s judgment, and be not like the Man of the Fish, he cried out while he was in anguish.",
    "Had not a favour from His Lord come to his help, he would have been cast in the wilderness in a reproachable state.",
    "Then his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous.",
    "And indeed the disbelievers seem to trip you up with their glances when they hear the Reminder, and say, “He is a madman indeed.”",
    "And it is nothing else but a Reminder for all the worlds.",
    "The Imminent Happening!",
    "What is the Imminent Happening?",
    "And what can let you know what the Imminent happening is?",
    "Thamūd and ‘Ād had denied (the happening of) the Shocking Event (the Day of Judgment).",
    "As for Thamūd, they were destroyed by that (dreadful cry), which exceeded all limits.",
    "And as for ‘Ād, they were destroyed by a violent windstorm",
    "that He imposed on them for seven nights and eight consecutive days; so you could see them thrown on the ground, as if they were trunks of hollow palm-trees.",
    "Now, do you see any remnant of them?",
    "And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and those before him and the overthrown towns came up with evil,",
    "and they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an extremely severe seizure.",
    "When the water overflowed (in the Deluge of NūH), We let you (O mankind,) board the floating ship,",
    "so that We make it a reminder for you, and so that a preserving ear (that hears their story) may preserve it.",
    "Then, once the Trumpet will be blown for the first time,",
    "and the earth and the mountains will be lifted and crushed into pieces with a single blow,",
    "then on that Day the Happening will happen,",
    "and the sky will burst apart, while it will have become frail on that day.",
    "And the angels will be on its borders. And on that Day, the Throne of your Lord will be carried above them by eight (angels).",
    "On that day, you will be brought forward in a way that no secret of yours will remain secret.",
    "Now, as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say (to his colleagues), “Come here, read my book.",
    "I was sure that I would encounter my reckoning.”",
    "So he will be in a well-pleasing life",
    "in a lofty garden,",
    "the fruits of which will be close at hand.",
    "(It will be said to such people,) “Eat and drink with pleasure, as a reward for what you did in advance during past days.”",
    "As for him who will be given his book in his left hand, he will say, “ Oh, would that I had not been given my book,",
    "and I had never known what my account is!",
    "Oh, would that it (death) had been the end of the matter!",
    "My wealth has not been of any use to me.",
    "My power has gone from me for good.”",
    "(Then it will be said to angels,) “Seize him, then put a collar around his neck,",
    "and then, let him burn in the blazing fire.",
    "Thereafter, fasten him with a chain the measure of which is seventy hands.”",
    "Indeed, he did not believe in Allah, the Almighty,",
    "and did not persuade (others) to feed the needy.",
    "So, he has no friend here today,",
    "nor any food except that which comes out from wounds when washing,",
    "which is eaten by none but the sinners.",
    "I swear by what you see,",
    "and what you do not see,",
    "it is surely the speech of a noble Messenger, (that he conveys from Allah).",
    "and it is not the speech of a poet, (but) little you believe,",
    "nor is it the speech of a soothsayer, (but) little you heed to the advice.",
    "It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Had he (the prophet) forged some statements in Our name,",
    "We would have certainly seized him by the right hand,",
    "and then severed his life-artery,",
    "and none of you could have saved him from it.",
    "It is infact a Reminder for the God-fearing.",
    "And, of course, We know that among you there are deniers.",
    "And surely, it is a cause of remorse for the disbelievers.",
    "And it is surely an absolute truth.",
    "So, pronounce the purity of the name of your magnificent Lord.",
    "A demanding person has asked for the punishment that is going to befall",
    "the disbelievers; there is no one to avert it,",
    "(and it will come) from Allah, the Lord of the stairways,",
    "to whom ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the length of which is fifty thousand years.",
    "So, observe patience, a good patience.",
    "They see it far off,",
    "and We see it near.",
    "(This punishment will befall) on the Day when the sky will be like dregs of oil,",
    "and the mountains will be like dyed wool,",
    "and no friend will ask about any friend,",
    "(though) they will be made to see each other. A guilty person will desire that he may be able to ransom himself from the torment of that day even by his sons,",
    "and his wife and his brother,",
    "and his kindred that sheltered him,",
    "and all those on earth, then he may redeem himself.",
    "By no means! It is the flaming fire",
    "that will pull out the skin of the scalp.",
    "It will call him who had turned his back and fled away (from the truth)",
    "and accumulated (wealth) and hoarded (it).",
    "Indeed man is created weak in courage,",
    "very upset when touched by evil,",
    "and very niggard when visited by good (fortune),",
    "except the performers of Salāh,",
    "who are regular in their Salāh,",
    "and those in whose riches there is a specified right",
    "for the one who asks and the one who is deprived,",
    "and those who believe in the Day of Judgment as true,",
    "and those who are fearful of the torment of their Lord-",
    "-Indeed the torment of their Lord is not something to be fearless from.-",
    "and those who guard their private parts,",
    "except from their wives and those (slave-girls) owned by their hands,- because they are not to be blamed,",
    "but the one who seeks (sexual gratification) beyond that, then such people are the transgressors,-",
    "and those who are careful about their trusts and covenants,",
    "and those who are upright in their testimonies,",
    "and those who take due care of their Salāh .",
    "Those will be honoured in gardens (of Jannah ).",
    "So what has happened to those who disbelieve that they are rushing towards you",
    "from the right and from the left, in groups?",
    "Does every one of them aspire to be admitted to the garden of bliss?",
    "By no means! We have created them from what they know.",
    "So, I swear by the Lord of the points of sunrise and those of sunset, We are powerful",
    "to bring those better than them in their place, and We are not to be frustrated.",
    "So, leave them involved in pastime and play until they encounter their Day, which they are promised,",
    "the Day they will come out of the graves quickly, as if they were rushing toward idols,",
    "with their eyes downcast, enveloped by ignominy. That is the Day, which they were being promised.",
    "We sent NūH to his people (and said to him): “Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them.”",
    "He said, “O my people, I openly warn you",
    "that you must worship Allah, and fear Him, and obey me,",
    "and Allah will forgive you your sins, and will respite you to an appointed term. Indeed when Allah’s term comes, it is not deferred, if you only know!”",
    "He said, “My Lord, I have called my people night and day,",
    "but my call added only to their flight (from the truth).",
    "Whenever I called them, so that You might forgive them, they put their fingers into their ears, and wrapped their clothes around themselves, and grew obstinate, and waxed proud in extreme arrogance.",
    "Then I called them loudly,",
    "and then I spoke to them in public and spoke to them in private.",
    "So I said, ‘Pray to your Lord for your forgiveness,- Indeed He is Very-Forgiving, -",
    "and He will cause the heavens to rain upon you in abundance,",
    "and will help you with riches and sons, and will cause gardens to grow for you, and cause rivers to flow for you.",
    "What has happened to you that you do not appreciate the Majesty of Allah,",
    "while He has created you in different phases?",
    "Did you not see how Allah has created seven heavens one upon another,",
    "and has made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp?",
    "And Allah has caused you to grow well out of the earth,",
    "then He will send you back into it, and will bring you forth once again.",
    "And Allah has made the earth a spread for you,",
    "so that you may go about its broad ways.’”",
    "And said NūH, “My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed him whose wealth and children added nothing to him but loss,",
    "and they devised a mighty plot,",
    "and said (to their people), “Never forsake your gods, and never forsake Wadd, nor Suwā‘, nor Yaghūth and Ya‘ūq and Nasr.",
    "And they have led many astray. And (O my Lord,) let not the wrongdoers progress in anything but deviation from the right path.”",
    "Because of their sins they were drowned, and then admitted into the Fire. So they found no helpers for them besides Allah.",
    "And said NūH, “My Lord, do not leave on earth even a single inhabitant (surviving) out of the disbelievers.",
    "If You leave them (surviving), they will lead Your servants astray, and will beget none but a sinful disbeliever.",
    "My Lord, grant pardon to me, and to my parents, and to everyone who enters my home as a believer, and to all the believing men and believing women, and do not increase the wrongdoers but in ruin.",
    "Say, “It has been revealed to me that a group from Jinn has listened (to the Qur’ān), and said (to their people), ‘Indeed we have heard an amazing Recital (Qur’ān)",
    "that guides to the right way, so we have believed in it, and we will never associate a partner with our Lord.’",
    "and (then the Jinns started talking to each other) that exalted is the Glory of our Lord; He has taken neither a wife, nor a son,",
    "and that the fools among us used to attribute to Allah extremely absurd things,",
    "and that we thought that the humans and the Jinn would never tell a lie about Allah, (therefore, we had followed them in shirk under this impression),",
    "and that some guys from human beings used to seek refuge with some guys of the Jinn, and thus they increased them (the Jinns) in arrogance,",
    "and that they (humans) thought as you (O Jinns) thought that Allah will never resurrect anyone,",
    "and that we sought (to reach) the sky, but we found it filled with stern guards and flames,",
    "and that we used to sit at places therein to listen; but if one will (try to) listen now, he will find a flame in ambush for him,",
    "and that we do not know whether it is a bad end that is intended for those on earth, or their Lord has intended for them a right thing,",
    "and that some of us are (already) righteous, and some of us are otherwise, and we were on different ways;",
    "and that we have now believed that we can never frustrate Allah on the earth, nor can we baffle Him by escape,",
    "and that when we heard the Guiding Discourse, we believed in it; so if one believes in his Lord, he will have no fear of either any curtailment (in his reward) or any excess (in his punishment),",
    "and that some of us are Muslims, and some of us are unjust. Now, those who submitted to Islam have found out the right path,",
    "As for the unjust, they have become firewood for Hell.”",
    "“(And it is also revealed to me) that if they (the people of Makkah) had stood firm on the (right) way, We would have supplied water to them in abundance,",
    "so that We test them thereby; and if one turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will thrust him into a severe torment,",
    "and that masājid (mosques) belong to Allah; so, do not invoke anyone along with Allah,",
    "and that when Allah’s servant stood invoking Him, they almost rushed on him in crowds.”",
    "Say, “I invoke my Lord, and do not associate anyone with Him.”",
    "Say, “I possess no power to cause you any harm or bring you to a right way.”",
    "Say, “No one can ever save me from Allah, and I can never find a refuge save with Him.",
    "However, (I have been given power) of conveying (commands) from Allah, and His messages. The one who disobeys Allah and His Messenger, for him there is the fire of Hell, wherein such people will live forever.",
    "(The disbelievers will continue denying the truth and mock at it) until when they will see what they are promised, they will know whose supporters are weaker, and whose numbers are less.",
    "Say, “I do not know whether that which you are promised is near, or my Lord has appointed for it a distant term.",
    "(He is the) Knower of the Unseen. So He does not let anyone know the Unseen created by Him,",
    "except a messenger whom He chooses (to inform through revelation), and then He appoints (angels as) watching guards before him and behind him, (so that devils may not tamper with the divine revelation,)",
    "so that He knows that they (angels) have conveyed the messages of their Lord. And He has encompassed all that is with them, and has comprehensive knowledge of every thing by numbers.",
    "O you, wrapped up in clothes,",
    "stand at night (for prayer) except a little-",
    "-half of it, or make it a little less,",
    "or make it a little more; and recite the Qur’ān clearly with tartīl (in a distinct and measured tone).",
    "We are going to send down to you a weighty discourse.",
    "Truly, rising by night (for prayer of tahajjud) is the most effective way to subdue (one’s base self) and to make speech more upright.",
    "Surely, in daytime, you have a lengthy work to do.",
    "And remember the name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him with exclusive devotion.",
    "He is the Lord of the East and the West; there is no god but He; so take Him for (your) Guardian.",
    "And bear patiently what they (the opponents) say, and part with them in a beautiful manner.",
    "And leave Me alone (to deal) with the deniers, the people of luxury, and give them respite for a while.",
    "Surely with Us are fetters and flaming fire,",
    "and food that chokes, and a painful punishment",
    "on the Day when the earth and the mountains will quake, and the mountains will turn into a slipping heap of sand.",
    "(O people,) We have sent to you a messenger, as a witness over you, just as We sent a messenger to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).",
    "Then, Fir‘aun disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him with a severe seizure.",
    "So, if you disbelieve, how will you save yourself from a day that will turn the small boys into grey-headed old men,",
    "whereby the sky will burst apart. His promise has to be fulfilled.",
    "Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who so wishes, adopt a way to his Lord.",
    "Your Lord knows that you stand (in prayer) for nearly two thirds of the night, and (at times) for half of it, and (at times) for one third of it, and (so do) a group of those who are with you. And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you (O Muslims,) cannot do it in regular way; therefore He turned to you in mercy.Now, recite as much of the Qur’ān as is easy (for you). He knows that some of you may be sick, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and yet others fighting in Allah’s way. Therefore, recite as much of it as is easy. And establish Salāh, and pay Zakāh, and advance to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send ahead for your own-selves, you will find it with Allah much better in condition, and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "O you, enveloped in a mantle,",
    "stand up and warn,",
    "and pronounce the greatness of your Lord,",
    "and purify your clothes,",
    "and keep away from filth,",
    "and do not do a favour (to anyone merely) to seek more (in return).",
    "And for the sake of your Lord, observe patience.",
    "For when the trumpet will be blown,",
    "that day will be a difficult day,",
    "not easy for the disbelievers.",
    "Leave me alone (to deal) with the one whom I created lonely,",
    "and gave him extensive wealth,",
    "and sons present before (his) eyes,",
    "and extended (power and honour) to him pretty well.",
    "Still, he aspires that I should give him more.",
    "Never! He is inimical towards Our verses.",
    "I will force him to climb the mountain Sa‘ūd.",
    "He pondered and surmised.",
    "Death onto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!",
    "Again, death unto him! How (bad) is the surmise he put forward!",
    "Then he looked (to those around him,)",
    "then he frowned and scowled,",
    "then turned his back, and waxed proud,",
    "then said, “This is nothing but traditional magic;",
    "this is nothing but saying of a mortal.”",
    "I will put him into Saqar (Hell).",
    "And what can let you know what Saqar is?",
    "It neither spares (anything inside it from burning) nor leaves (any disbeliever outside).",
    "It will disfigure the skins.",
    "Appointed on it are nineteen (wardens).",
    "And We did not make wardens of the Fire but (from) angels, and did not fix their number but as a test for those who disbelieve, so that those who are given the Book may come to believe, and those who believe may improve in belief, and so that those who are given the Book and those who believe may not doubt (its correctness), and so that those having malady in their hearts and the disbelievers say, “What has Allah meant by this strange statement?” Thus Allah lets go astray whomever He wills, and leads to the right path whomever He wills. And no one knows the hosts of your Lord but He. And this is nothing else but a reminder for mankind.",
    "Truly, I swear by the moon,",
    "and by the night when it goes back,",
    "and by the morning when it becomes bright,",
    "it (Saqar : Hell) is one of the greatest things",
    "as a warning to the mankind,",
    "to the one from among you who wishes to come forward (towards good deeds) or to go back (from them).",
    "Everyone will be detained (in the Hell) because of what he did,",
    "except the People of the Right, (i.e. those who will be given their Book of Deeds in their right hands)",
    "who will be in gardens, asking",
    "about the guilty persons,",
    "“What has brought you to Saqar? (Hell)”",
    "They will say, “We were not among those who offered Salāh , (obligatory prayer)",
    "and we did not give food to the needy,",
    "and we indulged (in mocking at the truth) along with those who indulged,",
    "and we used to deny the Day of Requital,",
    "until when we were overtaken by that which is certain.”",
    "Then intercession of intercessors will not benefit them.",
    "So what has happened to them that they are turning away from the Reminder,",
    "as if they were wild donkeys,",
    "fleeing from a lion?",
    "Rather, every one of them wishes that he should be given unrolled (divine) scriptures.",
    "Never! But they do not fear the Hereafter.",
    "Never! Indeed, this is a Reminder.",
    "So, whoever so wishes may take advice from it.",
    "And they will not take advice unless Allah so wills. He is worthy to be feared, and worthy to forgive.",
    "I swear by the Day of Resurrection,",
    "and I swear by the self-reproaching conscience, (that Resurrection is a reality.)",
    "Does man think that We will never reassemble his bones?",
    "Why (can We) not (do so), while We are able to reset (even) his fingertips perfectly?",
    "But man wishes to go on violating Allah’s injunctions (even in future) ahead of him.",
    "He asks, “When will be this Day of Resurrection?”",
    "So, when the eyes will be dazzled,",
    "and the moon will lose its light,",
    "and the sun and the moon will be joined together,",
    "on that day man will say, “Where to escape?”",
    "Never! There will be no refuge at all.",
    "On that day, towards your Lord will be the destination (of everyone.)",
    "Man will be informed of what he sent ahead and what he left behind.",
    "Rather, man will be a witness against himself,",
    "even though he may offer his excuses.",
    "(O Prophet,) do not move your tongue (during revelation) for (reciting) it (the Qur’ān) to receive it in hurry.",
    "It is surely undertaken by Us to store it (in your heart), and to let it be recited (by you after revelation is completed).",
    "Therefore, when it is recited by Us (through the angel), follow its recitation (by concentration of your heart).",
    "Then, it is undertaken by Us to explain it.",
    "Never, (your denial of Resurrection is never based on any sound reason!) Instead, you love that which is immediate,",
    "and neglect the Hereafter.",
    "Many faces, that day, will be glowing,",
    "looking towards their Lord,",
    "and many faces, that day, will be gloomy,",
    "realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them.",
    "Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles,",
    "and it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)”",
    "and he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,)",
    "and one shank is intertwined with the other shank,",
    "then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven.",
    "So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed,",
    "but rejected the truth and turned away (from it),",
    "then he went to his home, puffed up with pride.",
    "(It will be said to such a man,) Woe to you, then woe to you!",
    "Again, woe to you, then woe to you!",
    "Does man presume that he will be left unchecked?",
    "Was he not an ejaculated drop of semen?",
    "Then he became a clot of blood, then He created (him) and made (him) perfect,",
    "and made from him two kinds, male and female.",
    "Has He no power to give life to the dead?",
    "There has come upon man a period of time in which he was nothing worth mentioning.",
    "We have created man from a mixed sperm-drop to put him to a test; then We made him able to hear, able to see.",
    "We have shown him the way to be either grateful or ungrateful.",
    "We have prepared, for the disbelievers, shackles and iron-collars and a blazing Fire.",
    "Indeed, the righteous will have a drink from a goblet, blended with (a drink from) Camphor",
    "that will be a spring from which Allah’s servants will drink, making it flow (wherever they wish) profusely.",
    "They (are the ones who) fulfill their vows, and fear a day whose evil (events) will spread far and wide,",
    "and they give food, out of their love for Him (Allah), to the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,",
    "(saying to them,) “We feed you only for the sake of Allah; we have no intention of (receiving) either a return from you or thanks.",
    "In fact, we are fearful of a day, from the side of our Lord, that will be frowning, extremely malignant.”",
    "So Allah will save them from the evil of that day, and will grant them bloom and delight,",
    "and will give them, in return for their patience, Paradise and (garments of) silk,",
    "wherein they will be reclining on couches, feeling neither heat of the sun nor intense cold.",
    "And shades of gardens will be hanging low on them, and their fruits will be placed totally under their command.",
    "Circulated among them will be vessels of silver, and cups that will be (as transparent as) crystals,",
    "-crystals (as shining as if made) of silver, measured by those (who filled them) with due measure.",
    "And they will be served with goblet of a drink blended with ginger,",
    "(acquired from) a spring therein called Salsabīl.",
    "And circling around them will be serving boys, blessed with eternal youth; when you would see them, you would take them as scattered pearls.",
    "When you will look around there, you will see the Bliss and a magnificent realm.",
    "Upon them will be garments of green sundus (a kind of fine silk), and of istabraq (a kind of thick silk), and they will be adorned by bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give them a pure beverage to drink:",
    "“This is a reward for you, and your effort has been appreciated.”",
    "Indeed we have revealed to you the Qur’ān through a gradual process.",
    "So, be steadfast patiently in (obeying) your Lord’s command, and do not obey any one of them who is sinner or ungrateful.",
    "And pronounce the name of Allah morning and evening.",
    "And in some parts of night prostrate yourself before Him, and pronounce His purity for long times at night.",
    "In fact these people love that which is immediate, and neglect a Heavy Day ahead of them.",
    "We have created them and have made their joints strong. And whenever We will, We would replace them with others like them, a total replacement.",
    "Indeed, this is a reminder; so let anyone who so wishes, adopt a way to his Lord.",
    "And you will not so wish unless Allah so wills. Indeed Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "He admits whomsoever He wills to His mercy. As for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment.",
    "(I swear) by those (winds) that are sent one after the other,",
    "and by those that blow violently,",
    "and by those that spread (clouds) all over,",
    "and by those (angels) who differentiate (between right and wrong) distinctly,",
    "then bring down the advice,",
    "leaving no excuse (for the disbelievers) or giving warnings,",
    "that which you are promised is sure to happen.",
    "So, when the stars will be extinguished,",
    "and when the sky will be split,",
    "and when the mountains will be blown away as dust,",
    "and when the messengers will be assembled at the appointed time, (then all matters will be decided.)",
    "(Do you know) for which day has all this been delayed?",
    "For the Day of Decision!",
    "And what may let you know what the Day of Decision is?",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "Did We not destroy the earlier people?",
    "Then We will cause the later ones to follow them.",
    "Thus We deal with the guilty people.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "Did We not create you from a worthless fluid?",
    "Then We put it in a firm place of rest",
    "for a known period.",
    "Thus We did (all this with perfect) measure; so We are the best to measure.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "Did We not make the earth a container that collects",
    "the living and the dead?",
    "And We placed towering mountains therein, and provided you with sweet water to drink.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "(It will be said to them on that day,) “Push on to what you used to deny.",
    "Push on to a canopy (of Hell’s smoke) having three branches,",
    "that neither has a comfortable shade, nor is it of any use against the scorching heat.",
    "It emits sparks (as huge) as castles,",
    "as if they were yellowish camels.”",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "This is the day when they will not speak,",
    "nor will they be allowed to offer excuses.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "(It will be said to them,) “This is the Day of Decision. We have assembled you and the earlier ones together.",
    "Now, if you have a trick, use the trick against Me.”",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "Of course, the God-fearing will be amid shades and streams,",
    "and fruits of their desire.",
    "It will be said to them, “Eat and drink with pleasure because of what you used to do.”",
    "This is how We reward those who do good deeds.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "“(O disbelievers,) eat and drink for a while! You are guilty ones.”",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "And when it is said to them, “Bow down (i.e. submit to Allah’s commands)”, they do not bow down.",
    "Woe that Day to the deniers!",
    "Now, in which discourse, after this, will they believe?"
