    "And those who expect not a Meeting with Us (i.e. those who deny the Day of Resurrection and the life of the Hereafter) said: \"Why are not the angels sent down to us, or why do we not see our Lord?\" Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and are scornful with great pride.",
    "On the Day they will see the angels - no glad tidings will there be for the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) that day. And they (angels) will say: \"All kinds of glad tidings are forbidden to you,\" [none will be allowed to enter Paradise except the one who said: Lâ ilâha illallâh, \"(none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and acted practically on its legal orders and obligations. See the footnote of V.:)].",
    "And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.",
    "The dwellers of Paradise (i.e. those who deserved it through their Islamic Monotheistic Faith and their deeds of righteousness) will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.",
    "And (remember) the Day when the heaven shall be rent asunder with clouds, and the angels will be sent down, with a grand descending.",
    "The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Gracious (Allâh), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers (those who disbelieve in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism).",
    "And (remember) the Day when the Zâlim (wrong-doer, oppressor, polytheist) will bite at his hands, he will say: \"Oh! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم).",
    "\"Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a Khalîl (an intimate friend)!",
    "\"He indeed led me astray from the Reminder (this Qur’ân) after it had come to me. And Shaitân (Satan) is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need.\" [Tafsir Al-Qurtubi]",
    "And the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur’ân (neither listened to it, nor acted on its laws and teachings).",
    "Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the Mujrimûn (disbelievers, polytheists, criminals). But Sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.",
    "And those who disbelieve say: \"Why is not the Qur’ân revealed to him all at once?\" Thus (it is sent down in parts), that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages. (It was revealed to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in  years.).",
    "And no example or similitude do they bring (to oppose or to find fault in you or in this Qur’ân), but We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude or example), and the better explanation thereof.",
    "Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces, such will be in an evil state, and most astray from the (Straight) Path.",
    "And indeed We gave Mûsâ (Moses) the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)], and placed his brother Hârûn (Aaron) with him as a helper;",
    "And We said: \"Go you both to the people who have denied Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).\" Then We destroyed them with utter destruction.",
    "And Nûh’s (Noah) people, when they denied the Messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a sign for mankind. And We have prepared a painful torment for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).",
    "And (also) ‘Âd and Thamûd, and the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, and many generations in between.",
    "And for each (of them) We put forward examples (as proofs and lessons), and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin (because of their disbelief and evil deeds).",
    "And indeed they have passed by the town [of Prophet Lût (Lot)] on which was rained the evil rain. Did they (disbelievers) not then see it (with their own eyes)? Nay! But they used not to expect any resurrection.",
    "And when they see you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), they treat you only in mockery (saying): \"Is this the one whom Allâh has sent as a Messenger?",
    "\"He would have nearly misled us from our âlihah (gods), had it not been that we were patient and constant in their worship!\" And they will know when they see the torment, who it is that is most astray from the (Right) Path!",
    "Have you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) seen him who has taken as his ilâh (god) his own vain desire? Would you then be a Wakîl (a disposer of his affairs or a watcher) over him?",
    "Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle - nay, they are even farther astray from the Path (i.e. even worse than cattle).",
    "Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow. If He willed, He could have made it still - But We have made the sun its guide (i.e. after the sunrise, the shadow shrinks and vanishes at midnoon and then again appears in the afternoon with the decline of the sun, and had there been no sunlight, there would have been no shadow).",
    "Then We withdraw it to Us a gradual concealed withdrawal.",
    "And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you, and the sleep (as) a repose, and makes the day Nushûr (i.e. getting up and going about here and there for daily work, after one’s sleep at night, or like resurrection after one’s death).",
    "And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain); and We send down pure water from the sky.",
    "That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created.",
    "And indeed We have distributed it (rain or water) amongst them in order that they may remember (the Grace of Allâh,) but most men (refuse to accept the Truth or Faith and) accept nothing but disbelief or ingratitude.",
    "And had We willed, We would have raised a warner in every town.",
    "So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them (by preaching) with the utmost endeavour with it (the Qur’ân).",
    "And it is He Who has let free the two seas (kinds of water): this is palatable and sweet, and that is salt and bitter; and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.",
    "And it is He Who has created man from water, and has appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage. And your Lord is Ever All-Powerful to do what He wills.",
    "And they (disbelievers, polytheists) worship besides Allâh that which can neither profit them nor harm them; and the disbeliever is ever a helper (of the Satan) against his Lord.",
    "And We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) only as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.",
    "Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this (that which I have brought from my Lord and its preaching), save that whosoever wills may take a Path to his Lord.",
    "And put your trust (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in the Ever Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His slaves,",
    "Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days. Then He (Istawâ ) rose over the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). The Most Gracious (Allâh)! Ask Him (O Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم , concerning His Qualities: His rising over His Throne, His creations, etc.), as He is Al-Khabîr (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allâh).",
    "And when it is said to them: \"Prostrate yourselves to the Most Gracious (Allâh)! they say: \"And what is the Most Gracious? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) command us?\" And it increases in them only aversion.",
    "Blessed be He Who has placed in the heaven big stars, and has placed therein a great lamp (sun), and a moon giving light.",
    "And He it is Who has put the night and the day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.",
    "And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allâh) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness.",
    "And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrate and standing.",
    "And those who say: \"Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.\"",
    "Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in.",
    "And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes).",
    "And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allâh, nor kill such person as Allâh has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse - and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.",
    "The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;",
    "Except those who repent and believe (in Islâmic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allâh will change their sins into good deeds, and Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allâh with true repentance.",
    "And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity.",
    "And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.",
    "And those who say: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqûn(the pious. See V.:).\"",
    "Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect.",
    "Abiding therein - excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to the disbelievers): \"My Lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to Him. But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable, permanent punishment).\"",
    "Tâ-Sîn-Mîm.",
    "These are the Verses of the manifest Book [(this Qur’ân), which was promised by Allâh in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), makes things clear].",
    "It may be that you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) are going to kill yourself with grief, that they do not become believers [in your Risalah (Messengership) i.e. in your Message of Islâmic Monotheism].",
    "If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.",
    "And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious (Allâh), but they turn away therefrom.",
    "So they have indeed denied (the truth - this Qur’ân), then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.",
    "Do they not observe the earth - how much of every good kind We cause to grow therein?",
    "Verily, in this is an Ayâh (proof or sign), yet most of them (polytheists, pagans who do not believe in Resurrection) are not believers.",
    "And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.",
    "And (remember) when your Lord called Mûsâ (Moses) (saying): \"Go to the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) -",
    "\"The people of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh): Will they not fear Allâh and become righteous?\"",
    "He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will belie me,",
    "\"And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Hârûn (Aaron) (to come along with me).",
    "\"And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.\"",
    "(Allâh) said: \"Nay! Go you both with Our Signs. Verily We shall be with you, listening.",
    "\"And go both of you to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), and say: ‘We are the Messengers of the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists),",
    "\"So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.’ \"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said [to Mûsâ (Moses)]: \"Did we not bring you up among us as a child? And you did dwell many years of your life with us.",
    "\"And you did your deed, which you did (i.e. the crime of killing a man) while you were one of the ingrates.\"",
    "Mûsâ (Moses) said: \"I did it then, when I was ignorant (as regards my Lord and His Message).",
    "\"So I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm (i.e. religious knowledge, right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood), and made me one of the Messengers.",
    "\"And this is the past favour with which you reproach me: that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.\"",
    "Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: \"And what is the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?\"",
    "[Mûsâ (Moses)] said: \"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty.\"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said to those around: \"Do you not hear (what he says)?\"",
    "[Mûsâ (Moses)] said: \"Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!\"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said: \"Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!\"",
    "[Mûsâ (Moses)] said: \"Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!\"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said: \"If you choose an ilâh (god) other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.\"",
    "[Mûsâ (Moses)] said: \"Even if I bring you something manifest (and convincing)?\"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said: \"Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!\"",
    "So [Mûsâ (Moses)] threw his stick, and behold, it was a serpent, manifest.",
    "And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said to the chiefs around him: \"Verily! This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer.",
    "\"He wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery: what is it then that you command?\"",
    "They said: \"Put him off and his brother (for a while), and send callers to the cities;",
    "\"To bring up to you every well-versed sorcerer.\"",
    "So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time on a day appointed.",
    "And it was said to the people: \"Are you (too) going to assemble?",
    "\"That we may follow the sorcerers [who were on Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) religion of disbelief] if they are the winners.\"",
    "So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh): \"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners?\"",
    "He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near (to myself).\"",
    "Mûsâ (Moses) said to them: \"Throw what you are going to throw!\"",
    "So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh), it is we who will certainly win!\"",
    "Then Mûsâ (Moses) threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!",
    "And the sorcerers fell down prostrate.",

    "\"The Lord of Mûsâ (Moses) and Hârûn (Aaron).\"",
    "[Fir‘aun (Pharaoh)] said: \"You have believed in him before I give you leave. Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic! So verily, you shall come to know. Verily, I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.\"",
    "They said: \"No harm! Surely, to our Lord (Allâh) we are to return.",
    "\"Verily we really hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first of the believers [in Mûsâ (Moses) and in the Monotheism which he has brought from Allâh].\"",
    "And We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses), saying: \"Depart by night with My slaves, verily you will be pursued.\"",

    "Then We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses) (saying): \"Strike the sea with your stick.\" And it parted, and each separate part (of that sea water) became like huge mountain.",
    "Then We brought near the others [Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) party] to that place.",
    "And We saved Mûsâ (Moses) and all those with him.",

    "Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars (like ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm رضي الله عنه who embraced Islâm) of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)?",
    "And if We had revealed it (this Qur’ân) unto any of the non-Arabs,",
    "And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.",
    "Thus have We caused it (the denial of the Qur’ân) to enter the hearts of the Mûjrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners).",
    "They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment.",

    "And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.",
    "Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\"",

    "(Remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) said to his household: \"Verily I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand, that you may warm yourselves.\"",
    "But when he came to it, he was called: \"Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it! And glorified be Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).",
    "\"O Mûsâ (Moses)! Verily it is I, Allâh, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",
    "\"And throw down your stick!\" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and did not look back. (It was said:) \"O Mûsâ (Moses)! Fear not: verily the Messengers fear not in front of Me.",
    "\"Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "\"And put your hand into your bosom, it will come forth white without hurt. (These are) among the nine signs (you will take) to Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people. Verily they are a people who are Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).",
    "But when Our Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came to them, clear to see, they said: \"This is a manifest magic.\"",
    "And they belied them (those Ayât) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their ownselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayât ) are from Allâh, and Mûsâ (Moses) is the Messenger of Allâh in truth, but they disliked to obey Mûsâ (Moses), and hated to believe in his Message of Monotheism]. So see what was the end of the Mufsidûn (disbelievers, disobedient to Allâh, evil-doers and liars.).",
    "And indeed We gave knowledge to Dâwûd (David) and Sulaimân (Solomon), and they both said: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, Who has preferred us above many of His believing slaves!\"",
    "And Sulaimân (Solomon) inherited (the knowledge of) Dâwûd (David). He said: \"O mankind! We have been taught the language of birds, and on us have been bestowed all things. This, verily, is an evident grace (from Allâh).\"",
    "And there were gathered before Sulaimân (Solomon) his hosts of jinn and men, and birds, and they all were set in battle order (marching forward).",
    "Till, when they came to the valley of the ants, one of the ants said: \"O ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulaimân (Solomon) and his hosts should crush you, while they perceive not.\"",
    "So he [Sulaimân (Solomon)] smiled, amused at her speech and said: \"My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favours which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You, and admit me by Your Mercy among Your righteous slaves.\"",
    "He inspected the birds, and said: \"What is the matter that I see not the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?",
    "\"I will surely punish him with a severe torment, or slaughter him, unless he brings me a clear reason.\"",
    "But the hoopoe stayed not long: he (came up and) said: \"I have grasped (the knowledge of a thing) which you have not grasped and I have come to you from Saba’ (Sheba) with true news.",
    "\"I found a woman ruling over them: she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne.",
    "\"I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allâh, and Shaitân (Satan) has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allâh’s) Way: so they have no guidance.\"",
    "[As Shaitân (Satan) has barred them from Allâh’s Way] so they do not worship (prostrate themselves before) Allâh, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. [Tafsir At-Tabarî]",
    "Allâh, Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!",
    "[Sulaimân (Solomon)] said: \"We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are (one) of the liars.",
    "\"Go you with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them, then draw back from them, and see what (answer) they return.\"",
    "She said: \"O chiefs! Verily! Here is delivered to me a noble letter,",
    "\"Verily it is from Sulaimân (Solomon), and verily, it (reads): In the Name of Allâh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful:",
    "\"Be you not exalted against me, but come to me as Muslims (true believers who submit to Allâh with full submission).’ \"",
    "She said: \"O chiefs! Advise me in (this) case of mine. I decide no case till you are present with me (and give me your opinions).\"",
    "They said: \"We have great strength, and great ability for war, but it is for you to command: so think over what you will command.\"",
    "She said: \"Verily kings, when they enter a town (country), they despoil it and make the most honourable amongst its people the lowest. And thus they do.",
    "\"But verily! I am going to send him a present, and see with what (answer) the messengers return.\"",
    "So when (the messengers with the present) came to Sulaimân (Solomon), he said: \"Will you help me in wealth? What Allâh has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift!\"",
    "[Then Sulaimân (Solomon) said to the chief of her messengers who brought the present]: \"Go back to them. We verily shall come to them with hosts that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased.\"",
    "He said: \"O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience?\"",
    "A ‘Ifrît (strong one) from the jinn said: \"I will bring it to you before you rise from your place (council). And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work.\"",
    "One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: \"I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!\" Then when he [Sulaimân (Solomon)] saw it placed before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his ownself; and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself). Certainly my Lord is Rich (Free of all needs), Bountiful.\"",
    "He said: \"Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided (to recognise her throne), or she will be one of those not guided.\"",
    "So when she came, it was said (to her): \"Is your throne like this?\" She said: \"(It is) as though it were the very same.\" And [Sulaimân (Solomon) said]: \"Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we were submitted to Allâh (in Islâm as Muslims before her).\"",
    "And that which she used to worship besides Allâh has prevented her (from Islâm), for she was of a disbelieving people.",
    "It was said to her: \"Enter As-Sarh\" (a glass surface with water underneath it or a palace): but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs. (Sulaimân (Solomon)) said: \"Verily, it is a Sarh (a glass surface with water underneath it or a palace).\" She said: \"My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit [in Islâm, together with Sulaimân (Solomon)] to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Âlamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).\"",
    "And indeed We sent to Thamûd their brother Sâlih, saying: \"Worship Allâh (Alone and none else). Then look! They became two parties (believers and disbelievers) quarreling with each other.\"",
    "He said: \"O my people! Why do you seek to hasten the evil (torment) before the good (Allâh’s Mercy)? Why seek you not the Forgiveness of Allâh, that you may receive mercy?\"",
    "They said: \"We augur ill omen from you and those with you.\" He said: \"Your ill omen is with Allâh; nay, but you are a people that are being tested.\"",
    "And there were in the city nine men (from the sons of their chiefs), who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.",
    "They said: \"Swear one to another by Allâh that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household, and thereafter we will surely say to his near relatives: ‘We witnessed not the destruction of his household, and verily we are telling the truth.’\"",
    "So they plotted a plot, and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not.",
    "Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily! We destroyed them and their nation, all together.",
    "These are their houses in utter ruin, for they did wrong. Verily, in this is indeed an Ayâh (a lesson or a sign) for people who know.",
    "And We saved those who believed, and used to fear Allâh, and keep their duty to Him.",
    "And (remember) Lût (Lot)! When he said to his people. Do you commit Al-Fâhishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen)?\"",
    "\"Do you practise your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.\"",
    "There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: \"Drive out the family of Lût (Lot) from your city Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!\"",
    "So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind.",
    "And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned.",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): \"Praise and thanks be to Allâh, and peace be on His slaves whom He has chosen (for His Message)! Is Allâh better, or (all) that you ascribe as partners (to Him)?\" (Of course, Allâh is Better)."
