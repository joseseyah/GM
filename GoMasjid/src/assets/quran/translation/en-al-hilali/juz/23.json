    "And he said: \"Verily, I am sick (with plague). [He did this trick to remain in their temple of idols to destroy them and not to accompany them to the pagan feast)].\"",
    "So they turned away from him, and departed (for fear of the disease).",
    "Then he turned to their âlihah (gods) and said: \"Will you not eat (of the offering before you)?",

    "And We saved them and their people from the great distress,",
    "And helped them, so that they became the victors;",
    "And We gave them the clear Scripture;",

And, verily, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and they are few.\" And Dâwûd (David) guessed that We have tried him and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allâh) in repentance.",
    "So We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of (final) return (Paradise).",
    "O Dâwûd (David)! Verily! We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your desire - for it will mislead you from the Path of Allâh. Verily, those who wander astray from the Path of Allâh (shall) have a severe torment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.",
    "And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Islâmic Monotheism) from the Fire!",
    "Shall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidûn (those who associate partners in worship with Allâh and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.:) as the Fujjâr (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?",
    "(This is) a Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.",
    "And to Dâwûd (David) We gave Sulaimân (Solomon). How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!",
    "When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of the highest breed [for Jihâd (holy fighting in Allâh’s Cause)].",
    "He said: \"I did love the good (these horses) instead of remembering my Lord (in my ‘Asr prayer)\" till the time was over, and (the sun) had hidden in the veil (of night).",
    "Then he said \"Bring them (horses) back to me.\" Then he began to pass his hand over their legs and their necks (till the end of the display).",
    "And indeed, We did try Sulaimân (Solomon) and We placed on his throne Jasad (a devil, so he lost his kingdom for a while) and he did return (to Allâh with obedience and in repentance, and to his throne and kingdom by the Grace of Allâh).",
    "He said: \"My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me: Verily, You are the Bestower.\"",

    "(Allâh said to him): \"Strike the ground with your foot: This is (a spring of) water to wash in, cool and a (refreshing) drink.\"",

    "\"And take in your hand a bundle of thin grass and strike therewith (your wife), and break not your oath. Truly! We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!",

    "Verily, We did choose them by granting them (a good thing, - i.e.) the remembrance of the Home [in the Hereafter and they used to make the people remember it, and also they used to invite the people to obey Allâh and to do good deeds for the Hereafter].",
    "And they are with Us, verily, of the chosen and the best!",

    "This is a Reminder. And verily, for the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.:) is a good final return (Paradise),",
    "‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), whose doors will be opened for them.",
    "Therein they will recline; therein they will call for fruits in abundance and drinks;",

    "This is so! Then let them taste it - a boiling fluid and dirty wound discharges.",
    "And other (torments) of similar kind - all together!",
    "This is a troop entering with you (in Hell), no welcome for them! Verily, they shall burn in the Fire!",
    "(The followers of the misleaders will say): \"Nay, you (too)! No welcome for you! It is you (misleaders) who brought this upon us (because you misled us in the world), so evil is this place to stay in!\"",
    "They will say: \"Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, add to him a double torment in the Fire!\"",
    "And they will say: \"What is the matter with us that we see not men whom we used to count among the bad ones?\"",
    "Did we take them as an object of mockery, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?\"",
    "Verily, that is the very truth - the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!",

    "So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them:",
    "Except Iblîs (Satan): he was proud and was one of the disbelievers.",
    "(Allâh) said: \"O Iblîs (Satan)! What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands. Are you too proud (to fall prostrate to Adam) or are you one of the high exalted?\"",
    "[Iblîs (Satan)] said: \"I am better than he. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.\"",
    "(Allâh) said: \"Then get out from here; for verily you are outcast.",

    "\"Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).\"",
    "(Allâh) said: \"The Truth is - and the Truth I say -",
    "That I will fill Hell with you [Iblîs (Satan)] and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together.\"",

    "The revelation of this Book (the Qur’ân) is from Allâh, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",

    "Surely the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allâh only. And those who take Auliyâ’ (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): \"We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.\" Verily Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.",
    "Had Allâh willed to take a son (or offspring), He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! (He is above such things). He is Allâh, the One, the Irresistible.",
    "He has created the heavens and the earth with truth. He makes the night to go in the day and makes the day to go in the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon. Each running (on a fixed course) for an appointed term. Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.",
    "He created you (all) from a single person (Adam); then made from him his wife [Hawwâ’ (Eve)]. And He has sent down for you of cattle eight pairs (of the sheep, two, male and female; of the goats, two, male and female; of the oxen, two, male and female; and of the camels, two, male and female). He creates you in the wombs of your mothers: creation after creation in three veils of darkness. Such is Allâh your Lord. His is the kingdom. Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). How then are you turned away?",
    "If you disbelieve, then verily, Allâh is not in need of you; He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you what you used to do. Verily, He is the All-Knower of that which is in (men’s) breasts.",
    "And when some hurt touches man, he cries to his Lord (Allâh Alone), turning to Him in repentance. But when He bestows a favour upon him from Himself, he forgets that for which he cried for before, and he sets up rivals to Allâh, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: \"Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while: surely you are (one) of the dwellers of the Fire!\"",
    "Is one who is obedient to Allâh, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: \"Are those who know equal to those who know not?\" It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allâh’s Signs and Verses).",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): \"O My slaves who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), be afraid of your Lord (Allâh) and keep your duty to Him. Good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and Allâh’s earth is spacious (so if you cannot worship Allâh at a place, then go to another)! Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.\"",

    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): \"Allâh Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only (and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship.)\"",
    "So worship what you like besides Him. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): \"The losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, that will be a manifest loss!\"",
    "They shall have coverings of Fire, above them and covering (of Fire) beneath them. With this Allâh does frighten His slaves: \"O My slaves, therefore fear Me!\"",
    "Those who avoid At-Tâghût  (false deities) by not worshipping them and turn to Allâh (in repentance), for them are glad tidings; so announce the good news to My slaves -",
    "Those who listen to the Word [good advice Lâ ilâha illallâh - (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) and Islâmic Monotheism] and follow the best thereof (i.e. worship Allâh Alone, repent to Him and avoid Tâghût) those are (the ones) whom Allâh has guided and those are men of understanding.",
    "Is, then one against whom the Word of punishment is justified (equal to the one who avoids evil)? Will you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) rescue him who is in the Fire?",
    "But those who fear their Lord (Allâh) and keep their duty to Him, for them are built lofty rooms, one above another under which rivers flow (i.e. Paradise). (This is) the Promise of Allâh: and Allâh does not fail in (His) Promise.",
    "See you not that Allâh sends down water (rain) from the sky, and causes it to penetrate the earth, (and then makes it to spring up) as water-springs, and afterward thereby produces crops of different colours, and afterward they wither and you see them turn yellow; then He makes them dry and broken pieces. Verily, in this is a Reminder for men of understanding.",
    "Is he whose breast Allâh has opened to Islâm, so that he is in light from His Lord (as he who is a non-Muslim)? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allâh! They are in plain error!",
    "Allâh has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this Qur’ân), its parts resembling each other (in goodness and truth) (and) oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when they recite it or hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allâh. That is the guidance of Allâh. He Guides therewith whom He wills; and whomever Allâh sends astray, for him there is no guide.",
    "Is he then, who will confront with his face the awful torment on the Day of Resurrection (as he who enters peacefully in Paradise)? And it will be said to the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers): \"Taste what you used to earn!\"",
    "Those before them belied, and so the torment came on them from directions they perceived not.",
    "So Allâh made them to taste the disgrace in the present life, but greater is the torment of the Hereafter if they only knew!",
    "And indeed We have put forth for men, in this Qur’ân every kind of similitude in order that they may remember.",
    "An Arabic Qur’ân, without any crookedness (therein) in order that they may avoid all evil which Allâh has ordered them to avoid, fear Him and keep their duty to Him.",
    "Allâh puts forth a similitude: a (slave) man belonging to many partners (like those who worship others along with Allâh) disputing with one another, and a (slave) man belonging entirely to one master (like those who worship Allâh Alone). Are those two equal in comparison? All the praises and thanks be to Allâh! But most of them know not.",
    "Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.",
    "Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be disputing before your Lord."
