    "Hâ-Mîm.",
    "The revelation of the Book (this Qur’ân) is from Allâh, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.",
    "We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth, and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned.",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to these pagans): \"Think you about all that you invoke besides Allâh? Show me. What have they created of the earth? Or have they a share in (the creation of) the heavens? Bring me a Book (revealed before this), or some trace of knowledge (in support of your claims), if you are truthful!\"",
    "And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allâh, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?",
    "And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.",
    "And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth (this Qur’ân) when it reaches them: \"This is plain magic!\"",
    "Or say they: \"He (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) has fabricated it.\" Say: \"If I have fabricated it? still you have no power to support me against Allâh. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur’ân)! Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you! And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\"",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers (of Allâh i.e. I am not the first Messenger) nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner.\"",
    "Say: \"Tell me! If this (Qur’ân) is from Allâh and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel (‘Abdullâh bin Salâm رضي الله عنه) testifies that [this Qur’ân is from Allâh (like the Taurât (Torah)], and he believed (embraced Islâm) while you are too proud (to believe).\" Verily, Allâh guides not the people who are Zâlimûn (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doers).",
    "And those who disbelieve (the strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (the weak and poor): \"Had it (Islâmic Monotheism to which Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is inviting mankind) been a good thing, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!\" And when they have not let themselves be guided by it (this Qur’ân), they say: \"This is an ancient lie!\"",
    "And before this was the Scripture of Mûsâ (Moses) as a guide and a mercy. And this is a confirming Book (the Qur’ân) in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings to the Muhsinûn (good-doers. See the footnote of V.:).",
    "Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is (only) Allâh,\" and thereafter stand firm and straight on the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.",
    "Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) - a reward for what they used to do.",
    "And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship, and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty months, till when he attains full strength and reaches forty years, he says: \"My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly, I am one of the Muslims (submitting to Your Will).\"",
    "They are those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds. (They shall be) among the dwellers of Paradise - a promise of truth, which they have been promised.",
    "But he who says to his parents: \"Fie upon you both! Do you hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up (again) when generations before me have passed away (without rising)?\" While they (father and mother) invoke Allâh for help (and rebuke their son): \"Woe to you! Believe! Verily, the Promise of Allâh is true.\" But he says: \"This is nothing but the tales of the ancient.\"",
    "They are those against whom the Word (of torment) is justified among the previous generations of jinn and mankind that have passed away. Verily, they are ever the losers.",
    "And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allâh) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged.",
    "On the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): \"You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein. Now this Day you shall be recompensed with a torment of humiliation, because you were arrogant in the land without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allâh’s Command (disobey Allâh).",
    "And remember (Hûd) the brother of ‘Âd, when he warned his people in Al-Ahqâf (the curved sand-hills in the southern part of Arabian Peninsula). And surely, there have passed away warners before him and after him (saying): \"Worship none but Allâh; truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).\"",
    "They said: \"Have you come to turn us away from our âlihah (gods)? Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!\"",
    "He said: \"The knowledge (of the time of its coming) is with Allâh only. And I convey to you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see that you are a people given to ignorance!\"",
    "Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: \"This is a cloud bringing us rain!\" Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened - a wind wherein is a painful torment!",
    "Destroying everything by the Command of its Lord! So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings! Thus do We recompense the people who are Mujrimûn (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners)!",
    "And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts; but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayât (Allâh’s Prophets and their Prophethood, proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations) of Allâh, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!",
    "And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism).",
    "Then why did those whom they had taken for âlihah (gods) besides Allâh, as a way of approach (to Allâh) not help them? Nay, but they vanished completely from them (when there came the torment). And that was their lie, and their inventions which they had been inventing (before their destruction).",
    "And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) a group (three to ten persons) of the jinn, (quietly) listening to the Qur’ân. When they stood in the presence thereof, they said: \"Listen in silence!\" And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners.",
    "They said: \"O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Qur’ân) sent down after Mûsâ (Moses), confirming what came before it: it guides to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islâm).",
    "O our people! Respond (with obedience) to Allâh’s Caller (i.e. Allâh’s Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and believe in him (i.e. believe in that which Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم has brought from Allâh and follow him). He (Allâh) will forgive you of your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire)",
    "And whosoever does not respond to Allâh’s Caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no Auliyâ’ (lords, helpers, supporters, protectors) for him besides Allâh (from Allâh’s punishment). Those are in manifest error.",
    "Do they not see that Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.",
    "And on the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said to them): \"Is this not the truth?\" They will say: \"Yes, By our Lord!\" He will say: \"Then taste the torment, because you used to disbelieve!\"",
    "Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! this Qur’ân is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are Al-Fâsiqûn (the rebellious against Allâh’s Command, the disobedient to Allâh)?",
    "Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh, and in the Message of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh (Islâmic Monotheism), He will render their deeds vain.",
    "But those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and believe in that which is sent down to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) - for it is the truth from their Lord - He will expiate from them their sins, and will make good their state.",
    "That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allâh set forth for mankind their parables.",
    "So, when you meet (in fight - Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause) those who disbelieve, smite (their) necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islâm), until the war lays down its burden. Thus [you are ordered by Allâh to continue in carrying out Jihâd against the disbelievers till they embrace Islâm and are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire or at least come under your protection], but if it had been Allâh’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allâh, He will never let their deeds be lost.",
    "He will guide them and set right their state.",
    "And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them (i.e. they will know their places in Paradise better than they used to know their homes in the world). [Tafsir Ibn Kathir ]",
    "O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.",
    "But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain.",
    "That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur’ân and Islâmic laws, etc.); so He has made their deeds fruitless.",
    "Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen what was the end of those before them? Allâh destroyed them completely, and a similar (fate awaits) the disbelievers.",
    "That is because Allâh is the Maulâ (Lord, Master, Helper, Protector, etc.) of those who believe, and the disbelievers have no Maulâ (lord, master, helper, protector, etc.).",
    "Certainly Allâh will admit those who believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise); while those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode.",
    "And many a town, stronger than your town (Makkah) (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) which has driven you out We have destroyed. And there was none to help them.",
    "Is he who is on a clear proof from his Lord, like those for whom their evil deeds that they do are beautified for them, while they follow their own lusts (evil desires)?",
    "The description of Paradise which the Muttaqûn (the pious. See V.:) have been promised (is that) in it are rivers of water the taste and smell of which are not changed, rivers of milk of which the taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of clarified honey (clear and pure) therein for them is every kind of fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord. (Are these) like those who shall dwell for ever in the Fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their bowels?",
    "And among them are some who listen to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) till when they go out from you, they say to those who have received knowledge: \"What has he said just now? Such are men whose hearts Allâh has sealed, and they follow their lusts (evil desires).",
    "While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and bestows on them their piety.",
    "Do they then await (anything) other than the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly? But some of its portents (indications and signs) have already come; and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their reminder?",
    "So know (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that, Lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women. And Allâh knows well your moving about, and your place of rest (in your homes).",
    "Those who believe say: \"Why is not a Sûrah (chapter of the Qur’ân) sent down (for us)? But when a decisive Sûrah (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, and fighting (Jihâd - holy fighting in Allâh’s cause) is mentioned (i.e. ordained) therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them (hypocrites, to listen to Allâh and to obey Him).",
    "Obedience (to Allâh) and good words (were better for them). And when the matter (preparation for Jihâd ) is resolved on, then if they had been true to Allâh, it would have been better for them.",
    "Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship?",
    "Such are they whom Allâh has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.",
    "Do they not then think deeply in the Qur’ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?",
    "Verily, those who have turned back (have apostatised) as disbelievers after the guidance has been manifested to them - Shaitân (Satan) has beautified for them (their false hopes), and (Allâh) prolonged their term (age).",
    "This is because they said to those who hate what Allâh has sent down: \"We will obey you in part of the matter.\" But Allâh knows their secrets.",
    "Then how (will it be) when the angels will take their souls at death, smiting their faces and their backs?",
    "That is because they followed that which angered Allâh and hated that which pleased Him. So He made their deeds fruitless.",
    "Or do those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy), think that Allâh will not bring to light all their hidden ill-wills?",
    "Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech! And Allâh knows (all) your deeds.",
    "And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the Cause of Allâh) and As-Sâbirûn (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e. the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).",
    "Verily, those who disbelieve, and hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh (i.e. Islâm), and oppose the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) (by standing against him and hurting him), after the guidance has been clearly shown to them, they will not harm Allâh in the least, but He will make their deeds fruitless,",
    "O you who believe! Obey Allâh, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and render not vain your deeds.",
    "Verily, those who disbelieve, and hinder (men) from the Path of Allâh (i.e. Islâm); then die while they are disbelievers - Allâh will not forgive them.",
    "So be not weak and ask not for peace (from the enemies of Islâm) while you are having the upper hand. Allâh is with you, and He will never decrease the reward of your good deeds.",
    "The life of this world is but play and pastime; but if you believe (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and fear Allâh, and avoid evil, He will grant you your wages, and will not ask you your wealth.",
    "If He were to ask you of it, and press you, you would covetously withhold, and He will bring out all your (secret) ill-wills.",
    "Behold! You are those who are called to spend in the Cause of Allâh, yet among you are some who are niggardly. And whoever is niggardly, it is only at the expense of his ownself. But Allâh is Rich (Free of all needs), and you (mankind) are poor. And if you turn away (from Islâm and the obedience to Allâh), He will exchange you for some other people and they will not be your likes.",
    "Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) a manifest victory.",
    "That Allâh may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His Favour on you, and guide you on the Straight Path,",
    "And that Allâh may help you with strong help.",
    "He it is Who sent down As-Sakînah (calmness and tranquillity) into the hearts of the believers, that they may grow more in Faith along with their (present) Faith. And to Allâh belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.",
    "That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e. Paradise), to abide therein forever, and He may expiate from them their sins; and that is with Allâh a supreme success,",
    "And that He may punish the Munâfiqûn (hypocrites), men and women, and also the Mushrikûn men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allâh: for them is a disgraceful torment. And the Anger of Allâh is upon them, and He has cursed them and prepared Hell for them - and worst indeed is that destination.",
    "And to Allâh belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth. And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.",
    "Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner.",
    "In order that you (O mankind) may believe in Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and that you assist and honour him (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (that you) glorify (Allâh’s) praises morning and afternoon.",
    "Verily, those who give Bai‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) they are giving Bai‘ah (pledge) to Allâh. The Hand of Allâh is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm; and whosoever fulfils what he has covenanted with Allâh, He will bestow on him a great reward.",
    "Those of the bedouins who lagged behind will say to you: \"Our possessions and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: \"Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with Allâh, if He intends you hurt or intends you benefit? Nay, but Allâh is Ever All-Aware of what you do.",
    "\"Nay, but you thought that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the believers would never return to their families, and that was made fair-seeming in your hearts, and you did think an evil thought and you became a useless people going for destruction.\"",
    "And whosoever does not believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire.",
    "And to Allâh belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils, \"Allow us to follow you.\" They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: \"You shall not follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand.\" Then they will say: \"Nay, you envy us.\" Nay, but they understand not except a little.",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to the bedouins who lagged behind: \"You shall be called to fight against a people given to great warfare, then you shall fight them, or they shall surrender. Then if you obey, Allâh will give you a fair reward; but if you turn away as you did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful torment.\"",
    "No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick (that they go not for fighting). And whosoever obeys Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), He will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow (Paradise); and whosoever turns back, He will punish him with a painful torment.",
    "Indeed, Allâh was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bai‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) under the tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakînah (calmness and tranquillity) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory.",
    "And abundant spoils that they will capture. And Allâh is Ever All-Mighty, All-Wise.",
    "Allâh has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture, and He has hastened for you this, and He has restrained the hands of men from you: that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to the Straight Path.",
    "And other (victories and much booty He promises you) which are not yet within your power; indeed Allâh compasses them. And Allâh is Ever Able to do all things.",
    "And if those who disbelieve fight against you, they certainly would have turned their backs; then they would have found neither a Walî (protector, guardian) nor a helper.",
    "That has been the Way of Allâh already with those who passed away before. And you will not find any change in the Way of Allâh.",
    "And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them. And Allâh is Ever the All-Seer of what you do.",
    "They are the ones who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) and hindered you from Al-Masjid-al-Harâm (at Makkah) and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allâh might bring into His Mercy whom He wills - if they (the believers and the disbelievers) had been apart, We verily would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment.",
    "When those who disbelieve had put in their hearts pride and haughtiness - the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance, - then Allâh sent down His Sakînah (calmness and tranquillity) upon His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and upon the believers, and made them stick to the word of piety (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh); and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.",
    "Indeed Allâh shall fulfil the true vision which He showed to His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) [i.e. the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saw a dream that he has entered Makkah along with his Companions, having their (head) hair shaved and cut short] in very truth. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid-al-Harâm, if Allâh wills, secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short, having no fear. He knew what you knew not, and He granted besides that a near victory.",
    "He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), that He may make it (Islâm) superior to all religions. And All-Sufficient is Allâh as a Witness.",
    "Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is the Messenger of Allâh. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allâh and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurât (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allâh has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islâmic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise).",
    "O you who believe! Make not (a decision) in advance before Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and fear Allâh. Verily! Allâh is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not.",
    "Verily, those who lower their voices in the presence of Allâh’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they are the ones whose hearts Allâh has tested for piety. For them is forgiveness and a great reward.",
    "Verily those who call you from behind the dwellings, most of them have no sense.",
    "And if they had patience till you could come out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "O you who believe! If a Fâsiq (liar - evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.",
    "And know that among you there is the Messenger of Allâh (صلى الله عليه وسلم). If he were to obey you (i.e. follow your opinions and desires) in much of the matter, you would surely be in trouble. But Allâh has endeared the Faith to you and has beautified it in your hearts, and has made disbelief, wickedness and disobedience (to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم) hateful to you. Such are they who are the rightly guided.",
    "(This is) a Grace from Allâh and His Favour. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the Command of Allâh. Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allâh loves those who are the equitable.",
    "The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islâmic religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allâh, that you may receive mercy.",
    "O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it to insult one’s brother after having Faith [i.e. to call your Muslim brother (a faithful believer) as: \"O sinner\", or \"O wicked\"]. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, etc.).",
    "O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.",
    "O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allâh is that (believer) who has At-Taqwâ [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqûn (the pious. See V.:)]. Verily, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Aware.",
    "The bedouins say: \"We believe.\" Say: \"You believe not but you only say, ‘We have surrendered (in Islâm),’ for Faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you obey Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), He will not decrease anything in reward for your deeds. Verily, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"",
    "Only those are the believers who have believed in Allâh and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allâh. Those! They are the truthful.",
    "Say: \"Will you inform Allâh of your religion while Allâh knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allâh is All-Aware of everything.",
    "They regard as favour to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that they have embraced Islâm. Say: \"Count not your Islâm as a favour to me. Nay, but Allâh has conferred a favour upon you that He has guided you to the Faith if you indeed are true.",
    "Verily, Allâh knows the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And Allâh is the All-Seer of what you do.",
    "Qâf. [These letters (Qâf, etc.) are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings]. By the Glorious Qur’ân.",
    "Nay, they wonder that there has come to them a warner (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) from among themselves. So the disbelievers say: \"This is a strange thing!",
    "\"When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be resurrected?) That is a far return.\"",
    "We know that which the earth takes of them (their dead bodies), and with Us is a Book preserved (i.e. the Book of Decrees).",
    "Nay, but they have denied the truth (this Qur’ân) when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state (cannot differentiate between right and wrong).",
    "Have they not looked at the heaven above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it?",
