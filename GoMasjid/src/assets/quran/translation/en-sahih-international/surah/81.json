    "When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness]",
    "And when the stars fall, dispersing,",
    "And when the mountains are removed",
    "And when full-term she-camels are neglected",
    "And when the wild beasts are gathered",
    "And when the seas are filled with flame",
    "And when the souls are paired",
    "And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked",
    "For what sin she was killed",
    "And when the pages are spread [i.e., made public]",
    "And when the sky is stripped away",
    "And when Hellfire is set ablaze",
    "And when Paradise is brought near,",
    "A soul will [then] know what it has brought [with it].",
    "So I swear by the retreating stars -",
    "Those that run [their courses] and disappear [i.e., set]",
    "And by the night as it closes in",
    "And by the dawn when it breathes [i.e., stirs]",
    "[That] indeed, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is a word [conveyed by] a noble messenger [i.e., Gabriel]",
    "[Who is] possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position],",
    "Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.",
    "And your companion [i.e., Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ) ] is not [at all] mad.",
    "And he has already seen him [i.e., Gabriel] in the clear horizon.",
    "And he [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] is not a withholder of [knowledge of] the unseen.",
    "And it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is not the word of a devil, expelled [from the heavens].",
    "So where are you going?",
    "It is not except a reminder to the worlds",
    "For whoever wills among you to take a right course.",
    "And you do not will except that Allāh wills - Lord of the worlds."
