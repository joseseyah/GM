    "And whoever of you devoutly obeys Allāh and His Messenger and does righteousness - We will give her her reward twice; and We have prepared for her a noble provision.",
    "O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women. If you fear Allāh, then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech.",
    "And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakāh and obey Allāh and His Messenger. Allāh intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification.",
    "And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allāh and wisdom. Indeed, Allāh is ever Subtle and Aware.",
    "Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allāh often and the women who do so - for them Allāh has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.",
    "It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allāh and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allāh and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.",
    "And [remember, O Muḥammad], when you said to the one on whom Allāh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, \"Keep your wife and fear Allāh,\" while you concealed within yourself that which Allāh is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allāh has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed [i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of Allāh accomplished.",
    "There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allāh has imposed upon him. [This is] the established way of Allāh with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And ever is the command of Allāh a destiny decreed.",
    "[Allāh praises] those who convey the messages of Allāh and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allāh. And sufficient is Allāh as Accountant.",
    "Muḥammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allāh and seal [i.e., last] of the prophets. And ever is Allāh, of all things, Knowing.",
    "O you who have believed, remember Allāh with much remembrance",
    "And exalt Him morning and afternoon.",
    "It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels [ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful.",
    "Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, \"Peace.\" And He has prepared for them a noble reward.",
    "O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner",
    "And one who invites to Allāh, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp.",
    "And give good tidings to the believers that they will have from Allāh great bounty.",
    "And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and disregard their annoyance, and rely upon Allāh. And sufficient is Allāh as Disposer of affairs.",
    "O you who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them [i.e., consummated the marriage], then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them. So provide for them and give them a gracious release.",
    "O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what Allāh has returned to you [of captives] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her; [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] in order that there will be upon you no discomfort [i.e., difficulty]. And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "You, [O Muḥammad], may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will. And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. That is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them. And Allāh knows what is in your hearts. And ever is Allāh Knowing and Forbearing.",
    "Not lawful to you, [O Muḥammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you, except what your right hand possesses. And ever is Allāh, over all things, an Observer.",
    "O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allāh is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of Allāh or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allāh an enormity.",
    "Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, indeed Allāh is ever, of all things, Knowing.",
    "There is no blame upon them [i.e., women] concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons or their women or those their right hands possess [i.e., slaves]. And fear Allāh. Indeed Allāh is ever, over all things, Witness.",
    "Indeed, Allāh confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allāh to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allāh to grant him] peace.",
    "Indeed, those who abuse Allāh and His Messenger - Allāh has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment.",
    "And those who harm believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned [i.e., deserved] have certainly borne upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.",
    "O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in al-Madīnah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little,",
    "Accursed wherever they are found, [being] seized and massacred completely.",
    "[This is] the established way of Allāh with those who passed on before; and you will not find in the way of Allāh any change.",
    "People ask you concerning the Hour. Say, \"Knowledge of it is only with Allāh. And what may make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.\"",
    "Indeed, Allāh has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.",
    "Abiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper.",
    "The Day their faces will be turned about in the Fire, they will say, \"How we wish we had obeyed Allāh and obeyed the Messenger.\"",
    "And they will say, \"Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries, and they led us astray from the [right] way.",
    "Our Lord, give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse.\"",
    "O you who have believed, be not like those who abused Moses; then Allāh cleared him of what they said. And he, in the sight of Allāh, was distinguished.",
    "O you who have believed, fear Allāh and speak words of appropriate justice.",
    "He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allāh and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.",
    "Indeed, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant.",
    "[It was] so that Allāh may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with Him and that Allāh may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women. And ever is Allāh Forgiving and Merciful.",
    "[All] praise is [due] to Allāh, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him belongs [all] praise in the Hereafter. And He is the Wise, the Aware.",
    "He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.",
    "But those who disbelieve say, \"The Hour will not come to us.\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you. [Allāh is] the Knower of the unseen.\" Not absent from Him is an atom's weight within the heavens or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register -",
    "That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness and noble provision.",
    "But those who strive against Our verses [seeking] to cause failure - for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature.",
    "And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy.",
    "But those who disbelieve say, \"Shall we direct you to a man who will inform you [that] when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new creation?",
    "Has he invented about Allāh a lie or is there in him madness?\" Rather, they who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment and [are in] extreme error.",
    "Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to Allāh].",
    "And We certainly gave David from Us bounty. [We said], \"O mountains, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as well].\" And We made pliable for him iron,",
    "[Commanding him], \"Make full coats of mail and calculate [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Seeing.\"",
    "And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind - its morning [journey was that of] a month - and its afternoon [journey was that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. And among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze.",
    "They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers, statues, bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles. [We said], \"Work, O family of David, in gratitude.\" And few of My servants are grateful.",
    "And when We decreed for him [i.e., Solomon] death, nothing indicated to them [i.e., the jinn] his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff. But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.",
    "There was for [the tribe of] Saba’ in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], \"Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord.\"",
    "But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees.",
    "[By] that We repaid them because they disbelieved. And do We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?",
    "And We placed between them and the cities which We had blessed [many] visible cities. And We determined between them the [distances of] journey, [saying], \"Travel between them by night or by day in safety.\"",
    "But [insolently] they said, \"Our Lord, lengthen the distance between our journeys,\" and wronged themselves, so We made them narrations and dispersed them in total dispersion. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.",
    "And Iblees had already confirmed through them his assumption, so they followed him, except for a party of believers.",
    "And he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is thereof in doubt. And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian.",
    "Say, [O Muḥammad], \"Invoke those you claim [as deities] besides Allāh.\" They do not possess an atom's weight [of ability] in the heavens or on the earth, and they do not have therein any partnership [with Him], nor is there for Him from among them any assistant.",
    "And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until, when terror is removed from their hearts, they will say [to one another], \"What has your Lord said?\" They will say, \"The truth.\" And He is the Most High, the Grand.",
    "Say, \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allāh. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error.\"",
    "Say, \"You will not be asked about what we committed, and we will not be asked about what you do.\"",
    "Say, \"Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Knowing Judge.\"",
    "Say, \"Show me those whom you have attached to Him as partners. No! Rather, He [alone] is Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"",
    "And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know.",
    "And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"",
    "Say, \"For you is the appointment of a Day [when] you will not remain thereafter an hour, nor will you precede [it].\"",
    "And those who disbelieve say, \"We will never believe in this Qur’ān nor in that before it.\" But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, refuting each others' words... Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, \"If not for you, we would have been believers.\"",
    "Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, \"Did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you were criminals.\"",
    "Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, \"Rather, [it was your] conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in Allāh and attribute to Him equals.\" But they will [all] confide regret when they see the punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be recompensed except for what they used to do?",
    "And We did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said, \"Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers.\"",
    "And they said, \"We are more [than the believers] in wealth and children, and we are not to be punished.\"",
    "Say, \"Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it], but most of the people do not know.\"",
    "And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us in position, but it is [by being] one who has believed and done righteousness. For them there will be the double reward for what they did, and they will be in the upper chambers [of Paradise], safe [and secure].",
    "And the ones who strive against Our verses to cause [them] failure - those will be brought into the punishment [to remain].",
    "Say, \"Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts [it] for him. But whatever thing you spend [in His cause] - He will compensate it; and He is the best of providers.\"",
    "And [mention] the Day when He will gather them all and then say to the angels, \"Did these [people] used to worship you?\"",
    "They will say, \"Exalted are You! You, [O Allāh], are our benefactor excluding [i.e., not] them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them.\"",
    "But today [i.e., the Day of Judgement] you do not hold for one another [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged, \"Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you used to deny.\"",
    "And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, they say, \"This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping.\" And they say, \"This is not except a lie invented.\" And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"",
    "And We had not given them any scriptures which they could study, and We had not sent to them before you, [O Muḥammad], any warner.",
    "And those before them denied, and they [i.e., the people of Makkah] have not attained a tenth of what We had given them. But they [i.e., the former peoples] denied My messengers, so how [terrible] was My reproach.",
    "Say, \"I only advise you of one [thing] - that you stand for Allāh, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\" There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment.",
    "Say, \"Whatever payment I might have asked of you - it is yours. My payment is only from Allāh, and He is, over all things, Witness.\"",
    "Say, \"Indeed, my Lord projects the truth, Knower of the unseen.\"",
    "Say, \"The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it].\"",
    "Say, \"If I should err, I would only err against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and near.\"",
    "And if you could see when they are terrified but there is no escape, and they will be seized from a place nearby.",
    "And they will [then] say, \"We believe in it!\" But how for them will be the taking [of faith] from a place far away?",
    "And they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault the unseen from a place far away.",
    "And prevention will be placed between them and what they desire, as was done with their kind before. Indeed, they were in disquieting doubt [i.e., denial].",
    "[All] praise is [due] to Allāh, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allāh is over all things competent.",
    "Whatever Allāh grants to people of mercy - none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds - none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.",
    "O mankind, remember the favor of Allāh upon you. Is there any creator other than Allāh who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?",
    "And if they deny you, [O Muḥammad] - already were messengers denied before you. And to Allāh are returned [all] matters.",
    "O mankind, indeed the promise of Allāh is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about Allāh by the Deceiver [i.e., Satan].",
    "Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.",
    "Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward.",
    "Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allāh sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allāh is Knowing of what they do.",
    "And it is Allāh who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection.",
    "Whoever desires honor [through power] - then to Allāh belongs all honor. To Him ascends good speech, and righteous work raises it. But they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment, and the plotting of those - it will perish.",
    "And Allāh created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop; then He made you mates. And no female conceives nor does she give birth except with His knowledge. And no aged person is granted [additional] life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register. Indeed, that for Allāh is easy.",
    "And not alike are the two seas [i.e., bodies of water]. One is fresh and sweet, palatable for drinking, and one is salty and bitter. And from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through [them] that you might seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.",
    "He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon - each running [its course] for a specified term. That is Allāh, your Lord; to Him belongs sovereignty. And those whom you invoke other than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date seed.",
    "If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association. And none can inform you like [one] Aware [of all matters].",
    "O mankind, you are those in need of Allāh, while Allāh is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.",
    "If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation.",
    "And that is for Allāh not difficult.",
    "And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul. And to Allāh is the [final] destination.",
    "Not equal are the blind and the seeing,",
    "Nor are the darknesses and the light,",
    "Nor are the shade and the heat,",
    "And not equal are the living and the dead. Indeed, Allāh causes to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.",
    "You, [O Muḥammad], are not but a warner.",
    "Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.",
    "And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture.",
    "Then I seized the ones who disbelieved, and how [terrible] was My reproach.",
    "Do you not see that Allāh sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And in the mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and [some] extremely black.",
    "And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly. Only those fear Allāh, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, Allāh is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.",
    "Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allāh and establish prayer and spend [in His cause] out of what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, [can] expect a transaction [i.e., profit] that will never perish -",
    "That He may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of His bounty. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Appreciative.",
    "And that which We have revealed to you, [O Muḥammad], of the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it. Indeed Allāh, of His servants, is Aware and Seeing.",
    "Then We caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants; and among them is he who wrongs himself [i.e., sins], and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of Allāh. That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.",
    "[For them are] gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be silk.",
    "And they will say, \"Praise to Allāh, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative -",
    "He who has settled us in the home of duration [i.e., Paradise] out of His bounty. There touches us not in it any fatigue, and there touches us not in it weariness [of mind].\"",
    "And for those who disbelieve will be the fire of Hell. [Death] is not decreed for them so they may die, nor will its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We recompense every ungrateful one.",
    "And they will cry out therein, \"Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness - other than what we were doing!\" But did We not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.",
    "Indeed, Allāh is Knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.",
    "It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves - upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss.",
    "Say, \"Have you considered your 'partners' whom you invoke besides Allāh? Show me what they have created from the earth, or have they partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evidence therefrom? [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion.\"",
    "Indeed, Allāh holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.",
    "And they swore by Allāh their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations. But when a warner came to them, it did not increase them except in aversion",
    "[Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way [i.e., fate] of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way [i.e., established method] of Allāh any change, and you will never find in the way of Allāh any alteration.",
    "Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? And they were greater than them in power. But Allāh is not to be caused failure [i.e., prevented] by anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is ever Knowing and Competent.",
    "And if Allāh were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned, He would not leave upon it [i.e., the earth] any creature. But He defers them for a specified term. And when their time comes, then indeed Allāh has ever been, of His servants, Seeing.",
    "Yā, Seen.",
    "By the wise Qur’ān,",
    "Indeed you, [O Muḥammad], are from among the messengers,",
    "On a straight path.",
    "[This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,",
    "That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.",
    "Already the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.",
    "Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.",
    "And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see.",
    "And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.",
    "You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.",
    "Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register.",
    "And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it -",
    "When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened [them] with a third, and they said, \"Indeed, we are messengers to you.\"",
    "They said, \"You are not but human beings like us, and the Most Merciful has not revealed a thing. You are only telling lies.\"",
    "They said, \"Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you,",
    "And we are not responsible except for clear notification.\"",
    "They said, \"Indeed, we consider you a bad omen. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you, and there will surely touch you, from us, a painful punishment.\"",
    "They said, \"Your omen [i.e., fate] is with yourselves. Is it because you were reminded? Rather, you are a transgressing people.\"",
    "And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running. He said, \"O my people, follow the messengers.",
    "Follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided."
