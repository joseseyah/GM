    "And whoever of you devoutly obeys Allah and His Messenger and does good, We will grant her double the reward, and We have prepared for her an honourable provision.",
    "O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women: if you are mindful ˹of Allah˺, then do not be overly effeminate in speech ˹with men˺ or those with sickness in their hearts may be tempted, but speak in a moderate tone.",
    "Settle in your homes, and do not display yourselves as women did in the days of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only intends to keep ˹the causes of˺ evil away from you and purify you completely, O  members of the ˹Prophet’s˺ family!",
    "˹Always˺ remember what is recited in your homes of Allah’s revelations and ˹prophetic˺ wisdom. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware.",
    "Surely ˹for˺ Muslim men and women, believing men and women, devout men and women, truthful men and women, patient men and women, humble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and women, men and women who guard their chastity, and men and women who remember Allah often—for ˹all of˺ them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.",
    "It is not for a believing man or woman—when Allah and His Messenger decree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter. Indeed, whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone ˹far˺ astray.",
    "And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when you said to the one for whom Allah has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour, “Keep your wife and fear Allah,” while concealing within yourself what Allah was going to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas Allah was more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in ˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And Allah’s command is totally binding.",
    "There is no blame on the Prophet for doing what Allah has ordained for him. That has been the way of Allah with those ˹prophets˺ who had gone before. And Allah’s command has been firmly decreed.",
    "˹That is His way with˺ those ˹prophets˺ who deliver the messages of Allah, and consider Him, and none but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner.",
    "Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
    "O believers! Always remember Allah often,",
    "and glorify Him morning and evening.",
    "He is the One Who showers His blessings upon you—and His angels pray for you—so that He may bring you out of darkness and into light. For He is ever Merciful to the believers.",
    "Their greeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace!” And He has prepared for them an honourable reward.",
    "O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness, and a deliverer of good news, and a warner,",
    "and a caller to ˹the Way of˺ Allah by His command, and a beacon of light.",
    "Give good news to the believers that they will have a great bounty from Allah.",
    "Do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Overlook their annoyances, and put your trust in Allah. For Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.",
    "O believers! If you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, they will have no waiting period for you to count, so give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation, and let them go graciously.",
    "O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you. And ˹you are allowed to marry˺ the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated like you. Also ˹allowed for marriage is˺ a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet ˹without dowry˺ if he is interested in marrying her—˹this is˺ exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers. We know well what ˹rulings˺ We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession. As such, there would be no blame on you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "It is up to you ˹O Prophet˺ to delay or receive whoever you please of your wives. There is no blame on you if you call back any of those you have set aside. That is more likely that they will be content, not grieved, and satisfied with what you offer them all. Allah ˹fully˺ knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.",
    "It is not lawful for you ˹O Prophet˺ to marry more women after this, nor can you replace any of your present wives with another, even if her beauty may attract you—except those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.",
    "O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.",
    "Whether you reveal something or conceal it, surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
    "There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives ˹if they appear unveiled˺ before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their fellow ˹Muslim˺ women, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession. And be mindful of Allah ˹O wives of the Prophet!˺ Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.",
    "Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O  believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace.",
    "Surely those who offend Allah and His Messenger are condemned by Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.",
    "As for those who abuse believing men and women unjustifiably, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin.",
    "O Prophet! Ask your wives, daughters, and believing women to draw their cloaks over their bodies. In this way it is more likely that they will be recognized ˹as virtuous˺ and not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. ",
    "If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and rumour-mongers in Medina do not desist, We will certainly incite you ˹O Prophet˺ against them, and then they will not be your neighbours there any longer.",
    "˹They deserve to be˺ condemned. ˹If they were to persist,˺ they would get themselves seized and killed relentlessly wherever they are found!",
    "That was Allah’s way with those ˹hypocrites˺ who have gone before. And you will find no change in Allah’s way.",
    "People ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the Hour. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah. You never know, perhaps the Hour is near.”",
    "Surely Allah condemns the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a blazing Fire,",
    "to stay there for ever and ever—never will they find any protector or helper.",
    "On the Day their faces are ˹constantly˺ flipped in the Fire, they will cry, “Oh! If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!”",
    "And they will say, “Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and elite, but they led us astray from the ˹Right˺ Way.",
    "Our Lord! Give them double ˹our˺ punishment, and condemn them tremendously.”",
    "O believers! Do not be like those who slandered Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said. And he was honourable in the sight of Allah.",
    "O  believers! Be mindful of Allah, and say what is right.",
    "He will bless your deeds for you, and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, has truly achieved a great triumph.",
    "Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they ˹all˺ declined to bear it, being fearful of it. But humanity assumed it, ˹for˺ they are truly wrongful ˹to themselves˺ and ignorant ˹of the consequences˺,",
    "so that Allah will punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, and Allah will turn in mercy to believing men and women. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. ",
    "All praise is for Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And praise be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.",
    "He knows whatever goes into the earth and whatever comes out of it, and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends into it. And He is the Most Merciful, All-Forgiving.",
    "The disbelievers say, “The Hour will never come to us.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Yes—by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen—it will certainly come to you!” Not ˹even˺ an atom’s weight is hidden from Him in the heavens or the earth; nor anything smaller or larger than that, but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.",
    "So He may reward those who believe and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.",
    "As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain.",
    "Those gifted with knowledge ˹clearly˺ see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, and that it guides to the Path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.",
    "The disbelievers say ˹mockingly to one another˺, “Shall we show you a man who claims that when you have been utterly disintegrated you will be raised as a new creation?",
    "Has he fabricated a lie against Allah or is he insane?” In fact, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are bound for torment and have strayed farthest ˹from the truth˺.",
    "Have they not then seen all that surrounds them of the heavens and the earth? If We willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause ˹deadly˺ pieces of the sky to fall upon them. Surely in this is a sign for every servant who turns ˹to Allah˺.",
    "Indeed, We granted David a ˹great˺ privilege from Us, ˹commanding:˺ “O mountains! Echo his hymns! And the birds as well.” We made iron mouldable for him,",
    "instructing: “Make full-length armour, ˹perfectly˺ balancing the links. And work righteousness ˹O family of David!˺. Indeed, I am All-Seeing of what you do.”",
    "And to Solomon ˹We subjected˺ the wind: its morning stride was a month’s journey and so was its evening stride. And We caused a stream of molten copper to flow for him, and ˹We subjected˺ some of the jinn to work under him by his Lord’s Will. And whoever of them deviated from Our command, We made them taste the torment of the blaze.",
    "They made for him whatever he desired of sanctuaries, statues, basins as large as reservoirs, and cooking pots fixed ˹into the ground˺. ˹We ordered:˺ “Work gratefully, O  family of David!” ˹Only˺ a few of My servants are ˹truly˺ grateful.",
    "When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff. So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating servitude.",
    "Indeed, there was a sign for ˹the tribe of˺ Sheba in their homeland: two orchards—one to the right and the other to the left. ˹They were told:˺ “Eat from the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him. ˹Yours is˺ a good land and a forgiving Lord.”",
    "But they turned away. So We sent against them a devastating flood, and replaced their orchards with two others producing bitter fruit, fruitless bushes, and a few ˹sparse˺ thorny trees.",
    "This is how We rewarded them for their ingratitude. Would We ever punish ˹anyone in such a way˺ except the ungrateful?",
    "We had also placed between them and the cities We showered with blessings ˹many small˺ towns within sight of one another. And We set moderate travel distances in between, ˹saying,˺ “Travel between them by day and night safely.”",
    "But they said, “Our Lord! Make ˹the distances of˺ our journeys longer,” wronging themselves. So We reduced them to ˹cautionary˺ tales, and scattered them utterly. Surely in this are lessons for whoever is steadfast, grateful.",
    "Indeed, Iblîs’ assumption about them has come true, so they ˹all˺ follow him, except a group of ˹true˺ believers.",
    "He does not have any authority over them, but ˹Our Will is˺ only to distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. And your Lord is a ˹vigilant˺ Keeper over all things.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon those you claim ˹to be divine˺ besides Allah. They do not possess ˹even˺ an atom’s weight either in the heavens or the earth, nor do they have any share in ˹governing˺ them. Nor is any of them a helper to Him.”",
    "No intercession will be of any benefit with Him, except by those granted permission by Him. ˹At last,˺ when the dread ˹of Judgment Day˺ is relieved from their hearts ˹because they are permitted to intercede˺, they will ˹excitedly˺ ask ˹the angels˺, “What has your Lord ˹just˺ said?” The angels will reply, “The truth! And He is the Most High, All-Great.”",
    "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah! Now, certainly one of our two groups is ˹rightly˺ guided; the other is clearly astray.”",
    "Say, “You will not be accountable for our misdeeds, nor will we be accountable for your deeds.”",
    "Say, “Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.”",
    "Say, “Show me those ˹idols˺ you have joined with Him as partners. No! In fact, He ˹alone˺ is Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.”",
    "We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a warner to all of humanity, but most people do not know.",
    "And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “A Day has ˹already˺ been appointed for you, which you can neither delay nor advance by a ˹single˺ moment.”",
    "The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those ˹Scriptures˺ before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be detained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly ˹followers˺ will say to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers.”",
    "The arrogant will respond to the lowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact, you were wicked ˹on your own˺.”",
    "The lowly will say to the arrogant, “No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” They will ˹all˺ hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around the necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they used to do?",
    "Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, “We truly reject what you have been sent with.”",
    "Adding, “We are far superior ˹to the believers˺ in wealth and children, and we will never be punished.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.”",
    "It is not your wealth or children that bring you closer to Us. But those who believe and do good—it is they who will have a multiplied reward for what they did, and they will be secure in ˹elevated˺ mansions.",
    "As for those who strive to discredit Our revelations, it is they who will be confined in punishment.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And whatever you spend in charity, He will compensate ˹you˺ for it. For He is the Best Provider.”",
    "And ˹consider˺ the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, “Was it you that these ˹polytheists˺ used to worship?”",
    "They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they ˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn, in whom most of them had faith.”",
    "So Today neither of you can benefit or protect each other. And We will say to the wrongdoers, “Taste the torment of the Fire, which you used to deny.”",
    "When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to worship.” They also say, “This ˹Quran˺ is no more than a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is nothing but pure magic.”",
    "˹They say so even though˺ We had never given them any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before you ˹O Prophet˺.",
    "Those ˹destroyed˺ before them denied as well—and these ˹Meccans˺ have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given their predecessors. Yet ˹when˺ they denied My messengers, how severe was My response!",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I advise you to do ˹only˺ one thing: stand up for ˹the sake of˺ Allah—individually or in pairs—then reflect. Your fellow man is not insane. He is only a warner to you before ˹the coming of˺ a severe punishment.”",
    "Say, “If I had ever asked you for a reward, you could keep it. My reward is only from Allah. And He is a Witness over all things.”",
    "Say, “Surely my Lord hurls the truth ˹against falsehood˺. ˹He is˺ the Knower of all unseen.”",
    "Say, “The truth has come, and falsehood will vanish, never to return.”",
    "Say, “If I am astray, the loss is only mine. And if I am guided, it is ˹only˺ because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed All-Hearing, Ever Near.”",
    "If only you could see when they will be horrified with no escape ˹on Judgment Day˺! And they will be seized from a nearby place.",
    "They will ˹then˺ cry, “We do ˹now˺ believe in it ˹all˺.” But how could they ˹possibly˺ attain faith from a place so far-off ˹from the world˺,",
    "while they had already rejected it before, guessing blindly from a place ˹equally˺ far-away ˹from the Hereafter˺?",
    "They will be sealed off from whatever they desire, as was done to their counterparts before. Indeed, they were ˹all˺ in alarming doubt.",
    "All praise is for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made angels ˹as His˺ messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
    "Whatever mercy Allah opens up for people, none can withhold it. And whatever He withholds, none but Him can release it. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "O humanity! Remember Allah’s favours upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?",
    "If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺.",
    "O humanity! Indeed, Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah.",
    "Surely Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his followers to become inmates of the Blaze.",
    "Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do good will have forgiveness and a great reward.",
    "Are those whose evil-doing is made so appealing to them that they deem it good ˹like those who are rightly guided˺? ˹It is˺ certainly Allah ˹Who˺ leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides whoever He wills. So do not grieve yourself to death over them ˹O Prophet˺. Surely Allah is All-Knowing of what they do.",
    "And it is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour, forming˺ clouds, and then We drive them to a lifeless land, giving life to the earth after its death. Similar is the Resurrection.",
    "Whoever seeks honour and power, then ˹let them know that˺ all honour and power belongs to Allah. To Him ˹alone˺ good words ascend, and righteous deeds are raised up by Him. As for those who plot evil, they will suffer a severe punishment. And the plotting of such ˹people˺ is doomed ˹to fail˺.",
    "And ˹it is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ created you from dust, then ˹developed you˺ from a sperm-drop, then made you into pairs. No female ever conceives or delivers without His knowledge. And no one’s life is made long or cut short but is ˹written˺ in a Record. That is certainly easy for Allah.",
    "The two bodies of water are not alike: one is fresh, palatable, and pleasant to drink and the other is salty and bitter. Yet from them both you eat tender seafood and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships ploughing their way through both, so you may seek His bounty and give thanks ˹to Him˺.",
    "He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. But those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Him do not possess even the skin of a date stone.",
    "If you call upon them, they cannot hear your calls. And if they were to hear, they could not respond to you. On the Day of Judgment they will disown your worship ˹of them˺. And no one can inform you ˹O Prophet˺ like the All-Knowledgeable.",
    "O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.",
    "If He willed, He could eliminate you and produce a new creation.",
    "And that is not difficult for Allah ˹at all˺.",
    "No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And if a sin-burdened soul cries for help with its burden, none of it will be carried—even by a close relative. You ˹O Prophet˺ can only warn those who stand in awe of their Lord without seeing Him and establish prayer. Whoever purifies themselves, they only do so for their own good. And to Allah is the final return.",
    "Those blind ˹to the truth˺ and those who can see are not equal,",
    "nor are the darkness and the light,",
    "nor the ˹scorching˺ heat and the ˹cool˺ shade.",
    "Nor are the dead and the living equal. Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ makes whoever He wills hear, but you ˹O Prophet˺ can never make those in the graves hear ˹your call˺.",
    "You are only a warner.",
    "We have surely sent you with the truth as a deliverer of good news and a warner. There is no community that has not had a warner.",
    "If they deny you, so did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.",
    "Then I seized those who persisted in disbelief. How severe was My response!",
    "Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky with which We bring forth fruits of different colours? And in the mountains are streaks of varying shades of white, red, and raven black;",
    "just as people, living beings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of Allah’s servants, only the knowledgeable ˹of His might˺ are ˹truly˺ in awe of Him. Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Forgiving.",
    "Surely those who recite the Book of Allah, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—˹can˺ hope for an exchange that will never fail,",
    "so that He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. He is truly All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.",
    "The Book We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, confirming what came before it. Surely Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.",
    "Then We granted the Book to those We have chosen from Our servants. Some of them wrong themselves, some follow a middle course, and some are foremost in good deeds by Allah’s Will. That is ˹truly˺ the greatest bounty.",
    "They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk.",
    "And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, Who has kept away from us all ˹causes of˺ sorrow. Our Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.",
    "˹He is the One˺ Who—out of His grace—has settled us in the Home of Everlasting Stay, where we will be touched by neither fatigue nor weariness.”",
    "As for the disbelievers, they will have the Fire of Hell, where they will not be ˹allowed to be˺ finished by death, nor will its torment be lightened for them. This is how We reward every ˹stubborn˺ disbeliever.",
    "There they will be ˹fervently˺ screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out ˹and send us back˺. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” ˹They will be told,˺ “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be mindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste ˹the punishment˺, for the wrongdoers have no helper.”",
    "Indeed, Allah is the Knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
    "He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth. So whoever disbelieves will bear ˹the burden of˺ their own disbelief. The disbelievers’ denial only increases them in contempt in the sight of their Lord, and it will only contribute to their loss.",
    "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Have you considered your associate-gods which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens? Or have We given the polytheists a Book, which serves as a clear proof for them? In fact, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.”",
    "Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ keeps the heavens and the earth from falling apart. If they were to fall apart, none but Him could hold them up. He is truly Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.",
    "They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner were to come to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other community. Yet when a warner did come to them, it only drove them farther away—",
    "behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil. But evil plotting only backfires on those who plot. Are they awaiting anything but the fate of those ˹destroyed˺ before? You will find no change in the way of Allah, nor will you find it diverted ˹to someone else˺.",
    "Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might. But there is nothing that can escape Allah in the heavens or the earth. He is certainly All-Knowing, Most Capable.",
    "If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for what they have committed, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, then surely Allah is All-Seeing of His servants.",
    "Yâ-Sĩn.",
    "By the Quran, rich in wisdom!",
    "You ˹O Prophet˺ are truly one of the messengers",
    "upon the Straight Path.",
    "˹This is˺ a revelation from the Almighty, Most Merciful,",
    "so that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so are heedless.",
    "The decree ˹of torment˺ has already been justified against most of them, for they will never believe.",
    "˹It is as if˺ We have put shackles around their necks up to their chins, so their heads are forced up,",
    "and have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and covered them ˹all˺ up, so they fail to see ˹the truth˺.",
    "It is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe.",
    "You can only warn those who follow the Reminder and are in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing Him. So give them good news of forgiveness and an honourable reward.",
    "It is certainly We Who resurrect the dead, and write what they send forth and what they leave behind. Everything is listed by Us in a perfect Record. ",
    "Give them an example ˹O Prophet˺ of the residents of a town, when the messengers came to them.",
    "We sent them two messengers, but they rejected both. So We reinforced ˹the two˺ with a third, and they declared, “We have indeed been sent to you ˹as messengers˺.”",
    "The people replied, “You are only humans like us, and the Most Compassionate has not revealed anything. You are simply lying!”",
    "The messengers responded, “Our Lord knows that we have truly been sent to you.",
    "And our duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”",
    "The people replied, “We definitely see you as a bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will certainly stone you ˹to death˺ and you will be touched with a painful punishment from us.”",
    "The messengers said, “Your bad omen lies within yourselves. Are you saying this because you are reminded ˹of the truth˺? In fact, you are a transgressing people.”",
    "Then from the farthest end of the city a man came, rushing. He advised, “O my people! Follow the messengers.",
    "Follow those who ask no reward of you, and are ˹rightly˺ guided."
