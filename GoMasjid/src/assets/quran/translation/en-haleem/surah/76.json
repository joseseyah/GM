    "Was there not a period of time when man was nothing to speak of ?",
    "We created man from a drop of mingled fluid to put him to the test; We gave him hearing and sight;",
    "We guided him to the right path, whether he was grateful or not.",
    "We have prepared chains, iron collars, and blazing Fire for the disbelievers, but",
    "the righteous will have a drink mixed with kafur,",
    "a spring for God’s servants, which flows abundantly at their wish.",
    "They fulfil their vows; they fear a day of widespread woes;",
    "they give food to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, though they love it themselves,",
    "saying, ‘We feed you for the sake of God alone: We seek neither recompense nor thanks from you.",
    "We fear the Day of our Lord––a woefully grim Day.’",
    "So God will save them from the woes of that Day, give them radiance and gladness,",
    "and reward them, for their steadfastness, with a Garden and silken robes.",
    "They will sit on couches, feeling neither scorching heat nor biting cold,",
    "with shady [branches] spread above them and clusters of fruit hanging close at hand.",
    "They will be served with silver plates",
    "and gleaming silver goblets according to their fancy,",
    "and they will be given a drink infused with ginger",
    "from a spring called Salsabil.",
    "Everlasting youths will attend them––if you could see them, you would think they were scattered pearls––",
    "and if you were to look around, you would see bliss and great wealth:",
    "they will wear garments of green silk and brocade; they will be adorned with silver bracelets; their Lord will give them a pure drink.",
    "[It will be said], ‘This is your reward. Your endeavours are appreciated.’",
    "We Ourself have sent down this Quran to you [Prophet] in gradual revelation.",
    "Await your Lord’s Judgement with patience; do not yield to any of these sinners or disbelievers;",
    "remember the name of your Lord at dawn and in the evening;",
    "bow down before Him, and glorify Him at length by night.",
    "These people love the fleeting life. They put aside [all thoughts of] a Heavy Day.",
    "Yet We created them; We strengthened their constitution; if We please, We can replace such people completely.",
    "This is a reminder. Let whoever wishes, take the way to his Lord.",
    "But you will only wish to do so if God wills- God is all knowing, all wise-",
    "He admits whoever He will into His Mercy and has prepared a painful torment for the disbelievers."
