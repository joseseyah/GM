    "When the sky is ripped apart,",

    "obeying its Lord as it rightly must,",
    "you humans, toiling laboriously towards your Lord, will meet Him:",
    "whoever is given his record in his right hand",
    "will have an easy reckoning",
    "and return to his people well pleased,",
    "but whoever is given his record from behind his back",
    "will cry out for destruction––",
    "he will burn in the blazing Fire.",
    "He used to live among his people well pleased.",
    "He thought he would never return [to his Lord]––",
    "indeed he will! His Lord was watching him.",
    "I swear by the glow of sunset,",
    "by the night and what it covers,",
    "by the full moon,",
    "you will progress from stage to stage.",
    "So why do they not believe?",
    "Why, when the Quran is read to them, do they not prostrate themselves [to God]?",
    "No! The disbelievers reject the Quran––",
    "God knows best what they keep hidden inside––",
    "so give them news of a painful torment.",
    "But those who believe and do good deeds will have a never-ending reward."
