    "Everything that is in the heavens and earth glorifies God; all control and all praise belong to Him; He has power over everything.",
    "It is He who created you, yet some of you disbelieve and some believe: God sees everything you do.",
    "He created the heavens and earth for a true purpose; He formed you and made your forms good: you will all return to Him.",
    "He knows what is in the heavens and earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; God knows very well the secrets of every heart.",
    "[Disbelievers], have you not heard about those who disbelieved before you? They tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and a painful torment awaits them.",
    "That is because their messengers came to them with clear signs, yet they said, ‘Should we take guidance from mere mortals?’, rejected the message, and turned away. But God had no need for them: He is all sufficient, worthy of all praise.",
    "The disbelievers claim they will not be raised from the dead. Say [Prophet], ‘Yes indeed! I swear by my Lord! You will be raised and then you will be informed about everything you have done: an easy matter for God.’",
    "So believe in God, in His Messenger, and in the light We have sent down: God is fully aware of what you do.",
    "When He gathers you for the Day of Gathering, the Day of mutual neglect, He will cancel the sins of those who believed in Him and acted righteously: He will admit them into Gardens graced with flowing streams, there to remain for ever- the supreme triumph.",
    "But those who disbelieved and rejected Our signs will be the inhabitants of the Fire, there to remain- a miserable destination.",
    "Misfortunes can only happen with God’s permission––He will guide the heart of anyone who believes in Him: God knows all things––",
    "so obey God and the Messenger. If you turn away, remember that Our Messenger’s duty is only to make plain his message.",
    "God! There is no god but Him, so let the faithful put their trust in Him.",
    "Believers, even among your spouses and your children you have some enemies- beware of them- but if you overlook their offences, forgive them, pardon them, then God is all forgiving, all merciful.",
    "Your wealth and your children are only a test for you. There is great reward with God:",
    "be mindful of God as much as you can; hear and obey; be charitable- it is for your own good. Those who are saved from their own meanness will be the prosperous ones:",
    "if you make a generous loan to God He will multiply it for you and forgive you. God is ever thankful and forbearing;",
    "He knows the unseen, as well as the seen; He is the Almighty, the Wise."
