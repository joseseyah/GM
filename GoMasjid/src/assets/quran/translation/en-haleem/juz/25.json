    "Knowledge of the Hour belongs solely to Him and no crop comes out of its sheath, nor does any female conceive or give birth, without His knowledge. On the Day He asks them, ‘Where are My partners?’ they will answer, ‘We admit to You that none of us can see [them]’:",
    "the gods they invoked before will have vanished away; they will know that there is no escape.",
    "Man never tires of asking for good, but if evil touches him he loses all hope and becomes despondent.",
    "Whenever We let him taste some of Our mercy after he has been afflicted, he is sure to say, ‘This is all my own doing: I do not think the Hour will ever come, but even if I were to be taken back to my Lord, the best reward would await me with Him.’ We shall most certainly inform the disbelievers of what they have done and give them a taste of severe torment.",
    "Whenever We are gracious to man, he goes away haughtily, but, as soon as evil touches him, he turns to prolonged prayer.",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘Have you ever thought, what if this revelation really is from God and you still reject it? Who could be more astray than someone who cuts himself off so far [from God]?’",
    "We shall show them Our signs in every region of the earth and in themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that your Lord witnesses everything?",
    "Truly, they doubt that they will meet their Lord; truly He encompasses everything.",
    "Ha Mim",
    "Ayn Sin Qaf",
    "This is how God, the Mighty, the Wise, sends revelation to you [Prophet] as He did to those before you.",
    "All that is in the heavens and earth belongs to Him: He is the Exalted, the Almighty.",
    "The heavens are almost broken apart from above as the angels proclaim the praises of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. God is indeed the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful.",
    "As for those who take protectors other than Him, God is watching them; you are not responsible for them.",
    "So We have revealed an Arabic Quran to you, in order that you may warn the capital city and all who live nearby. And warn [especially] about the Day of Gathering, of which there is no doubt, when some shall be in the Garden and some in the blazing Flame.",
    "If God had so pleased, He could have made them a single community, but He admits to His mercy whoever He will; the evildoers will have no one to protect or help them.",
    "How can they take protectors other than Him? God alone is the Protector; He gives life to the dead; He has power over all things.",
    "Whatever you may differ about is for God to judge. [Say], ‘Such is God, my Lord. In Him I trust and to Him I turn,",
    "the Creator of the heavens and earth.’ He made mates for you from among yourselves––and for the animals too––so that you may multiply. There is nothing like Him: He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.",
    "The keys of the heavens and the earth are His; He provides abundantly or sparingly for whoever He will; He has full knowledge of all things.",
    "In matters of faith, He has laid down for you [people] the same commandment that He gave Noah, which We have revealed to you [Muhammad] and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus: ‘Uphold the faith and do not divide into factions within it’- what you [Prophet] call upon the idolaters to do is hard for them; God chooses whoever He pleases for Himself and guides towards Himself those who turn to Him.",
    "They divided, out of rivalry, only after knowledge had come to them, and, if it had not been for a decree already passed by your Lord to reprieve them until an appointed time, they would already have been judged. Those after them, who inherited the Scripture, are in disquieting doubt about it.",
    "So [Prophet] call people to that faith and follow the straight path as you have been commanded. Do not go by what they desire, but say, ‘I believe in whatever Scripture God has sent down. I am commanded to bring justice between you. God is our Lord and your Lord- to us our deeds and to you yours, so let there be no argument between us and you- God will gather us together, and to Him we shall return.’",
    "As for those who argue about God after He has been acknowledged, their argument has no weight with their Lord: anger will fall upon them and agonizing torment awaits them.",
    "It is God who has sent down the Scripture with Truth and the Balance. How can you tell? The Last Hour may well be near:",
    "those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, but the believers stand in awe of it. They know it to be the Truth; those who argue about the Hour are far, far astray.",
    "God is most subtle towards His creatures; He provides [bounti-fully] for whoever He will; He is the Powerful, the Almighty.",
    "If anyone desires a harvest in the life to come, We shall increase it for him; if anyone desires a harvest in this world, We shall give him a share of it, but in the Hereafter he will have no share.",
    "How can they believe in others who ordain for them things which God has not sanctioned in the practice of their faith? If it were not for God’s decree concerning the final Decision, judgement would already have been made between them. The evildoers will have a grievous punishment-",
    "you will see them fearful because of what they have done: punishment is bound to fall on them- but those who believe and do good deeds will be in the flowering meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish from their Lord: this is the great bounty;",
    "it is of this that God gives good news to His servants who believe and do good deeds. Say [Prophet], ‘I ask no reward from you for this, only the affection due to kin.’ If anyone does good, We shall increase it for him; God is most forgiving and most appreciative.",
    "How can they say, ‘He has invented a lie about God’? If God so willed, He could seal your heart and blot out lies: God confirms the Truth with His words. He has full knowledge of what is in the heart-",
    "it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons bad deeds- He knows everything you do.",
    "He responds to those who believe and do good deeds, and gives them more of His bounty; agonizing torment awaits the disbelievers.",
    "If God were to grant His plentiful provision to [all] His creatures, they would act insolently on earth, but He sends down in due measure whatever He will, for He is well aware of His servants and watchful over them:",
    "it is He who sends relief through rain after they have lost hope, and spreads His mercy far and wide. He is the Protector, Worthy of All Praise.",
    "Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and all the living creatures He has scattered throughout them: He has the power to gather them all together whenever He will.",
    "Whatever misfortune befalls you [people], it is because of what your own hands have done- God forgives much-",
    "you cannot escape Him anywhere on earth: you have no protector or helper other than God.",
    "Among His signs are the ships, sailing like floating mountains:",
    "if He willed, He could bring the wind to a standstill and they would lie motionless on the surface of the sea- there truly are signs in this for anyone who is steadfast and thankful-",
    "or He could cause them to be wrecked on account of what their passengers have done- God pardons much-",
    "to let those who argue about Our messages know that there is no escape for them.",
    "What you have been given is only the fleeting enjoyment of this world. Far better and more lasting is what God will give to those who believe and trust in their Lord;",
    "who shun great sins and gross indecencies; who forgive when they are angry;",
    "respond to their Lord; keep up the prayer; conduct their affairs by mutual consultation; give to others out of what We have provided for them;",
    "and defend themselves when they are oppressed.",
    "Let harm be requited by an equal harm, though anyone who forgives and puts things right will have his reward from God Himself––He does not like those who do wrong.",
    "There is no cause to act against anyone who defends himself after being wronged,",
    "but there is cause to act against those who oppress people and transgress in the land against all justice- they will have an agonizing torment-",
    "though if a person is patient and forgives, this is one of the greatest things.",
    "Anyone God allows to stray will have no one else to protect him: you [Prophet] will see the wrongdoers, when they face the punishment, exclaiming, ‘Is there any way of going back?’",
    "You will see them exposed to the Fire, abject in humiliation, glancing furtively, while those who believed exclaim, ‘The losers are the ones who have lost themselves and their people on the Day of Resurrection.’ Truly the evildoers will remain in lasting torment;",
    "they will have no allies to help them against God. There is no way [forward] for those God allows to stray.",
    "So [people] respond to your Lord before there comes a Day that cannot, against God’s will, be averted- you will have no refuge on that Day, and no possibility of denying [your sins].",
    "If they still turn away [remember that], We have not sent you [Prophet] to be their guardian: your only duty is to deliver the message. When We give man a taste of Our mercy, he rejoices in it, but if some harm befalls him on account of what he has done with his own hands, then he is ungrateful.",
    "God has control of the heavens and the earth; He creates whatever He will- He grants female offspring to whoever He will, male to whoever He will,",
    "Or both male and female, and He makes whoever He will barren: He is all knowing and all powerful.",
    "It is not granted to any mortal that God should speak to him except through revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by His command what He will: He is exalted and wise.",
    "So We have revealed a spirit to you [Prophet] by Our command: you knew neither the Scripture nor the faith, but We made it a light, guiding with it whoever We will of Our servants. You give guidance to the straight path,",
    "the path of God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth: truly everything will return to God.",
    "Ha Mim",
    "By the Scripture that makes things clear,",
    "We have made it a Quran in Arabic so that you [people] may understand.",
    "It is truly exalted in the Source of Scripture kept with Us, and full of wisdom.",
    "Should We ignore you and turn this revelation away from you because you are insolent people?",
    "We have sent many a prophet to earlier people",
    "and they mocked every one of them,",
    "so We have destroyed mightier people than [the disbelievers of Mecca] and their example has gone down in history.",
    "If you [Prophet] ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and earth?’ they are sure to say, ‘They were created by the Almighty, the All Knowing.’",
    "It is He who smoothed out the earth for you and traced out routes on it for you to find your way,",
    "who sends water down from the sky in due measure––We resurrect dead land with it, and likewise you will be resurrected from the grave––",
    "who created every kind of thing, who gave you ships and animals to ride on",
    "so that you may remember your Lord’s grace when you are seated on them and say, ‘Glory be to Him who has given us control over this; we could not have done it by ourselves.",
    "Truly it is to our Lord that we are returning.’",
    "Yet they assign some of His own servants to Him as offspring!Man is clearly ungrateful!",
    "Has He taken daughters for Himself and favoured you with sons?",
    "When one of them is given news of the birth of a daughter, such as he so readily ascribes to the Lord of Mercy, his face grows dark and he is filled with gloom-",
    "‘Someone who is brought up amongst trinkets, who cannot put together a clear argument?’",
    "They consider the angels- God’s servants- to be female. Did they witness their creation? Their claim will be put on record and they will be questioned about it.",
    "They say, ‘If the Lord of Mercy had willed it, we would not have worshipped them,’ but they do not know that- they are only guessing-",
    "or have We perhaps given them a book before this one, to which they hold fast?",
    "No indeed! They say, ‘We saw our fathers following this tradition; we are guided by their footsteps.’",
    "When-ever We sent a messenger before you to warn a township, those corrupted by wealth said, in the same way, ‘We saw our fathers following this tradition; we are only following in their footsteps.’",
    "The messenger said, ‘Even though I bring you a truer religion than what you saw your fathers following?’ and they replied, ‘But we do not believe the message you bring.’",
    "We punished them: think about how those who rejected the Truth met their end.",
    "Abraham said to his father and his people, ‘I renounce what you worship.",
    "I worship only Him who created me, and it is He who will guide me,’",
    "and he bequeathed these words to his descendants so that they might return [to God].",
    "I have let these people and their fathers enjoy long lives, and now I have given them the Truth and a messenger to make things clear-",
    "yet when the Truth came to them, they said, ‘This is sorcery. We do not believe in it,’",
    "and they said, ‘Why was this Quran not sent down to a distinguished man, from either of the two cities?’",
    "Are they the ones who share out your Lord’s grace? We are the ones who give them their share of livelihood in this world and We have raised some of them above others in rank, so that some may take others into service: your Lord’s grace is better than anything they accumulate.",
    "If it were not that all mankind might have become a single nation [of disbelievers], We could have given all those who disbelieve in the Lord of Mercy houses with roofs of silver, sweeping staircases to ascend,",
    "massive gates, couches to sit on,",
    "and golden ornaments. All of these are mere enjoyments of this life; your Lord reserves the next life for those who take heed of Him.",
    "We assign an evil one as a comrade for whoever turns away from the revelations of the Lord of Mercy:",
    "evil ones bar people from the right path, even though they may think they are well guided.",
    "When such a person comes to Us, he will say [to his comrade], ‘If only you had been as far away from me as east is from west. What an evil comrade!’",
    "[It will be said to them], ‘You have done wrong. Having partners in punishment will not console you today.’",
    "Can you [Prophet] make the deaf hear? Or guide either the blind or those who are in gross error?",
    "Either We shall take you away and punish them- indeed We will-",
    "or We shall let you witness the punishment We threatened them with; We have full power over them.",
    "Hold fast to what has been revealed to you- you truly are on the right path-",
    "for it is a reminder for you and your people: you will all be questioned.",
    "Ask the prophets We sent before you: ‘Did We ever appoint any gods to be worshipped besides the Lord of Mercy?’",
    "We sent Moses to Pharaoh and his courtiers and he said, ‘I am truly a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds,’",
    "but when he presented Our signs to them, they laughed,",
    "even though each sign We showed them was greater than the previous one. We inflicted torment on them so that they might return to the right path.",
    "They said, ‘Sorcerer, call on your Lord for us, by virtue of His pledge to you: we shall certainly accept guidance,’",
    "but as soon as We relieved their torment they broke their word.",
    "Pharaoh proclaimed to his people, ‘My people, is the Kingdom of Egypt not mine? And these rivers that flow at my feet, are they not mine? Do you not see?",
    "Am I not better than this contemptible wretch who can scarcely express himself?",
    "Why has he not been given any gold bracelets? Why have no angels come to accompany him?’",
    "In this way he moved his people to accept and they obeyed him- they were perverse people.",
    "When they provoked Us, We punished and drowned them all:",
    "We made them a lesson and an example for later people.",
    "When the son of Mary is cited as an example, your people [Prophet] laugh and jeer,",
    "saying, ‘Are our gods better or him?’- they cite him only to challenge you: they are a contentious people-",
    "but he is only a servant We favoured and made an example for the Children of Israel:",
    "if it had been Our will, We could have made you angels, succeeding one another on earth.",
    "This [Quran] gives knowledge of the Hour: do not doubt it. Follow Me for this is the right path;",
    "do not let Satan hinder you, for he is your sworn enemy.",
    "When Jesus came with clear signs he said, ‘I have brought you wisdom; I have come to clear up some of your differences for you. Be mindful of God and obey me:",
    "God is my Lord and your Lord. Serve Him: this is the straight path.’",
    "Yet still the different factions among them disagreed- woe to the evildoers: they will suffer the torment of a grievous day!-",
    "what are they waiting for but the Hour, which will come upon them suddenly and take them unawares?",
    "On that Day, friends will become each other’s enemies. Not so the righteous-",
    "‘My servants, there is no fear for you today, nor shall you grieve’––",
    "those who believed in Our revelations and devoted themselves to Us.",
    "‘Enter Paradise, you and your spouses: you will be filled with joy.’",
    "Dishes and goblets of gold will be passed around them with all that their souls desire and their eyes delight in. ‘There you will remain:",
    "this is the Garden you are given as your own, because of what you used to do,",
    "and there is abundant fruit in it for you to eat.’",
    "But the evildoers will remain in Hell’s punishment,",
    "from which there is no relief: they will remain in utter despair.",
    "We never wronged them; they were the ones who did wrong.",
    "They will cry, ‘Malik, if only your Lord would finish us off,’ but he will answer, ‘No! You are here to stay.’",
    "We have brought you the Truth but most of you despise it.",
    "Have these disbelievers thought up some scheme? We too have been scheming.",
    "Do they think We cannot hear their secret talk and their private counsel? Yes we can: Our messengers are at their sides, recording everything.",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘If the Lord of Mercy [truly] had offspring I would be the first to worship [them], but-",
    "exalted be the Lord of the heavens and earth, the Lord of the Throne- He is far above their false descriptions.’",
    "Leave them to wade in deeper and play about, until they face the Day they have been promised.",
    "It is He who is God in heaven and God on earth; He is the All Wise, the All Knowing;",
    "Exalted is He who has control of the heavens and earth and everything between them; He has knowledge of the Hour; you will all be returned to Him.",
    "Those gods they invoke besides Him have no power of intercession, unlike those who bore witness to the truth and recognized it.",
    "If you [Prophet] ask them who created them they are sure to say, ‘God,’ so why are they so deluded?",
    "The Prophet has said, ‘My Lord, truly these are people who do not believe,’",
    "but turn away from them and say, ‘Peace’: they will come to know.",
    "Ha Mim",
    "By the Scripture that makes things clear,",
    "truly We sent it down on a blessed night––We have always sent warnings––",
    "a night when every matter of wisdom was made distinct",
    "at Our command––We have always sent messages to man––",
    "as a mercy [Prophet] from your Lord who sees and knows all,",
    "Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between––if only you people were firm believers––",
    "there is no god but Him: He gives life and death––He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers––",
    "yet in [their state of] doubt they take nothing seriously.",
    "[Prophet], watch out for the Day when the sky brings forth clouds of smoke for all to see.",
    "It will envelop the people. They will cry, ‘This is a terrible torment!",
    "Lord relieve us from this torment! We believe!’",
    "How will this [sudden] faith benefit them? When a prophet came to warn them plainly,",
    "they turned their backs on him, saying, ‘He is tutored! He is possessed!’",
    "We shall hold the torment back for a while ––you are sure to return [to Us]––",
    "and on the Day We seize [them] mightily We shall exact retribution.",
    "We tested the people of Pharaoh before them: a noble messenger was sent to them,",
    "saying, ‘Hand the servants of God over to me! I am a faithful messenger who has been sent to you.",
    "Do not consider yourselves to be above God! I come to you with clear authority.",
    "I seek refuge in my Lord and yours against your insults!",
    "If you do not believe me, just let me be.’",
    "[Moses] cried to his Lord, ‘These people are evildoers!’",
    "[God replied], ‘Escape in the night with My servants, for you are sure to be pursued.",
    "Leave the sea behind you parted and their army will be drowned.’",
    "Many a garden and spring they left behind,",
    "many a cornfield and noble building,",
    "many a thing in which they had delighted:",
    "We gave these to another people to inherit.",
    "Neither heavens nor earth shed a tear for them, nor were they given any time.",
    "We saved the Children of Israel from their degrading suffering",
    "at the hands of Pharaoh: he was a tyrant who exceeded all bounds.",
    "We chose them knowingly above others:",
    "We gave them revelations in which there was a clear test.",
    "These people here assert,",
    "‘There is nothing beyond our one death: we will not be resurrected.",
    "Bring back our forefathers, if what you say is true.’",
    "Are they better than the people of Tubba and those who flourished before them? We destroyed them all- they were guilty.",
    "We were not playing a pointless game when We created the heavens and earth and everything in between;",
    "We created them for a true purpose, but most people do not comprehend.",
    "The Day of Decision is the time appointed for all;",
    "a Day when no friend can take another’s place.",
    "No one will receive any help except for those to whom God shows mercy: He is the Mighty, the Merciful Lord.",
    "The tree of Zaqqum",
    "will be food for the sinners:",
    "[hot] as molten metal, it boils in their bellies",
    "like seething water.",
    "‘Take him! Thrust him into the depths of Hell!",
    "Pour scalding water over his head as punishment!’",
    "‘Taste this, you powerful, respected man!",
    "This is what you doubted.’",
    "But those mindful of God will be in a safe place",
    "amid Gardens and springs,",
    "clothed in silk and fine brocade, facing one another:",
    "so it will be. We shall wed them to maidens with large, dark eyes.",
    "Secure and contented, they will call for every kind of fruit.",
    "After the one death they will taste death no more. God will guard them from the torment of Hell,",
    "a bounty from your Lord. That is the supreme triumph.",
    "We have made this Quran easy to understand- in your own language [Prophet]- so that they may take heed.",
    "So wait; the disbelievers too are waiting.",
    "Ha Mim",
    "This Scripture is sent down from God, the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "There are signs in the heavens and the earth for those who believe:",
    "in the creation of you, in the creatures God scattered on earth, there are signs for people of sure faith;",
    "in the alternation of night and day, in the rain God provides, sending it down from the sky and reviving the dead earth with it, and in His shifting of the winds there are signs for those who use their reason.",
    "These are God’s signs that We recount to you [Prophet, to show] the Truth. If they deny God and His revelations, what message will they believe in?",
    "Woe to every lying sinful person",
    "who hears God’s revelations being recited to him, yet persists in his arrogance as if he had never heard them––[Prophet] bring him news of a painful torment!––",
    "who, if he knows anything about Our revelations, ridicules it! Such people will have a humiliating torment:",
    "Hell lurks behind them and their gains will not benefit them, nor will those beings they took as protectors beside God––a tremendous torment awaits them.",
    "This is true guidance; those who reject their Lord’s revelations will have a woeful torment.",
    "It is God who subjected the sea for you––ships sail on it by His command so that you can seek His bounty and give Him thanks––",
    "He has subjected all that is in the heavens and the earth for your benefit, as a gift from Him. There truly are signs in this for those who reflect.",
    "Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear God’s days [of punishment]––He will requite people for what they have done.",
    "Whoever does good benefits himself, and whoever does evil harms himself: you will all be returned to your Lord.",
    "We gave scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to the Children of Israel; We provided them with good things and favoured them above others;",
    "We gave them clear proof in matters [of religion]. They differed among themselves out of mutual rivalry, only after knowledge came to them: on the Day of Resurrection your Lord will judge between them regarding their differences.",
    "Now We have set you [Muhammad] on a clear religious path, so follow it. Do not follow the desires of those who lack [true] knowledge-",
    "they cannot help you against God in any way. Wrongdoers only have each other to protect them; the righteous have God Himself as their protector.",
    "This [revelation] is a means of insight for people, a source of guidance and mercy for those of sure faith.",
    "Do those who commit evil deeds really think that We will deal with them in the same way as those who believe and do righteous deeds, that they will be alike in their living and their dying? How badly they judge!",
    "God created the heavens and earth for a true purpose: to reward each soul according to its deeds. They will not be wronged.",
    "[Prophet], consider the one who has taken his own desire as a god, whom God allows to stray in the face of knowledge, sealing his ears and heart and covering his eyes- who can guide such a person after God [has done this]? Will you [people] not take heed?",
    "They say, ‘There is only our life in this world: we die, we live, nothing but time destroys us.’ They have no knowledge of this; they only follow guesswork. Their only argument,",
    "when Our clear revelations are recited to them, is to say, ‘Bring back our forefathers if what you say is true.’",
    "[Prophet], say, ‘It is God who gives you life, then causes you to die, and then He gathers you all to the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt, though most people do not comprehend.’",
    "Control of everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to God. When the Hour comes, those who follow falsehood will be the losers on that Day.",
    "You will see every community kneeling. Every community will be summoned to its record: ‘Today you will be repaid for what you did.",
    "Here is Our record that tells the truth about you: We have been recording everything you do.’",
    "Those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted by their Lord into His mercy- that is the clearest triumph-",
    "but those who disbelieved [will be asked]: ‘When My revelations were recited to you, were you not arrogant and persistent in wicked deeds?",
    "When it was said to you, “God’s promise is true: there is no doubt about the Hour,” did you not reply, “We know nothing of the Hour. This is only conjecture in our opinion. We are not convinced”?’",
    "The evil of their actions will [then] become clear to them. The punishment they mocked will engulf them.",
    "It will be said, ‘Today We shall ignore you just as you ignored your appointment with this Day. The Fire will be your home and no one will help you,",
    "because you received God’s revelations with ridicule and were deceived by worldly life.’ They will not be brought out of the Fire on that Day, nor will they be given the chance to make amends.",
    "So praise be to God, Lord of the heavens and earth, Lord of the worlds.",
    "True greatness in the heavens and the earth is rightfully His: He is the Mighty, the Wise."
