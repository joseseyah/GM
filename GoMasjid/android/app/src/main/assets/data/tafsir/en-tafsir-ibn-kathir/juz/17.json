    "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surat Al-Anbiya'</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid said that `Abdullah said, \"Banu Isra'il, Al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta Ha and Al-Anbiya' - they are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasure.\"</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Hour is at hand but People are heedless</h2><p>This is a warning from Allah of the approach of the Hour, and that people are heedless of it, i.e., they are not working for it or preparing for it. An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu Sa`id reported from the Prophet :</p><p>فِى غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(while they turn away in heedlessness), he said,</p><p>«فِي الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(in this world.) Allah says:</p><p>أَتَى أَمْرُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ</p><p>(The Event ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it)</p><p>اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَانشَقَّ الْقَمَرُ وَإِن يَرَوْاْ ءَايَةً يُعْرِضُواْ</p><p>(The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away.) 54:1,2. Then Allah states that they do not listen to the revelation (Wahy) that He sends down to His Messenger , which is addressed to the Quraysh and all disbelievers like them.</p><p>مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ مُّحْدَثٍ</p><p>(Comes not unto them an admonition from their Lord as a recent revelation) meaning, newly-revealed,</p><p>إِلاَّ اسْتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(but they listen to it while they play. ) This is like what Ibn `Abbas said, \"Why do you ask the People of the Book about what they have, which has been altered and distorted, and they have added things and taken things away, when your Book is the most recently revealed from Allah, and you read it pure and unadulterated\" Al-Bukhari recorded something similar to this.</p><p>وَأَسَرُّواْ النَّجْوَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ</p><p>(Those who do wrong, conceal their private counsels) meaning, what they say to one another in secret.</p><p>هَلْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ</p><p>(Is this more than a human being like you) meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They did not believe that he could be a Prophet because he was a human being like them, so how could he have been singled out to receive revelation, and not them They said:</p><p>أَفَتَأْتُونَ السِّحْرَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(Will you submit to magic while you see it) meaning, will you follow him and be like one who submits to magic when he knows that it is magic Allah said in response to their fabrications and lies:</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّى يَعْلَمُ الْقَوْلَ فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(He said: \"My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and on earth...\") Nothing at all is hidden from the One Who knows that, and He is the One Who reveals this Qur'an which contains news of the earliest and last generations. No one can produce the like of this except the One Who knows all the secrets of the heavens and the earth.</p><p>وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) means, He hears all that they say and He knows all their circumstances. This is a warning and a threat to them.</p><h2>The Disbelievers' Ideas about the Qur'an and the Messenger ; their demand for a Sign and the Refutation of that</h2><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ أَضْغَـثُ أَحْلاَمٍ بَلِ افْتَرَاهُ</p><p>(Nay, they say: \"These are mixed up false dreams! Nay, he has invented it!...\") Here Allah tells us of the stubbornness and heresy of the disblievers, and the various things they said about the Qur'an, and how they were confused and misguided about it. Sometimes they described it as magic, and sometimes they described it as poetry, or mixed up false dreams, or a fabrication. As Allah says:</p><p>انْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ الاٌّمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(See what examples they have put forward for you. So they have gone astray, and never can they find a way) 17:48</p><p>فَلْيَأْتِنَا بِـَايَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ الاٌّوَّلُونَ</p><p>(Let him then bring us an Ayah like the ones that were sent before!) They were referring to the she-camel of Salih, and the signs of Musa and `Isa. And Allah says,</p><p>وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالاٌّيَـتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ</p><p>(And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them.) 17:59. So Allah said here:</p><p>مَآ ءَامَنَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَآ أَفَهُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(Not one of the towns of those which We destroyed, believed before them; will they then believe) None of the peoples to whom Messengers were sent were given a sign at the hands of their Prophet and believed. On the contrary, they disbelieved and We destroyed them as a result. Would these people believe in a sign if they saw it Not at all! In fact,</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:96-97. Indeed, they witnes- sed clear signs and definitive proof at the hands of the Messen- ger of Allah , signs which were far clearer and more overwhel- ming than any that had been witnessed in the case of any other Prophet, may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all.</p>",

Then He caused rain to fall from the sky and vegetation to grow from the earth. He says:</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ حَىٍّ أَفَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe) meaning, they see with their own eyes how creation develops step by step. All of that is proof of the existence of the Creator Who is in control of all things and is able to do whatever He wills.</p><h2>In everything there is a Sign of Him, showing that He is One</h2><p>Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from his father from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas was asked; \"Did the night come first or the day\" He said, \"Do you think that when the heavens and the earth were joined together, there was anything between them except darkness Thus you may know that the night came before the day. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Umar said that a man came to him and questioned him about when the heavens and earth were joined together then they were parted. He said, \"Go to that old man (Shaykh) and ask him, then come and tell me what he says to you.\" So he went to Ibn `Abbas and asked him. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Yes, the heavens were joined together and it did not rain, and the earth was joined together and nothing grew. When living beings were created to populate the earth, rain came forth from the heavens and vegetation came forth from the earth.\" The man went back to Ibn `Umar and told him what had been said. Ibn `Umar said, \"Now I know that Ibn `Abbas has been given knowledge of the Qur'an. He has spoken the truth, and this is how it was.\" Ibn `Umar said: \"I did not like the daring attitude of Ibn `Abbas in his Tafsir of the Qur'an, but now I know that he has been given knowledge of the Qur'an.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"The heavens and the earth were attached to one another, then when the heavens were raised up, the earth became separate from them, and this is their parting which was mentioned by Allah in His Book.\" Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"They were joined together, then they were separated by this air.\"</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ حَىٍّ</p><p>(And We have made from water every living thing. ) meaning, the origin of every living thing is in water. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"I said: O Messenger of Allah, when I see you I feel happy and content, tell me about everything.\" He said,</p><p>«كُلُّ شَيْءٍ خُلِقَ مِنْ مَاء»</p><p>(Everything was created from water.) \"I said, tell me about something which, if I do it, I will enter Paradise.\" He said:</p><p>«أَفْشِ السَّلَامَ، وَأَطْعِمِ الطَّعَامَ، وَصِلِ الْأَرْحَامَ، وَقُمْ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّاسُ نِيَامٌ، ثُمَّ ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّةَ بِسَلَام»</p><p>(Spread (the greeting of) Salam, feed others, uphold the ties of kinship, and stand in prayer at night when people are sleeping. Then you will enter Paradise in peace.) This chain of narration fulfills the conditions of the Two Sahihs, apart from Abu Maymunah, who is one of the men of the Sunans, his first name was Salim; and At-Tirmidhi classed him as Sahih.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ رَوَاسِىَ</p><p>(And We have placed on the earth firm mountains,) means, mountains which stabilize the earth and keep it steady and lend it weight, lest it should shake with the people, i.e., move and tremble so that they would not be able to stand firm on it -- because it is covered with water, apart from one-quarter of its surface. So the land is exposed to the air and sun, so that its people may see the sky with its dazzling signs and evidence. So Allah says,</p><p>أَن تَمِيدَ بِهِمْ</p><p>(lest it should shake with them, ) meaning, so that it will not shake with them.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً</p><p>(and We placed therein broad highways for them to pass through,) means, mountain passes through which they may travel from region to region, country to country. As we can see, the mountains form barriers between one land and another, so Allah created gaps -- passes -- in the mountains so that people may travel from here to there.

Then Allah says, drawing attention to some of His signs,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَـرَ</p><p>(And He it is Who has created the night and the day,) meaning, the one with its darkness and stillness, and the other with its light and human interaction; sometimes the one is longer while the other is shorter, then they switch.</p><p>وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ</p><p>(and the sun and the moon,) the sun with its own light and its own path and orbit and allotted time, and the moon which shines with a different light and travels on a different path and has its own allotted time.</p><p>كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ</p><p>(each in an orbit floating.) means, revolving.

    "<h2>The Signs of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth and in the Night and the Day</h2><p>Here Allah tells of His perfect might and power in His creation and subjugation of all things.</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(Have not those who disbelieve known) means, those who deny His Divine nature and worship others instead of Him, do they not realize that Allah is the One Who is Independent in His powers of creation and is running the affairs of all things with absolute power So how can it be appropriate to worship anything else beside Him or to associate others in worship with Him Do they not see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, i.e. in the beginning they were all one piece, attached to one another and piled up on top of one another, then He separated them from one another, and made the heavens seven and the earth seven, placing the air between the earth and the lowest heaven. Then He caused rain to fall from the sky and vegetation to grow from the earth. He says:</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ حَىٍّ أَفَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And We have made from water every living thing.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Umar said that a man came to him and questioned him about when the heavens and earth were joined together then they were parted.

Ibn `Umar said, \"Now I know that Ibn `Abbas has been given knowledge of the Qur'an.

So the land is exposed to the air and sun, so that its people may see the sky with its dazzling signs and evidence.

Then Allah says, drawing attention to some of His signs,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَـرَ</p><p>(And He it is Who has created the night and the day,) meaning, the one with its darkness and stillness, and the other with its light and human interaction; sometimes the one is longer while the other is shorter, then they switch.</p><p>وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ</p><p>(and the sun and the moon,) the sun with its own light and its own path and orbit and allotted time, and the moon which shines with a different light and travels on a different path and has its own allotted time.</p><p>كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ</p><p>(each in an orbit floating.) means, revolving. Ibn `Abbas said, \"They revolve like a spinning wheel, in a circle.\" This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak.

    "<h2>How the Idolators are deceived by their long and luxurious Lives in this World, and the Explanation of the Truth</h2><p>Allah explains that they have been deceived and misled by the luxuries that they enjoy in this world and the long life that they have been given, so they believe that they are following something good. Then Allah warns them:</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِى الاٌّرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَآ</p><p>(See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ الْقُرَى وَصَرَّفْنَا الاٌّيَـتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(And indeed We have destroyed towns round about you, and We have shown the Ayat in various ways that they might return.) 46:27 Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: \"This means the victory of Islam over disbelief.\" The meaning is: Do they not learn a lesson from the fact that Allah supported those (believers) against their enemies, He destroyed the disbelieving nations and the evil-doing townships, and He saved His believing servants So Allah says:</p><p>أَفَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ</p><p>(Is it then they who will overcome) meaning, on the contrary, they are the ones who will be overcomed, who will be defeated, humiliated and brought low.</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُنذِرُكُم بِالْوَحْىِ</p><p>(Say: \"I warn you only by the revelation.\") meaning, `I only convey to you the warning of Allah's punishment and vengeance, and this is no more than that which Allah reveals to me.' But this is of no benefit to the one whom Allah has made blind and has put a seal over his hearing and his heart. He says:</p><p>وَلاَ يَسْمَعُ الصُّمُّ الدُّعَآءَ إِذَا مَا يُنذَرُونَ</p><p>(But the deaf will not hear the call, (even) when they are warned.)</p><p>وَلَئِن مَّسَّتْهُمْ نَفْحَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ يويْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And if a breath of the torment of your Lord touches them, they will surely, cry: \"Woe unto us! Indeed we have been wrongdoers!\") If these disbelievers were affected by the slightest touch of Allah's punishment, they would confess their sins and admit that they had wronged themselves in this world.</p><p>وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَزِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً</p><p>(And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything.) meaning, \"We shall set up the Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection.\" The majority of scholars state that it is one Balance, and the plural form is used here to reflect the large number of deeds which will be weighed therein.</p><p>فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَى بِنَا حَـسِبِينَ</p><p>(then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And sufficient are We to take account.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</p><p>(and your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) 4:40</p><p>يبُنَىَّ إِنَّهَآ إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ فَتَكُنْ فِى صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ أَوْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا اللَّهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(\"O my son! If it be equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Verily, Allah is Subtle, Well-Aware.\") 31:16 In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ: سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ الْعَظِيم»</p><p>(Two words which are light on the tongue, heavy in the Balance and beloved to Ar-Rahman: \"Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdihi, Subhan Allahil `Azim (Glory and praise be to Allah, Glory be to Allah the Almighty).\") Imam Ahmad also recorded that `A'ishah said that one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down before him and said, \"O Messenger of Allah, I have two slaves who lie to me, betray me and disobey me, and I hit them and insult them. How do I stand with regard to them\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يُحْسَبُ مَا خَانُوكَ وَعَصَوْكَ وَكَذَّبُوكَ وَعِقَابُكَ إِيَّاهُمْ، فَإِنْ كَانَ عِقَابُكَ إِيَّاهُمْ بِقَدْرِ ذُنُوبِهِمْ، كَانَ كَفَافًا لَا لَكَ وَلَا عَلَيْكَ، وَإِنْ كَانَ عِقَابُكَ إِيَّاهُمْ دُونَ ذُنُوبِهِمْ، كَانَ فَضْلًا لَكَ، وَإِنْ كَانَ عِقَابُكَ إِيَّاهُمْ فَوْقَ ذُنُوبِهِمْ، اقْتُصَّ لَهُمْ مِنْكَ الْفَضْلُ الَّذِي بَقِيَ قَبْلَك»</p><p>(The extent to which they betrayed you, disobeyed you and lied to you will be measured against the punishment you meted out to them. If your punishment was commensurate with their misconduct, then you will be equal and you will not have anything counted for you or against you. If your punishment of them was less than that what they deserved for their misconduct, then this will count in your favor. If your punishment of them was more than what they deserved for their misconduct, then Allah will take what is due to them from you.) Then the man started to weep before the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked,</p><p>«مَالَهُ لَا يَقْرَأُ كِتَابَ الله</p><p>وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَزِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَى بِنَا حَـسِبِينَ »</p><p>(What is the matter with him Has he not read the words of Allah, (And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything.

This continued three times, and each time he said the same as he had said the first time. Then he called the closest of his guards and said, \"You have not brought me a human being, you have brought me a devil! Take her out and give her Hajar.

Qatadah said: \"The people admitted their guilt and confusion, and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَـؤُلاءِ يَنطِقُونَ</div><p>(\"Indeed you know well that these speak not!\") `So how can you tell us to ask them, if they cannot speak and you know that they cannot speak' At this point, when they admitted that, Ibrahim said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ</div><p>(Do you then worship besides Allah, things that can neither profit you nor harm you) meaning, if they can- not speak and they can neither benefit you nor harm you, then why do you worship them instead of Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُفٍّ لَّكُمْ وَلِمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Fie upon you, and upon that which you worship besides Allah! Have you then no sense) `Do you not realize the extent of the mis- guidance and extreme disbelief which you are following, which no one could accept but one who is an igno- rant and evil wrong- doer' He defeated them in argument and left them with no way out. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَـهَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ</div><p>e(And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people) 6:83</p>",
    "<h2>How Ibrahim was thrown into the Fire and how Allah controlled it</h2><p>When their arguments were refuted and their incapability became clear, when truth was made manifest and falsehood was defeated, they resorted to using their power and strength, and said:</p><p>حَرِّقُوهُ وَانصُرُواْ ءَالِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ</p><p>(\"Burn him and help your gods, if you will be doing.\") So they gathered together a huge amount of wood. As-Suddi said, \"I if a woman was sick, she would make a vow that if she recovered she would bring wood to burn Ibrahim. Then they made a hole in the ground and set it aflame, and it burned with huge sparks and immense flames. There had never been a fire like it. They put Ibrahim, peace be upon him, into a catapult, at the suggestion of a nomadic Kurdish man from Persia.\" Shu`ayb Al-Jaba'i said, \"His name was Hayzan, and Allah caused the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking into it until the Day of Resurrection. When they threw him he said, `Sufficient for me is Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs.' \" This is similar to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that Ibrahim said, \"`Sufficient for me is Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs,\" when he was thrown into the fire, and Muhammad ﷺ said it when they said:</p><p>إِنَّ النَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُواْ لَكُمْ فَاخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَقَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ</p><p>(Verily, the people have gathered against you, therefore, fear them. But it increased them in faith, and they said: \"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\") 3:173. Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"When Ibrahim was thrown into the fire, the keeper (angel) of the rain said: `When will I be commanded to send rain' But the command of Allah was more swift. Allah said:</p><p>ينَارُ كُونِى بَرْداً وَسَلَـمَا عَلَى إِبْرَهِيمَ</p><p>(O fire! Be you cool and safety for Ibrahim!), and there was no fire left on earth that was not extinguished.\" Ibn `Abbas and Abu Al-`Aliyah said: \"Were it not for the fact that Allah said,</p><p>وَسَلَـماً</p><p>(and safety), Ibrahim would have been harmed by its coldness.\" Qatadah said: \"On that day there was no creature that did not try to extinguish the fire for Ibrahim, except for the gecko.\" Az-Zuhri said: \"The Prophet commanded that it should be killed, and called it a harmful vermin.\"</p><p>وَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَـهُمُ الاٌّخْسَرِينَ</p><p>(And they wanted to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.) they were defeated and humiliated, because they wanted to plot against the Prophet of Allah, but Allah planned against them and saved him from the fire, and thus they were defeated.</p>",

He (Ibrahim) said: \"I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord\") 29:26. Allah gave him wisdom and knowledge; He sent Revelation to him, made him a Prophet and appointed him to Sadum (Sodom) and its vicinity, but they rejected him and resisted him, so Allah utterly destroyed them, as He tells us in several places in His Book. Allah says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلُوطاً آتَيْنَـهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِى كَانَت تَّعْمَلُ الْخَبَـئِثَ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَـسِقِينَ - وَأَدْخَلْنَـهُ فِى رَحْمَتِنَآ إِنَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>(and We saved him from the town who practised Al-Khaba'ith. Verily, they were a people given to evil, and were rebellious. And We admitted him to Our mercy; truly, he was of the righteous.)</p>",

    "<h2>Dawud and Sulayman and the Signs which They were given; the Story of the People whose Sheep pastured at Night in the Field</h2><p>Abu Ishaq narrated from Murrah from Ibn Mas`ud: \"That crop was grapes, bunches of which were dangling.\" This was also the view of Shurayh. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Nafash means grazing.\" Shurayh, Az-Zuhri and Qatadah said: \"Nafash only happens at night.\" Qatadah added, \"and Al-Haml is grazing during the day.\"</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night;) Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said: \"Grapes which had grown and their bunches were spoiled by the sheep. Dawud (David) ruled that the owner of the grapes should keep the sheep. Sulayman (Solomon) said, `Not like this, O Prophet of Allah!' Dawud said, `How then' Sulayman said: `Give the grapes to the owner of the sheep and let him tend them until they grow back as they were, and give the sheep to the owner of the grapes and let him benefit from them until the grapes have grown back as they were. Then the grapes should be given back to their owner, and the sheep should be given back to their owner.' This is what Allah said:</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case).)\" This was also reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas.</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ وَكُلاًّ ءَاتَيْنَا حُكْماً وَعِلْماً</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case); and to each of them We gave wisdom and knowledge.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when Iyas bin Mu`awiyah was appointed as a judge, Al-Hasan came to him and found Iyas weeping. Al-Hasan said, \"Why are you weeping\" Iyas said, \"O Abu Sa`id, What I heard about judges among them a judge is he, who studies a case and his judgment is wrong, so he will go to Hell; another judge is he who is biased because of his own whims and desires, so he will go to Hell; and the other judge he who studies a case and gives the right judgement, so he will go to Paradise.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basari said: \"But what Allah tells us about Dawud and Sulayman (peace be upon them both) and the Prophets and whatever judgements they made proves that what these people said is wrong. Allah says:</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَـهِدِينَ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night; and We were witness to their judgement.) Allah praised Sulayman but He did not condemn Dawud.\" Then he -- Al-Hasan -- said, \"Allah enjoins three things upon the judges: not to sell thereby for some miserable price; not to follow their own whims and desires; and not to fear anyone concerning their judgements. \" Then he recited:</p><p>يدَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـكَ خَلِيفَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعِ الْهَوَى فَيُضِلَّكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(O Dawud!

With regard to others, it is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari from `Amir bin Al-`As that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا اجْتَهَدَ الْحَاكِمُ فَأَصَابَ، فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَإِذَا اجْتَهَدَ فَأَخْطَأَ، فَلَهُ أَجْر»</p><p>(If the judge does his best, studies the case and reaches the right conclusion, he will have two rewards. If he does his best, studies the case and reaches the wrong conclusion, he will have one reward.) This Hadith refutes the idea of Iyas, who thought that if he did his best, studied the case and reached the wrong conclusion, he would go to Hell. And Allah knows best. Similar to story in the Qur'an is the report recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«بَيْنَمَا امْرَأَتَانِ مَعَهُمَا ابْنَانِ لَهُمَا، إِذْ جَاءَ الذِّئْبُ فَأَخَذَ أَحَدَ الْابْنَيْنِ فَتَحَاكَمَتَا إِلَىىَداوُدَ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلْكُبْرَى، فَخَرَجَتَا فَدَعَاهُمَا سُلَيْمَانُ فَقَالَ: هَاتُوا السِّكِّينَ أَشُقُّهُ بَيْنَكُمَا: فَقَالَتِ الصُّغْرَى: يَرْحَمُكَ اللهُ هُوَ ابْنُهَا لَا تَشُقَّهُ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلصُّغْرَى»</p><p>(There were two women who each had a son. The wolf came and took one of the children, and they referred their dispute to Dawud. He ruled that the (remaining) child belonged to the older woman. They left, then Sulayman called them and said, \"Give me a sword and I will divide him between the two of you.\" The younger woman said, \"May Allah have mercy on you! He is her child, do not cut him up!\" So he ruled that the child belonged to the younger woman). This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs. An-Nasa'i also devoted a chapter to this in the Book of Judgements.</p><p>وَسَخَّرْنَا مَعَ دَاوُودَ الْجِبَالَ يُسَبِّحْنَ وَالطَّيْرَ</p><p>(And We subjected the mountains and the birds to glorify Our praises along with Dawud.) This refers to the beauty of his voice when he recited his Book, Az-Zabur. When he recited it in a beautiful manner, the birds would stop and hover in the air, and would repeat after him, and the mountains would respond and echo his words. The Prophet passed by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari while he was reciting Qur'an at night, and he had a very beautiful voice, he stopped and listened to his recitation, and said:</p><p>«لَقَدْ أُوتِيَ هَذَا مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُد»</p><p>(This man has been given one of the wind instruments (nice voices) of the family of Dawud.) He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, if I had known that you were listening, I would have done my best for you.\"</p><p>وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ صَنْعَةَ لَبُوسٍ لَّكُمْ لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ</p><p>(And We taught him the making of metal coats of mail, to protect you in your fighting.) meaning, the manufacture of chain-armor. Qatadah said that before that, they used to wear plated armor; he was the first one to make rings of chain-armor. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَأَلَنَّا لَهُ الْحَدِيدَأَنِ اعْمَلْ سَـبِغَـتٍ وَقَدِّرْ فِى السَّرْدِ</p><p>(And We made the iron soft for him. Saying: \"Make you perfect coats of mail, and balance well the rings of chain armor.\") 34:10-11, meaning, do not make the pegs so loose that the rings (of chain mail) will shake, or make it so tight that they will not be able to move at all. Allah says:</p><p>لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ</p><p>(to protect you in your fighting.) meaning, in your battles.</p><p>فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ شَـكِرُونَ</p><p>(Are you then grateful) means, `Allah blessed you when He inspired His servant Dawud and taught him that for your sake.'</p><h2>The Power of Sulayman is unparalleled</h2><p>وَلِسُلَيْمَـنَ الرِّيحَ عَاصِفَةً</p><p>(And to Sulayman (We subjected) the wind strongly raging,) means, `We subjugated the strong wind to Sulayman.'</p><p>تَجْرِي بِأَمْرِهِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا</p><p>(running by his command towards the land which We had blessed.) meaning, the land of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria).</p><p>وَكُنَّا بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And of everything We are the All-Knower.) He had a mat made of wood on which he would place all the equipment of his kingship; horses, camels, tents and troops, then he would command the wind to carry it, and he would go underneath it and it would carry him aloft, shading him and protecting him from the heat, until it reached wherever he wanted to go in the land. Then it would come down and deposit his equipment and entourage. Allah says:</p><p>فَسَخَّرْنَا لَهُ الرِّيحَ تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ</p><p>(So, We subjected to him the wind; it blew gently by his order whithersoever he willed.) 38:36</p><p>غُدُوُّهَا شَهْرٌ وَرَوَاحُهَا شَهْرٌ</p><p>(its morning was a month's (journey), and its afternoon was a month's) 34:12</p><p>وَمِنَ الشَّيَـطِينِ مَن يَغُوصُونَ لَهُ</p><p>(And of the Shayatin were some who dived for him,) means, they dived into the water to retrieve pearls, jewels, etc., for him.</p><p>وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلاً دُونَ ذلِكَ</p><p>(and did other work besides that;) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَالشَّيَـطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّآءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ - وَآخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي الْأَصْفَادِ</p><p>(And also the Shayatin, every kind of builder and diver. And also others bound in fetters.) 38:37-38.</p><p>وَكُنَّا لَهُمْ حَـفِظِينَ</p><p>(and it was We Who guarded them.) means, Allah protected him lest any of these Shayatin did him any harm. All of them were subject to his control and domination, and none of them would have dared to approach him. He was in charge of them and if he wanted, he could set free or detain whomever among them he wished. Allah says:</p><p>وَآخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي الْأَصْفَادِ</p><p>(And also others bound in fetters.) 38:38</p>",

    "<h2>Dawud and Sulayman and the Signs which They were given; the Story of the People whose Sheep pastured at Night in the Field</h2><p>Abu Ishaq narrated from Murrah from Ibn Mas`ud: \"That crop was grapes, bunches of which were dangling.\" This was also the view of Shurayh. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Nafash means grazing.\" Shurayh, Az-Zuhri and Qatadah said: \"Nafash only happens at night.\" Qatadah added, \"and Al-Haml is grazing during the day.\"</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night;) Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said: \"Grapes which had grown and their bunches were spoiled by the sheep. Dawud (David) ruled that the owner of the grapes should keep the sheep. Sulayman (Solomon) said, `Not like this, O Prophet of Allah!' Dawud said, `How then' Sulayman said: `Give the grapes to the owner of the sheep and let him tend them until they grow back as they were, and give the sheep to the owner of the grapes and let him benefit from them until the grapes have grown back as they were. Then the grapes should be given back to their owner, and the sheep should be given back to their owner.' This is what Allah said:</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case).)\" This was also reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas.</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ وَكُلاًّ ءَاتَيْنَا حُكْماً وَعِلْماً</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case); and to each of them We gave wisdom and knowledge.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when Iyas bin Mu`awiyah was appointed as a judge, Al-Hasan came to him and found Iyas weeping. Al-Hasan said, \"Why are you weeping\" Iyas said, \"O Abu Sa`id, What I heard about judges among them a judge is he, who studies a case and his judgment is wrong, so he will go to Hell; another judge is he who is biased because of his own whims and desires, so he will go to Hell; and the other judge he who studies a case and gives the right judgement, so he will go to Paradise.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basari said: \"But what Allah tells us about Dawud and Sulayman (peace be upon them both) and the Prophets and whatever judgements they made proves that what these people said is wrong. Allah says:</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَـهِدِينَ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night; and We were witness to their judgement.) Allah praised Sulayman but He did not condemn Dawud.\" Then he -- Al-Hasan -- said, \"Allah enjoins three things upon the judges: not to sell thereby for some miserable price; not to follow their own whims and desires; and not to fear anyone concerning their judgements. \" Then he recited:</p><p>يدَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـكَ خَلِيفَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعِ الْهَوَى فَيُضِلَّكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(O Dawud!

With regard to others, it is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari from `Amir bin Al-`As that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا اجْتَهَدَ الْحَاكِمُ فَأَصَابَ، فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَإِذَا اجْتَهَدَ فَأَخْطَأَ، فَلَهُ أَجْر»</p><p>(If the judge does his best, studies the case and reaches the right conclusion, he will have two rewards. If he does his best, studies the case and reaches the wrong conclusion, he will have one reward.) This Hadith refutes the idea of Iyas, who thought that if he did his best, studied the case and reached the wrong conclusion, he would go to Hell. And Allah knows best. Similar to story in the Qur'an is the report recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«بَيْنَمَا امْرَأَتَانِ مَعَهُمَا ابْنَانِ لَهُمَا، إِذْ جَاءَ الذِّئْبُ فَأَخَذَ أَحَدَ الْابْنَيْنِ فَتَحَاكَمَتَا إِلَىىَداوُدَ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلْكُبْرَى، فَخَرَجَتَا فَدَعَاهُمَا سُلَيْمَانُ فَقَالَ: هَاتُوا السِّكِّينَ أَشُقُّهُ بَيْنَكُمَا: فَقَالَتِ الصُّغْرَى: يَرْحَمُكَ اللهُ هُوَ ابْنُهَا لَا تَشُقَّهُ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلصُّغْرَى»</p><p>(There were two women who each had a son.

    "<h2>Dawud and Sulayman and the Signs which They were given; the Story of the People whose Sheep pastured at Night in the Field</h2><p>Abu Ishaq narrated from Murrah from Ibn Mas`ud: \"That crop was grapes, bunches of which were dangling.\" This was also the view of Shurayh. Ibn `Abbas said: \"Nafash means grazing.\" Shurayh, Az-Zuhri and Qatadah said: \"Nafash only happens at night.\" Qatadah added, \"and Al-Haml is grazing during the day.\"</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night;) Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said: \"Grapes which had grown and their bunches were spoiled by the sheep. Dawud (David) ruled that the owner of the grapes should keep the sheep. Sulayman (Solomon) said, `Not like this, O Prophet of Allah!' Dawud said, `How then' Sulayman said: `Give the grapes to the owner of the sheep and let him tend them until they grow back as they were, and give the sheep to the owner of the grapes and let him benefit from them until the grapes have grown back as they were. Then the grapes should be given back to their owner, and the sheep should be given back to their owner.' This is what Allah said:</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case).)\" This was also reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas.</p><p>فَفَهَّمْنَـهَا سُلَيْمَـنَ وَكُلاًّ ءَاتَيْنَا حُكْماً وَعِلْماً</p><p>(And We made Sulayman to understand (the case); and to each of them We gave wisdom and knowledge.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when Iyas bin Mu`awiyah was appointed as a judge, Al-Hasan came to him and found Iyas weeping. Al-Hasan said, \"Why are you weeping\" Iyas said, \"O Abu Sa`id, What I heard about judges among them a judge is he, who studies a case and his judgment is wrong, so he will go to Hell; another judge is he who is biased because of his own whims and desires, so he will go to Hell; and the other judge he who studies a case and gives the right judgement, so he will go to Paradise.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basari said: \"But what Allah tells us about Dawud and Sulayman (peace be upon them both) and the Prophets and whatever judgements they made proves that what these people said is wrong. Allah says:</p><p>وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِى الْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ الْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَـهِدِينَ</p><p>(And (remember) Dawud and Sulayman, when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night; and We were witness to their judgement.) Allah praised Sulayman but He did not condemn Dawud.\" Then he -- Al-Hasan -- said, \"Allah enjoins three things upon the judges: not to sell thereby for some miserable price; not to follow their own whims and desires; and not to fear anyone concerning their judgements. \" Then he recited:</p><p>يدَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـكَ خَلِيفَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعِ الْهَوَى فَيُضِلَّكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(O Dawud! Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth and follow not your desire -- for it will mislead you from the path of Allah.) 38:26</p><p>فَلاَ تَخْشَوُاْ النَّاسَ وَاخْشَوْنِ</p><p>(Therefore fear not men but fear Me) 5:44</p><p>وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِى ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً</p><p>(and sell not My Ayat for a miserable price.) 5:44 I say: with regard to the Prophets (peace be upon them all), all of them were infallible and supported by Allah. With regard to others, it is recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari from `Amir bin Al-`As that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا اجْتَهَدَ الْحَاكِمُ فَأَصَابَ، فَلَهُ أَجْرَانِ، وَإِذَا اجْتَهَدَ فَأَخْطَأَ، فَلَهُ أَجْر»</p><p>(If the judge does his best, studies the case and reaches the right conclusion, he will have two rewards. If he does his best, studies the case and reaches the wrong conclusion, he will have one reward.) This Hadith refutes the idea of Iyas, who thought that if he did his best, studied the case and reached the wrong conclusion, he would go to Hell. And Allah knows best. Similar to story in the Qur'an is the report recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«بَيْنَمَا امْرَأَتَانِ مَعَهُمَا ابْنَانِ لَهُمَا، إِذْ جَاءَ الذِّئْبُ فَأَخَذَ أَحَدَ الْابْنَيْنِ فَتَحَاكَمَتَا إِلَىىَداوُدَ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلْكُبْرَى، فَخَرَجَتَا فَدَعَاهُمَا سُلَيْمَانُ فَقَالَ: هَاتُوا السِّكِّينَ أَشُقُّهُ بَيْنَكُمَا: فَقَالَتِ الصُّغْرَى: يَرْحَمُكَ اللهُ هُوَ ابْنُهَا لَا تَشُقَّهُ، فَقَضَى بِهِ لِلصُّغْرَى»</p><p>(There were two women who each had a son. The wolf came and took one of the children, and they referred their dispute to Dawud. He ruled that the (remaining) child belonged to the older woman. They left, then Sulayman called them and said, \"Give me a sword and I will divide him between the two of you.\" The younger woman said, \"May Allah have mercy on you! He is her child, do not cut him up!\" So he ruled that the child belonged to the younger woman). This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs. An-Nasa'i also devoted a chapter to this in the Book of Judgements.</p><p>وَسَخَّرْنَا مَعَ دَاوُودَ الْجِبَالَ يُسَبِّحْنَ وَالطَّيْرَ</p><p>(And We subjected the mountains and the birds to glorify Our praises along with Dawud.) This refers to the beauty of his voice when he recited his Book, Az-Zabur. When he recited it in a beautiful manner, the birds would stop and hover in the air, and would repeat after him, and the mountains would respond and echo his words. The Prophet passed by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari while he was reciting Qur'an at night, and he had a very beautiful voice, he stopped and listened to his recitation, and said:</p><p>«لَقَدْ أُوتِيَ هَذَا مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُد»</p><p>(This man has been given one of the wind instruments (nice voices) of the family of Dawud.) He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, if I had known that you were listening, I would have done my best for you.\"</p><p>وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ صَنْعَةَ لَبُوسٍ لَّكُمْ لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ</p><p>(And We taught him the making of metal coats of mail, to protect you in your fighting.) meaning, the manufacture of chain-armor. Qatadah said that before that, they used to wear plated armor; he was the first one to make rings of chain-armor. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَأَلَنَّا لَهُ الْحَدِيدَأَنِ اعْمَلْ سَـبِغَـتٍ وَقَدِّرْ فِى السَّرْدِ</p><p>(And We made the iron soft for him. Saying: \"Make you perfect coats of mail, and balance well the rings of chain armor.\") 34:10-11, meaning, do not make the pegs so loose that the rings (of chain mail) will shake, or make it so tight that they will not be able to move at all. Allah says:</p><p>لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ</p><p>(to protect you in your fighting.) meaning, in your battles.</p><p>فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ شَـكِرُونَ</p><p>(Are you then grateful) means, `Allah blessed you when He inspired His servant Dawud and taught him that for your sake.'</p><h2>The Power of Sulayman is unparalleled</h2><p>وَلِسُلَيْمَـنَ الرِّيحَ عَاصِفَةً</p><p>(And to Sulayman (We subjected) the wind strongly raging,) means, `We subjugated the strong wind to Sulayman.'</p><p>تَجْرِي بِأَمْرِهِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا</p><p>(running by his command towards the land which We had blessed.) meaning, the land of Ash-Sham (Greater Syria).</p><p>وَكُنَّا بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And of everything We are the All-Knower.) He had a mat made of wood on which he would place all the equipment of his kingship; horses, camels, tents and troops, then he would command the wind to carry it, and he would go underneath it and it would carry him aloft, shading him and protecting him from the heat, until it reached wherever he wanted to go in the land. Then it would come down and deposit his equipment and entourage. Allah says:</p><p>فَسَخَّرْنَا لَهُ الرِّيحَ تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ</p><p>(So, We subjected to him the wind; it blew gently by his order whithersoever he willed.) 38:36</p><p>غُدُوُّهَا شَهْرٌ وَرَوَاحُهَا شَهْرٌ</p><p>(its morning was a month's (journey), and its afternoon was a month's) 34:12</p><p>وَمِنَ الشَّيَـطِينِ مَن يَغُوصُونَ لَهُ</p><p>(And of the Shayatin were some who dived for him,) means, they dived into the water to retrieve pearls, jewels, etc., for him.</p><p>وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلاً دُونَ ذلِكَ</p><p>(and did other work besides that;) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَالشَّيَـطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّآءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ - وَآخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي الْأَصْفَادِ</p><p>(And also the Shayatin, every kind of builder and diver. And also others bound in fetters.) 38:37-38.</p><p>وَكُنَّا لَهُمْ حَـفِظِينَ</p><p>(and it was We Who guarded them.) means, Allah protected him lest any of these Shayatin did him any harm. All of them were subject to his control and domination, and none of them would have dared to approach him. He was in charge of them and if he wanted, he could set free or detain whomever among them he wished. Allah says:</p><p>وَآخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي الْأَصْفَادِ</p><p>(And also others bound in fetters.) 38:38</p>",
    "<h2>The Prophet Ayyub Allah tells us about Ayyub (Job), and the trials that struck him, affecting his wealth, children and physical health.</h2><p>He had plenty of livestock, cattle and crops, many children and beautiful houses, and he was tested in these things, losing every thing he had. Then he was tested with regard to his body, and he was left alone on the edge of the city and there was no one who treated him with compassion apart from his wife, who took care of him. It was said that it reached the stage where she was in need, so she started to serve people (to earn money) for his sake. The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ بَلَاءً الْأَنْبِيَاءُ، ثُمَّ الصَّالِحُونَ، ثُمَّ الْأَمْثَلُ فَالْأَمْثَل»</div><p>(The people who are tested the most severely are the Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best and the next best).

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَمَّا عَافَى اللهُ أَيُّوبَ أَمْطَرَ عَلَيْهِ جَرَادًا مِنْ ذَهَبٍ، فَجَعَلَ يَأْخُذُ مِنْهُ بِيَدِهِ وَيَجْعَلُهُ فِي ثَوْبِهِ، قَالَ: فَقِيلَ لَهُ: يَا أَيُّوبُ أَمَا تَشْبَعُ؟ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَنْنَيشْبَعُ مِنْ رَحْمَتِك»</div><p>(When Allah healed Ayyub, He sent upon him a shower of golden locusts, and he started to pick them up and gather them in his garment. It was said to him, \"O Ayyub, have you not had enough\" He said, \"O Lord, who can ever have enough of Your mercy) The basis of this Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs, as we shall see below.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَيْنَـهُ أَهْلَهُ وَمِثْلَهُمْ مَّعَهُمْ</div><p>(and We restored his family to him (that he had lost) and the like thereof along with them) It was reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"They themselves were restored to him.\" This was also narrated by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. Something similar was also narrated from Ibn Mas`ud and Mujahid, and this was the view of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. Mujahid said: \"It was said to him, `O Ayyub, your family will be with you in Paradise; if you want, We will bring them back to you, or if you want, We will leave them for you in Paradise and will compensate you with others like them.' He said, `No, leave them for me in Paradise.' So they were left for him in Paradise, and he was compensated with others like them in this world.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا</div><p>(as a mercy from Ourselves) means, `We did that to him as a mercy from Allah towards him.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَذِكْرَى لِلْعَـبِدِينَ</div><p>(and a Reminder for all those who worship Us.) means, `We made him an example lest those who are beset by trials think that We do that to them because We do not care for them, so that they may take him as an example of patience in accepting the decrees of Allah and bearing the trials with which He tests His servants as He wills.' And Allah has the utmost wisdom with regard to that.</p>",
    "<h2>Yunus</h2><p>This story is mentioned here, and in Surat As-Saffat and Surah Nun. Yunus bin Matta, upon him be peace, was sent by Allah to the people of Nineveh, which was a town in the area of Mawsil in northern Iraq. He called them to Allah, but they rejected him and persisted in their disbelief. So he left them in anger, threatening them with punishment after three days. When they realized that he was telling the truth and that a Prophet never lies, they went out to the desert with their children and cattle and flocks. They separated the mothers from their children, then they beseeched Allah and pleaded to Him, with the camels and their young groaning, the cows and their calves mooing, and the sheep and their lambs bleating, so Allah spared them from the punishment. Allah says:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ ءَامَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ ءَامَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ الخِزْىِ فِى الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَى حِينٍ</p><p>(Was there any town that believed (after seeing the punishment), and its faith saved it Except the people of Yunus; when they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world, and permitted them to enjoy for a while) 10:98. Yunus, meanwhile, went and traveled with some people on a ship, which was tossed about on the sea. The people were afraid that they would drown, so they cast lots to choose a man whom they would throw overboard. The lot fell to Yunus, but they refused to throw him overboard. This happened a second and a third time. Allah says:</p><p>فَسَـهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ الْمُدْحَضِينَ</p><p>(Then he (agreed to) cast lots, and he was among the losers.) 37:141 meaning, the draw went against him, so Yunus stood up, removed his garment and cast himself into the sea. Then Allah sent from the Green Sea -- according to what Ibn Mas`ud said -- a large fish which cleaved the oceans until it came and swallowed Yunus when he threw himself into the sea. Allah inspired that large fish not to devour his flesh or break his bones, (as if He said) Yunus is not food for you, rather your belly is a prison for him.</p><p>وَذَا النُّونِ</p><p>(And (remember) Dhun-Nun,) Here Nun refers to the fish; it is correct for it to be attributed to him here.</p><p>إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَـضِباً</p><p>(when he went off in anger,) Ad-Dahhak said: \"Anger towards his people.\"</p><p>فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(and imagined that We shall not punish him!) meaning, constrict him in the belly of the fish. Something similar to this was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and he quoted as evidence for that the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً</p><p>(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease) 65:7.</p><p>فَنَادَى فِى الظُّلُمَـتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(But he cried through the depths of darkness (saying): \"There is no God but You, Glorified be You! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.\") Ibn Mas`ud said regarding the `depths of darkness': \"The darkness of the belly of the fish, the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the night.\" This was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, `Amr bin Maymun, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and Qatadah. Salim bin Abu Al-Ja`d said: \"The darkness of the fish in the belly of another fish in the darkness of the sea.\" Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas and others said: \"This was because the fish took him through the sea, cleaving it until it reached the bottom of the sea. Yunus heard the rocks at the bottom of the sea uttering glorification of Allah, at which point he said:</p><p>لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(There is no God but You, Glorified be You! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)\" `Awf Al-A`rabi said: \"When Yunus found himself in the belly of the fish, he thought that he had died. Then he moved his legs. When he moved his legs, he prostrated where he was, then he called out: `O Lord, I have taken a place of worship to You in a place which no other person has reached.\"'</p><p>فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَـهُ مِنَ الْغَمِّ</p><p>(So `We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress.) means, `We brought him forth from the belly of the fish and from that darkness.'</p><p>وَكَذلِكَ نُنجِـى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(And thus We do deliver the believers.) means, when they are in difficulty and they call upon Us and repent to Us, especially if they call upon Us with these words at the time of distress. The leader of the Prophets encouraged us to call upon Allah with these words. Imam Ahmad recorded that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"I passed by `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, in the Masjid, and greeted him. He stared at me but did not return my Salam. I went to `Umar bin Al-Khattab and said: `O Commander of the faithful, has something happened in Islam' I said that twice. He said, `No, why do you ask' I said, `I passed by `Uthman a short while ago in the Masjid and greeted him, and he stared at me but he did not return my Salam.' `Umar sent for `Uthman and asked him, `Why did you not return your brother's Salam' He said, `That is not true.' Sa`d said, `Yes it is.' It reached the point where they both swore oaths. Then `Uthman remembered and said, `Yes, you are right, I seek the forgiveness of Allah and I repent to Him. You passed by me a short while ago but I was preoccupied with thoughts of something I had heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, which I never think of but a veil comes down over my eyes and my heart.' Sa`d said: `And I will tell you what it was. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ told us the first part of the supplication then a bedouin came and kept him busy, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and I followed him. When I felt worried that he would enter his house, I stamped my feet. I turned to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«مَنْ هَذَا، أَبُو إِسْحَاقَ؟»</p><p>(Who is this Abu Ishaq) I said, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\" He said,</p><p>«فَمَه»</p><p>(What is the matter) I said, \"Nothing, by Allah, except that you told us the first part of the supplication, then this bedouin came and kept you busy.\" He said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ دَعْوَةُ ذِي النُّونِ إِذْ هُوَ فِي بَطْنِ الْحُوتِ</p><p>(Yes, the supplicaiton of Dhun-Nun when he was in the belly of the fish:</p><p>لاَّ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَـنَكَ إِنِّى كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(There is no God but You, Glorified be You!

    "<h2>`Isa and Maryam the True Believer</h2><p>Here Allah mentions the story of Maryam and her son `Isa, just after mentioning Zakariyya and his son Yahya, may peace be upon them all. He mentions the story of Zakariyya first, followed by the story of Maryam because the one is connected to the other. The former is the story of a child being born to an old man of advanced years, from an old woman who had been barren and had never given birth when she was younger. Then Allah mentions the story of Maryam which is even more wondrous, for in this case a child was born from a female without (the involvement of) a male. These stories also appear in Surah Al `Imran and in Surah Maryam. Here Allah mentions the story of Zakariyya and follows it with the story of Maryam, where He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّتِى أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</div><p>(And she who guarded her chastity,) means, Maryam (peace be upon her).

This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</div><p>(And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) 19:21</p>",

Allah says:</p><p>هَـذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ وَكَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى حَقّاًوَتَرَكْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَمُوجُ فِى بَعْضٍ</p><p>(This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground.

A Hadab is a raised portion of land. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ath-Thawri and others. This is how their emergence is described, as if the listener can see it.</p><p>وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ</p><p>(And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) 35:14. This is information given by the One Who knows what has happened and what is yet to come, the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on earth. There is no god except Him. Ibn Jarir narrated that `Ubaydullah bin Abi Yazid said, \"Ibn `Abbas saw some young boys playing and pouncing on one another, and said, this is how Ya'juj and Ma'juj will emerge.\" Their emergence has been described in numerous Hadiths of the Prophet . The First Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«تُفْتَحُ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ عَلَى النَّاسِ، كَمَا قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>فَيَغْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ وَيَنْحَازُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ عَنْهُمْ إِلَى مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيَضُمُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، وَيَشْرَبُونَ مِيَاهَ الْأَرْضِ، حَتَّى إِنَّ بَعْضَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِالنَّهَرِ فَيَشْرَبُونَ مَا فِيهِ حَتَّى يَتْرُكُوهُ يَابِسًا، حَتَّى إِنَّ مَنْ بَعْدَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِذَلِكَ النَّهَرِ فَيَقُولُ: قَدْ كَانَ هَهُنَا مَاءٌ مَرَّةً، حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يَبْقَ مِنَ النَّاسِ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَحَدٌ فِي حِصْنٍ أَوْ مَدِينَةٍ، قَالَ قَائِلُهُمْ: هَؤُلَاءِ أَهْلُ الْأَرْضِ قَدْ فَرَغْنَا مِنْهُمْ بَقِيَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، قَالَ: ثُمَّ يَهُزُّ أَحَدُهُمْ حَرْبَتَهُ، ثُمَّ يَرْمِي بِهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَتَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِ مُخضَّبَةً دَمًا لِلْبَلَاءِ وَالْفِتْنَةِ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ دُودًا فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ كَنَغَفِ الْجَرَادِ الَّذِي يَخْرُجُ فِي أَعْنَاقِهِ، فَيُصْبِحُونَ مَوْتَى لَا يُسْمَعُ لَهُمْ حِسٌّ، فَيَقُولُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ: أَلَا رَجُلٌ يَشْرِي لَنَا نَفْسَهُ فَيَنْظُرَ مَا فَعَلَ هَذَا الْعَدُوُّ؟ قَالَ: فَيَتَجَرَّدُ رَجُلٌ مِنْهُمْ مُحْتَسِبًا نَفْسَهُ، قَدْ أَوْطَنَهَا عَلَى أَنَّهُ مَقْتُولٌ، فَيَنْزِلُ فَيَجِدُهُمْ مَوْتَى، بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ، فَيُنَادِي: يَا مَعْشَرَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، أَلَا أَبْشِرُوا إِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَدْ كَفَاكُمْ عَدُوَّكُمْ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْ مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيُسَرِّحُونَ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، فَمَا يَكُونُ لَهُمْ رَعْيٌ إِلَّا لُحُومُهُمْ، فَتَشْكَرُ عَنْهُمْ كَأَحْسَنِ مَا شَكِرَتْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ مِنَ النَّبَاتِ أَصَاَبَتْهُ قَط»</p><p>(Ya'juj and Ma'juj will be let loose and will emerge upon mankind, as Allah says: (and they swoop down from every Hadab.) They will overwhelm the people, and the Muslims will retreat to their cities and strongholds, bringing their flocks with them. They Ya'juj and Ma'juj will drink all the water of the land until some of them will pass a river and drink it dry, then those who come after them will pass by that place and will say, \"There used to be water here once.\" Then there will be no one left except those who are in their strongholds and cities. Then one of them will say, \"We have defeated the people of the earth; now the people of heaven are left.\" One of them will shake his spear and hurl it into the sky, and it will come back stained with blood, as a test and a trial for them. While this is happening, Allah will send a worm in their necks, like the worm that is found in date-stones or in the nostrils of sheep, and they will die and their clamor will cease. Then the Muslims will say, \"Who will volunteer to find out what the enemy is doing\" One of them will step forward and volunteer, knowing that he will likely be killed. He will go down and will find them dead, lying on top of one another. Then he will call out, \"O Muslims! Rejoice that Allah has sufficed you against your enemy!\" Then they will come out of their cities and strongholds, and will let their flocks out to graze, but they will have nothing to graze upon except the flesh of these people (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), but it will fill them better than any vegetation they have ever eaten before.) It was also recorded by Ibn Majah. The Second Hadith Imam Ahmad also recorded from An-Nawwas bin Sam`an Al-Kilabi that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned the Dajjal one morning. \"Sometimes he described him as insignificant and sometimes he described him as so significant that we felt as if he were in the cluster of palm trees. He said:</p><p>«غَيْرُ الدَّجَّالِ أَخْوَفُنِي عَلَيْكُمْ. فَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَأَنَا فِيكُمْ، فَأَنَا حَجِيجُهُ دُونَكُمْ، وَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَلَسْتُ فِيكُمْ، فَكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ حَجيجُ نَفْسِهِ، وَاللهُ خَلِيفَتِي عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ، وَإِنَّهُ شَابٌّ جَعْدٌ قَطَطٌ، عَيْنُهُ طَافِيَةٌ، وَإِنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ خَلَّةً بَيْنَ الشَّامِ وَالْعِرَاقِ فَعَاثَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا، يَا عِبَادَ اللهِ اثْبُتُوا»</p><p>(There are other things that I fear for you more than the Dajjal. If he emerges while I am among you, I will deal with him for you. If he emerges when I am not among you, then each man will have to deal with him for himself, and Allah will take care of each Muslim on my behalf. He (the Dajjal) will be a young man with short, curly hair and a floating eye. He will emerge in a place between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O servants of Allah, be steadfast!) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how long will he remain on earth' He said,</p><p>«أَرْبَعُونَ يَوْمًا، يَوْمٌ كَسَنَةٍ، وَيَوْمٌ كَشَهْرٍ، يَوْمٌ كَجُمُعَةٍ، وَسَائِرُ أَيَّامِهِ كَأَيَّامِكُم»</p><p>(Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of the days like your days.) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, on that day which will be like a year, will the prayers of one day and one night be sufficient' He said,</p><p>«لَا، اقْدُرُوا لَهُ قَدْرَه»</p><p>(No, but you will have to compute it according to its due proportion (and pray accordingly).) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how fast will he move across the land' He said,</p><p>«كَالْغَيْثِ اسْتَدْبَرَتْهُ الرِّيح»</p><p>(Like a cloud driven by the wind.) He said,</p><p>«فَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُ، فَيَأْمُرُ السَّمَاءَ فَتُمْطِرُ، وَالْأَرْضَ فَتُنْبِتُ، وَتَرُوحُ عَلَيْهِمْ سَارِحَتُهُمْ، وَهِيَ أَطْوَلُ مَا كَانَتْ ذُرًى، وَأَمَدَّهُ خَوَاصِرَ، وَأَسْبَغَهُ ضُرُوعًا، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَرُدُّونَ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلَهُ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ أَمْوَالُهُمْ فَيُصْبِحُونَ مُمْحِلِينَ، لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ شَيْءٌ، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْخَرِبَةِ فَيَقُولُ لَهَا: أَخْرِجِي كُنُوزَكِ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ كُنُوزُهَا كَيَعَاسِيبِ النَّحْلِ قَالَ: وَيَأْمُرُ بِرَجُلٍ فَيُقْتَلُ، فَيَضْرِبُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ فَيَقْطَعُهُ جَزْلَتَيْنِ رَمْيَةَ الْغَرَضِ، ثُمَّ يَدْعُوهُ فَيُقْبِلُ إِلَيْهِ، يَتَهَلَّلُ وَجْهُهُ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، إِذْ بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ، فَيَنْزِلُ عِنْدَ الْمَنَارَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ شَرْقِيَّ دِمَشْقَ بَيْنَ مَهْرُودَتَيْنِ، وَاضِعًا يَدَيْهِ عَلَى أَجْنِحَةِ مَلَكَيْنِ، فَيَتْبَعُهُ فَيُدْرِكُهُ فَيَقْتُلُهُ عِنْدَ بَابِ لُدَ الشَّرْقِيِّ قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ كَذَلِكَ، إِذْ أَوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ أَنِّي قَدْ أَخْرَجْتُ عِبَادًا مِنْ عِبَادِي، لَا يَدَانِ لَكَ بِقِتَالِهِمْ، فَحَرِّزْ عِبَادِي إِلَى الطُّورِ، فَيَبْعَثُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، كَمَا قَالَ تَعَالَى:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>(He will come to a people and call them to his way and they will respond to him. He will issue a command to the sky and it will rain, and to the earth and it will bring forth vegetation, then their livestock will come to them in the evening with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks wide and fat. Then he will come to another people and call them to his way and they will refuse, and their wealth will leave with him, and they will be faced with drought, with none of their wealth left. Then he will walk through the wasteland and will say to it, \"Bring forth your treasure,\" and its treasure will come forth like a swarm of bees. Then he will issue commands that a man be killed, and he will strike him with a sword and cut him into two pieces, and (put these pieces as far apart) as the distance between an archer and his target. Then he will call him, and the man will come to him with his face shining. At that point Allah will send the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam, who will come down to the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and with his hands resting on the wings of two angels. He will search for him (the Dajjal) until he catches up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. Then Allah will reveal to `Isa ibn Maryam the words: \"I have brought forth from amongst My creatures people against whom none will be able to fight. Take My servants safely to the Mount (Tur).\" Then Allah will send Ya'juj and Ma'juj, as Allah says: (and they swoop down from every Hadab.))</p><p>فَيَرْغَبُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، فَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَغَفًا فِي رِقَابِهِمْ فَيُصْبِحُونَ فَرْسَى كَمَوْتِ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، فَيَهْبِطُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ فَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بَيْتًا إِلَّا قَدْ مَلَأَهُ زَهَمُهُمْ وَنَتَنُهُمْ، فَيَرْغَبُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ،فَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا كَأَعْنَاقِ الْبُخْتِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُمْ فَتَطْرَحُهُمْ حَيْثُ شَاءَ الله»</p><p>(`Isa and his companions will beseech Allah, and Allah will send against them insects which will attack their necks, and in the morning they will all perish as one. Then `Isa and his companions will come down and they will not find a single spot on earth that is free from their putrefaction and stench.

Ibn Jabir said: \"`Ata' bin Yazid As-Saksaki told me, from Ka`b or someone else: `They will throw them into Al-Mahbal.' Ibn Jabir said: \"I said, `O Abu Yazid, and where is Al-Mahbal\" He said, \"In the east (where the sun rises).\" He said:</p><p>«وَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ مَطَرًا لَا يَكُنُّ مِنْهُ بَيْتُ مَدَرٍ وَلَا وَبَرٍ أَرْبَعِينَ يَوْمًا، فَيَغْسِلُ الْأَرْضَ حَتَّى يَتْرُكَهَا كَالزَّلَفَةِ، وَيُقَالُ لِلْأَرْضِ: أَنْبِتِي ثَمَرَكِ وَرُدِّي بَرَكَتَكِ، قَالَ: فَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَأْكُلُ النَّفَرُ مِنَ الرُّمَّانَةِ فَيَسْتَظِلُّونَ بِقِحْفِهَا، وَيُبَارَكُ فِي الرِّسْلِ حَتَّى إِنَّ اللِّقْحَةَ مِنَ الْإِبِلِ لَتَكْفِي الْفِئَامَ مِنَ النَّاسِ، وَاللِّقْحَةَ مِنَ الْبَقَرِ تَكْفِي الْفَخِذَ، وَالشَّاةَ مِنَ الْغَنَمِ تَكْفِي أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ، قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، إِذْ بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ رِيحًا طَيِّبَةً، فَتَأْخُذُهُمْ تَحْتَ آبَاطِهِمْ فَتَقْبِضُ رُوحَ كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ أَوْ قَالَ: كُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ وَيَبْقَى شِرَارُ النَّاسِ، يَتَهَارَجُونَ تَهَارُجَ الْحُمُرِ، وَعَلَيْهِمْ تَقُومُ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(Then Allah will send rain which no house of clay or (tent of) camel's hair will be able to keep out, for forty days, and the earth will be washed until it looks like a mirror.

And in this Ayah, Allah says:</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>(Until, when Ya`juj and Ma`juj are let loose, and they swoop down from every Hadab.) meaning, they will come forth quickly to spread corruption. A Hadab is a raised portion of land. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ath-Thawri and others. This is how their emergence is described, as if the listener can see it.</p><p>وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ</p><p>(And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) 35:14. This is information given by the One Who knows what has happened and what is yet to come, the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on earth. There is no god except Him. Ibn Jarir narrated that `Ubaydullah bin Abi Yazid said, \"Ibn `Abbas saw some young boys playing and pouncing on one another, and said, this is how Ya'juj and Ma'juj will emerge.\" Their emergence has been described in numerous Hadiths of the Prophet . The First Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«تُفْتَحُ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ عَلَى النَّاسِ، كَمَا قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>فَيَغْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ وَيَنْحَازُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ عَنْهُمْ إِلَى مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيَضُمُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، وَيَشْرَبُونَ مِيَاهَ الْأَرْضِ، حَتَّى إِنَّ بَعْضَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِالنَّهَرِ فَيَشْرَبُونَ مَا فِيهِ حَتَّى يَتْرُكُوهُ يَابِسًا، حَتَّى إِنَّ مَنْ بَعْدَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِذَلِكَ النَّهَرِ فَيَقُولُ: قَدْ كَانَ هَهُنَا مَاءٌ مَرَّةً، حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يَبْقَ مِنَ النَّاسِ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَحَدٌ فِي حِصْنٍ أَوْ مَدِينَةٍ، قَالَ قَائِلُهُمْ: هَؤُلَاءِ أَهْلُ الْأَرْضِ قَدْ فَرَغْنَا مِنْهُمْ بَقِيَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، قَالَ: ثُمَّ يَهُزُّ أَحَدُهُمْ حَرْبَتَهُ، ثُمَّ يَرْمِي بِهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَتَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِ مُخضَّبَةً دَمًا لِلْبَلَاءِ وَالْفِتْنَةِ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ دُودًا فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ كَنَغَفِ الْجَرَادِ الَّذِي يَخْرُجُ فِي أَعْنَاقِهِ، فَيُصْبِحُونَ مَوْتَى لَا يُسْمَعُ لَهُمْ حِسٌّ، فَيَقُولُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ: أَلَا رَجُلٌ يَشْرِي لَنَا نَفْسَهُ فَيَنْظُرَ مَا فَعَلَ هَذَا الْعَدُوُّ؟ قَالَ: فَيَتَجَرَّدُ رَجُلٌ مِنْهُمْ مُحْتَسِبًا نَفْسَهُ، قَدْ أَوْطَنَهَا عَلَى أَنَّهُ مَقْتُولٌ، فَيَنْزِلُ فَيَجِدُهُمْ مَوْتَى، بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ، فَيُنَادِي: يَا مَعْشَرَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، أَلَا أَبْشِرُوا إِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَدْ كَفَاكُمْ عَدُوَّكُمْ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْ مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيُسَرِّحُونَ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، فَمَا يَكُونُ لَهُمْ رَعْيٌ إِلَّا لُحُومُهُمْ، فَتَشْكَرُ عَنْهُمْ كَأَحْسَنِ مَا شَكِرَتْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ مِنَ النَّبَاتِ أَصَاَبَتْهُ قَط»</p><p>(Ya'juj and Ma'juj will be let loose and will emerge upon mankind, as Allah says: (and they swoop down from every Hadab.) They will overwhelm the people, and the Muslims will retreat to their cities and strongholds, bringing their flocks with them. They Ya'juj and Ma'juj will drink all the water of the land until some of them will pass a river and drink it dry, then those who come after them will pass by that place and will say, \"There used to be water here once.\" Then there will be no one left except those who are in their strongholds and cities. Then one of them will say, \"We have defeated the people of the earth; now the people of heaven are left.\" One of them will shake his spear and hurl it into the sky, and it will come back stained with blood, as a test and a trial for them. While this is happening, Allah will send a worm in their necks, like the worm that is found in date-stones or in the nostrils of sheep, and they will die and their clamor will cease. Then the Muslims will say, \"Who will volunteer to find out what the enemy is doing\" One of them will step forward and volunteer, knowing that he will likely be killed. He will go down and will find them dead, lying on top of one another. Then he will call out, \"O Muslims! Rejoice that Allah has sufficed you against your enemy!\" Then they will come out of their cities and strongholds, and will let their flocks out to graze, but they will have nothing to graze upon except the flesh of these people (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), but it will fill them better than any vegetation they have ever eaten before.) It was also recorded by Ibn Majah. The Second Hadith Imam Ahmad also recorded from An-Nawwas bin Sam`an Al-Kilabi that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned the Dajjal one morning. \"Sometimes he described him as insignificant and sometimes he described him as so significant that we felt as if he were in the cluster of palm trees. He said:</p><p>«غَيْرُ الدَّجَّالِ أَخْوَفُنِي عَلَيْكُمْ. فَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَأَنَا فِيكُمْ، فَأَنَا حَجِيجُهُ دُونَكُمْ، وَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَلَسْتُ فِيكُمْ، فَكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ حَجيجُ نَفْسِهِ، وَاللهُ خَلِيفَتِي عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ، وَإِنَّهُ شَابٌّ جَعْدٌ قَطَطٌ، عَيْنُهُ طَافِيَةٌ، وَإِنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ خَلَّةً بَيْنَ الشَّامِ وَالْعِرَاقِ فَعَاثَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا، يَا عِبَادَ اللهِ اثْبُتُوا»</p><p>(There are other things that I fear for you more than the Dajjal. If he emerges while I am among you, I will deal with him for you. If he emerges when I am not among you, then each man will have to deal with him for himself, and Allah will take care of each Muslim on my behalf. He (the Dajjal) will be a young man with short, curly hair and a floating eye. He will emerge in a place between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O servants of Allah, be steadfast!) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how long will he remain on earth' He said,</p><p>«أَرْبَعُونَ يَوْمًا، يَوْمٌ كَسَنَةٍ، وَيَوْمٌ كَشَهْرٍ، يَوْمٌ كَجُمُعَةٍ، وَسَائِرُ أَيَّامِهِ كَأَيَّامِكُم»</p><p>(Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of the days like your days.) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, on that day which will be like a year, will the prayers of one day and one night be sufficient' He said,</p><p>«لَا، اقْدُرُوا لَهُ قَدْرَه»</p><p>(No, but you will have to compute it according to its due proportion (and pray accordingly).) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how fast will he move across the land' He said,</p><p>«كَالْغَيْثِ اسْتَدْبَرَتْهُ الرِّيح»</p><p>(Like a cloud driven by the wind.) He said,</p><p>«فَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُ، فَيَأْمُرُ السَّمَاءَ فَتُمْطِرُ، وَالْأَرْضَ فَتُنْبِتُ، وَتَرُوحُ عَلَيْهِمْ سَارِحَتُهُمْ، وَهِيَ أَطْوَلُ مَا كَانَتْ ذُرًى، وَأَمَدَّهُ خَوَاصِرَ، وَأَسْبَغَهُ ضُرُوعًا، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَرُدُّونَ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلَهُ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ أَمْوَالُهُمْ فَيُصْبِحُونَ مُمْحِلِينَ، لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ شَيْءٌ، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْخَرِبَةِ فَيَقُولُ لَهَا: أَخْرِجِي كُنُوزَكِ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ كُنُوزُهَا كَيَعَاسِيبِ النَّحْلِ قَالَ: وَيَأْمُرُ بِرَجُلٍ فَيُقْتَلُ، فَيَضْرِبُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ فَيَقْطَعُهُ جَزْلَتَيْنِ رَمْيَةَ الْغَرَضِ، ثُمَّ يَدْعُوهُ فَيُقْبِلُ إِلَيْهِ، يَتَهَلَّلُ وَجْهُهُ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، إِذْ بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ، فَيَنْزِلُ عِنْدَ الْمَنَارَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ شَرْقِيَّ دِمَشْقَ بَيْنَ مَهْرُودَتَيْنِ، وَاضِعًا يَدَيْهِ عَلَى أَجْنِحَةِ مَلَكَيْنِ، فَيَتْبَعُهُ فَيُدْرِكُهُ فَيَقْتُلُهُ عِنْدَ بَابِ لُدَ الشَّرْقِيِّ قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ كَذَلِكَ، إِذْ أَوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ أَنِّي قَدْ أَخْرَجْتُ عِبَادًا مِنْ عِبَادِي، لَا يَدَانِ لَكَ بِقِتَالِهِمْ، فَحَرِّزْ عِبَادِي إِلَى الطُّورِ، فَيَبْعَثُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، كَمَا قَالَ تَعَالَى:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>(He will come to a people and call them to his way and they will respond to him.

Then he will come to another people and call them to his way and they will refuse, and their wealth will leave with him, and they will be faced with drought, with none of their wealth left. Then he will walk through the wasteland and will say to it, \"Bring forth your treasure,\" and its treasure will come forth like a swarm of bees. Then he will issue commands that a man be killed, and he will strike him with a sword and cut him into two pieces, and (put these pieces as far apart) as the distance between an archer and his target. Then he will call him, and the man will come to him with his face shining. At that point Allah will send the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam, who will come down to the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and with his hands resting on the wings of two angels. He will search for him (the Dajjal) until he catches up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. Then Allah will reveal to `Isa ibn Maryam the words: \"I have brought forth from amongst My creatures people against whom none will be able to fight.

The Hour has drawn nigh and when it comes to pass, the disbelievers will say: \"This is a difficult Day.\" Allah says:</p><p>فَإِذَا هِىَ شَـخِصَةٌ أَبْصَـرُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(Then, you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly staring in horror.) because of the horror of the tremendous events that they are witnessing.</p><p>يوَيْلَنَآ</p><p>(Woe to us!) means, they will say, `Woe to us!'</p><p>قَدْ كُنَّا فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</p><p>(We were indeed heedless of this) means, in the world.</p><p>بَلْ كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(nay, but we were wrongdoers.) they will admit their wrong- doing at the time when that will not help them at all.</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p>",
    "<h2>Those who have been destroyed, will never return to this World.</h2><p>وَحَرَامٌ عَلَى قَرْيَةٍ</p><p>(And a ban is laid on every town) Ibn `Abbas said, \"it is enforced\", i.e., it has been decreed that the people of each township that has been destroyed will never return to this world before the Day of Resurrection, as is reported clearly through other narrations from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir, Qatadah and others.</p><h2>Ya'juj and Ma'juj</h2><p>حَتَّى إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ</p><p>(Until, when Ya`juj and Ma`juj are let loose,) We have already mentioned that they are from the progeny of Adam, upon him be peace; they are also descents of Nuh through his son Yafith (Japheth), who was the father of the Turks, Turk referring to the group of them who were left behind the barrier which was built by Dhul-Qarnayn. Allah says:</p><p>هَـذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ وَكَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّى حَقّاًوَتَرَكْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَمُوجُ فِى بَعْضٍ</p><p>(This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the promise of my Lord is ever true. And on that Day, We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another...)18:98-99. And in this Ayah, Allah says:</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>(Until, when Ya`juj and Ma`juj are let loose, and they swoop down from every Hadab.) meaning, they will come forth quickly to spread corruption. A Hadab is a raised portion of land. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ath-Thawri and others. This is how their emergence is described, as if the listener can see it.</p><p>وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ</p><p>(And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) 35:14. This is information given by the One Who knows what has happened and what is yet to come, the One Who knows the unseen in the heavens and on earth. There is no god except Him. Ibn Jarir narrated that `Ubaydullah bin Abi Yazid said, \"Ibn `Abbas saw some young boys playing and pouncing on one another, and said, this is how Ya'juj and Ma'juj will emerge.\" Their emergence has been described in numerous Hadiths of the Prophet . The First Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«تُفْتَحُ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ عَلَى النَّاسِ، كَمَا قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>فَيَغْشَوْنَ النَّاسَ وَيَنْحَازُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ عَنْهُمْ إِلَى مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيَضُمُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، وَيَشْرَبُونَ مِيَاهَ الْأَرْضِ، حَتَّى إِنَّ بَعْضَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِالنَّهَرِ فَيَشْرَبُونَ مَا فِيهِ حَتَّى يَتْرُكُوهُ يَابِسًا، حَتَّى إِنَّ مَنْ بَعْدَهُمْ لَيَمُرُّ بِذَلِكَ النَّهَرِ فَيَقُولُ: قَدْ كَانَ هَهُنَا مَاءٌ مَرَّةً، حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يَبْقَ مِنَ النَّاسِ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَحَدٌ فِي حِصْنٍ أَوْ مَدِينَةٍ، قَالَ قَائِلُهُمْ: هَؤُلَاءِ أَهْلُ الْأَرْضِ قَدْ فَرَغْنَا مِنْهُمْ بَقِيَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، قَالَ: ثُمَّ يَهُزُّ أَحَدُهُمْ حَرْبَتَهُ، ثُمَّ يَرْمِي بِهَا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَتَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِ مُخضَّبَةً دَمًا لِلْبَلَاءِ وَالْفِتْنَةِ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ دُودًا فِي أَعْنَاقِهِمْ كَنَغَفِ الْجَرَادِ الَّذِي يَخْرُجُ فِي أَعْنَاقِهِ، فَيُصْبِحُونَ مَوْتَى لَا يُسْمَعُ لَهُمْ حِسٌّ، فَيَقُولُ الْمُسْلِمُونَ: أَلَا رَجُلٌ يَشْرِي لَنَا نَفْسَهُ فَيَنْظُرَ مَا فَعَلَ هَذَا الْعَدُوُّ؟ قَالَ: فَيَتَجَرَّدُ رَجُلٌ مِنْهُمْ مُحْتَسِبًا نَفْسَهُ، قَدْ أَوْطَنَهَا عَلَى أَنَّهُ مَقْتُولٌ، فَيَنْزِلُ فَيَجِدُهُمْ مَوْتَى، بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ، فَيُنَادِي: يَا مَعْشَرَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، أَلَا أَبْشِرُوا إِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَدْ كَفَاكُمْ عَدُوَّكُمْ، فَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْ مَدَائِنِهِمْ وَحُصُونِهِمْ، وَيُسَرِّحُونَ مَوَاشِيَهُمْ، فَمَا يَكُونُ لَهُمْ رَعْيٌ إِلَّا لُحُومُهُمْ، فَتَشْكَرُ عَنْهُمْ كَأَحْسَنِ مَا شَكِرَتْ عَنْ شَيْءٍ مِنَ النَّبَاتِ أَصَاَبَتْهُ قَط»</p><p>(Ya'juj and Ma'juj will be let loose and will emerge upon mankind, as Allah says: (and they swoop down from every Hadab.) They will overwhelm the people, and the Muslims will retreat to their cities and strongholds, bringing their flocks with them. They Ya'juj and Ma'juj will drink all the water of the land until some of them will pass a river and drink it dry, then those who come after them will pass by that place and will say, \"There used to be water here once.\" Then there will be no one left except those who are in their strongholds and cities. Then one of them will say, \"We have defeated the people of the earth; now the people of heaven are left.\" One of them will shake his spear and hurl it into the sky, and it will come back stained with blood, as a test and a trial for them. While this is happening, Allah will send a worm in their necks, like the worm that is found in date-stones or in the nostrils of sheep, and they will die and their clamor will cease. Then the Muslims will say, \"Who will volunteer to find out what the enemy is doing\" One of them will step forward and volunteer, knowing that he will likely be killed. He will go down and will find them dead, lying on top of one another. Then he will call out, \"O Muslims! Rejoice that Allah has sufficed you against your enemy!\" Then they will come out of their cities and strongholds, and will let their flocks out to graze, but they will have nothing to graze upon except the flesh of these people (Ya'juj and Ma'juj), but it will fill them better than any vegetation they have ever eaten before.) It was also recorded by Ibn Majah. The Second Hadith Imam Ahmad also recorded from An-Nawwas bin Sam`an Al-Kilabi that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned the Dajjal one morning. \"Sometimes he described him as insignificant and sometimes he described him as so significant that we felt as if he were in the cluster of palm trees. He said:</p><p>«غَيْرُ الدَّجَّالِ أَخْوَفُنِي عَلَيْكُمْ. فَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَأَنَا فِيكُمْ، فَأَنَا حَجِيجُهُ دُونَكُمْ، وَإِنْ يَخْرُجْ وَلَسْتُ فِيكُمْ، فَكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ حَجيجُ نَفْسِهِ، وَاللهُ خَلِيفَتِي عَلَى كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ، وَإِنَّهُ شَابٌّ جَعْدٌ قَطَطٌ، عَيْنُهُ طَافِيَةٌ، وَإِنَّهُ يَخْرُجُ خَلَّةً بَيْنَ الشَّامِ وَالْعِرَاقِ فَعَاثَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا، يَا عِبَادَ اللهِ اثْبُتُوا»</p><p>(There are other things that I fear for you more than the Dajjal. If he emerges while I am among you, I will deal with him for you. If he emerges when I am not among you, then each man will have to deal with him for himself, and Allah will take care of each Muslim on my behalf. He (the Dajjal) will be a young man with short, curly hair and a floating eye. He will emerge in a place between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O servants of Allah, be steadfast!) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how long will he remain on earth' He said,</p><p>«أَرْبَعُونَ يَوْمًا، يَوْمٌ كَسَنَةٍ، وَيَوْمٌ كَشَهْرٍ، يَوْمٌ كَجُمُعَةٍ، وَسَائِرُ أَيَّامِهِ كَأَيَّامِكُم»</p><p>(Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of the days like your days.) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, on that day which will be like a year, will the prayers of one day and one night be sufficient' He said,</p><p>«لَا، اقْدُرُوا لَهُ قَدْرَه»</p><p>(No, but you will have to compute it according to its due proportion (and pray accordingly).) We said, `O Messenger of Allah, how fast will he move across the land' He said,</p><p>«كَالْغَيْثِ اسْتَدْبَرَتْهُ الرِّيح»</p><p>(Like a cloud driven by the wind.) He said,</p><p>«فَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُ، فَيَأْمُرُ السَّمَاءَ فَتُمْطِرُ، وَالْأَرْضَ فَتُنْبِتُ، وَتَرُوحُ عَلَيْهِمْ سَارِحَتُهُمْ، وَهِيَ أَطْوَلُ مَا كَانَتْ ذُرًى، وَأَمَدَّهُ خَوَاصِرَ، وَأَسْبَغَهُ ضُرُوعًا، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْحَيِّ فَيَدْعُوهُمْ فَيَرُدُّونَ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلَهُ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ أَمْوَالُهُمْ فَيُصْبِحُونَ مُمْحِلِينَ، لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ شَيْءٌ، وَيَمُرُّ بِالْخَرِبَةِ فَيَقُولُ لَهَا: أَخْرِجِي كُنُوزَكِ، فَتَتْبَعُهُ كُنُوزُهَا كَيَعَاسِيبِ النَّحْلِ قَالَ: وَيَأْمُرُ بِرَجُلٍ فَيُقْتَلُ، فَيَضْرِبُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ فَيَقْطَعُهُ جَزْلَتَيْنِ رَمْيَةَ الْغَرَضِ، ثُمَّ يَدْعُوهُ فَيُقْبِلُ إِلَيْهِ، يَتَهَلَّلُ وَجْهُهُ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، إِذْ بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ، فَيَنْزِلُ عِنْدَ الْمَنَارَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ شَرْقِيَّ دِمَشْقَ بَيْنَ مَهْرُودَتَيْنِ، وَاضِعًا يَدَيْهِ عَلَى أَجْنِحَةِ مَلَكَيْنِ، فَيَتْبَعُهُ فَيُدْرِكُهُ فَيَقْتُلُهُ عِنْدَ بَابِ لُدَ الشَّرْقِيِّ قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ كَذَلِكَ، إِذْ أَوْحَى اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَى عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ أَنِّي قَدْ أَخْرَجْتُ عِبَادًا مِنْ عِبَادِي، لَا يَدَانِ لَكَ بِقِتَالِهِمْ، فَحَرِّزْ عِبَادِي إِلَى الطُّورِ، فَيَبْعَثُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، كَمَا قَالَ تَعَالَى:</p><p>وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ</p><p>(He will come to a people and call them to his way and they will respond to him. He will issue a command to the sky and it will rain, and to the earth and it will bring forth vegetation, then their livestock will come to them in the evening with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks wide and fat. Then he will come to another people and call them to his way and they will refuse, and their wealth will leave with him, and they will be faced with drought, with none of their wealth left. Then he will walk through the wasteland and will say to it, \"Bring forth your treasure,\" and its treasure will come forth like a swarm of bees. Then he will issue commands that a man be killed, and he will strike him with a sword and cut him into two pieces, and (put these pieces as far apart) as the distance between an archer and his target. Then he will call him, and the man will come to him with his face shining. At that point Allah will send the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam, who will come down to the white minaret in the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and with his hands resting on the wings of two angels. He will search for him (the Dajjal) until he catches up with him at the eastern gate of Ludd, where he will kill him. Then Allah will reveal to `Isa ibn Maryam the words: \"I have brought forth from amongst My creatures people against whom none will be able to fight. Take My servants safely to the Mount (Tur).\" Then Allah will send Ya'juj and Ma'juj, as Allah says: (and they swoop down from every Hadab.))</p><p>فَيَرْغَبُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، فَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَغَفًا فِي رِقَابِهِمْ فَيُصْبِحُونَ فَرْسَى كَمَوْتِ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ، فَيَهْبِطُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ فَلَا يَجِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بَيْتًا إِلَّا قَدْ مَلَأَهُ زَهَمُهُمْ وَنَتَنُهُمْ، فَيَرْغَبُ عِيسَى وَأَصْحَابُهُ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ،فَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا كَأَعْنَاقِ الْبُخْتِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُمْ فَتَطْرَحُهُمْ حَيْثُ شَاءَ الله»</p><p>(`Isa and his companions will beseech Allah, and Allah will send against them insects which will attack their necks, and in the morning they will all perish as one. Then `Isa and his companions will come down and they will not find a single spot on earth that is free from their putrefaction and stench. Then `Isa and his companions will again beseech Allah, and He will send birds with necks like those of Bactrian camels, and they will carry them and throw them wherever Allah wills.) Ibn Jabir said: \"`Ata' bin Yazid As-Saksaki told me, from Ka`b or someone else: `They will throw them into Al-Mahbal.' Ibn Jabir said: \"I said, `O Abu Yazid, and where is Al-Mahbal\" He said, \"In the east (where the sun rises).\" He said:</p><p>«وَيُرْسِلُ اللهُ مَطَرًا لَا يَكُنُّ مِنْهُ بَيْتُ مَدَرٍ وَلَا وَبَرٍ أَرْبَعِينَ يَوْمًا، فَيَغْسِلُ الْأَرْضَ حَتَّى يَتْرُكَهَا كَالزَّلَفَةِ، وَيُقَالُ لِلْأَرْضِ: أَنْبِتِي ثَمَرَكِ وَرُدِّي بَرَكَتَكِ، قَالَ: فَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَأْكُلُ النَّفَرُ مِنَ الرُّمَّانَةِ فَيَسْتَظِلُّونَ بِقِحْفِهَا، وَيُبَارَكُ فِي الرِّسْلِ حَتَّى إِنَّ اللِّقْحَةَ مِنَ الْإِبِلِ لَتَكْفِي الْفِئَامَ مِنَ النَّاسِ، وَاللِّقْحَةَ مِنَ الْبَقَرِ تَكْفِي الْفَخِذَ، وَالشَّاةَ مِنَ الْغَنَمِ تَكْفِي أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ، قَالَ: فَبَيْنَمَا هُمْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، إِذْ بَعَثَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ رِيحًا طَيِّبَةً، فَتَأْخُذُهُمْ تَحْتَ آبَاطِهِمْ فَتَقْبِضُ رُوحَ كُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ أَوْ قَالَ: كُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ وَيَبْقَى شِرَارُ النَّاسِ، يَتَهَارَجُونَ تَهَارُجَ الْحُمُرِ، وَعَلَيْهِمْ تَقُومُ السَّاعَة»</p><p>(Then Allah will send rain which no house of clay or (tent of) camel's hair will be able to keep out, for forty days, and the earth will be washed until it looks like a mirror. Then it will be said to the earth: bring forth your fruit and restore your blessing. On that day a group of people will be able to eat from one pomegranate and seek shade under its skin, and everything will be blessed. A milch-camel will give so much milk that it will be sufficient for a whole group of people, and a milch-cow will give so much milk that it will be sufficient for a whole clan, and a sheep will be sufficient for an entire household. At that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will reach beneath their armpits and will take the soul of every Muslim -- or every believer -- and there will be left only the most evil of people who will commit fornication like mules, and then the Hour will come upon them.)\" This was also recorded by Muslim but not by Al-Bukhari. It was also recorded by the Sunan compilers, with different chains of narrators. At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\" The Third Hadith Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn Harmalah, from his maternal aunt who said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave a Khutbah, and he had a bandage on his finger where he had been stung by a scorpion. He said:</p><p>«إِنَّكُمْ تَقُولُونَ: لَا عَدُوَّ لَكُمْ، وَإِنَّكُمْ لَا تَزَالُونَ تُقَاتِلُونَ عَدُوًّا، حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ: عِرَاضَ الْوُجُوهِ، صِغَارَ الْعُيُونِ، صُهْبَ الشِّعَافِ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنْسِلُونَ كَأَنَّ وُجُوهَهُمُ الْمَجَانُّ الْمُطْرَقَة»</p><p>(You say that you have no enemy, but you will keep fighting your enemies until Ya'juj and Ma'juj come, with their wide faces, small eyes and reddish hair, pouring down from every mound with their faces looking like burnished shields.)\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a Hadith of Muhammad bin `Amr from Khalid bin `Abdullah bin Harmalah Al-Mudlaji, from his paternal aunt, from the Prophet , and he mentioned something similar. It was confimred by Hadiths that `Isa bin Maryam will perform Hajj to the Al-Bayt Al-`Atiq (i.e., the Ka`bah). Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَيُحَجَّنَّ هَذَا الْبَيْتُ وَلَيُعْتَمَرَنَّ بَعْدَ خُرُوجِ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوج»</p><p>(He will certainly come to this House and perform Hajj and `Umrah, after the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p><p>وَاقْتَرَبَ الْوَعْدُ الْحَقُّ</p><p>(And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near.) the Day of Resurrection, when these terrors and earthquakes and this chaos will come to pass. The Hour has drawn nigh and when it comes to pass, the disbelievers will say: \"This is a difficult Day.\" Allah says:</p><p>فَإِذَا هِىَ شَـخِصَةٌ أَبْصَـرُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(Then, you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly staring in horror.) because of the horror of the tremendous events that they are witnessing.</p><p>يوَيْلَنَآ</p><p>(Woe to us!) means, they will say, `Woe to us!'</p><p>قَدْ كُنَّا فِى غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـذَا</p><p>(We were indeed heedless of this) means, in the world.</p><p>بَلْ كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ</p><p>(nay, but we were wrongdoers.) they will admit their wrong- doing at the time when that will not help them at all.</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p>",
    "<h2>The Idolators and their gods are Fuel for Hell</h2><p>Allah says to the people of Makkah, the idolators of the Quraysh and those who followed their religion of idol worship:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Kindling.\" This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(whose fuel is men and stones) 66:6. According to another report, Ibn `Abbas said:</p><p>حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Hasab for Hell) means firewood in (the dialect of the people of) Zanjiyyah. Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah said: \"Its fuel.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"The fuel of Hell means that which is thrown into it.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>((Surely) you will enter it.) means, you will go into it.</p><p>لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا</p><p>(Had these been gods, they would not have entered there,) means, if these idols and false gods which you worshipped instead of Allah, had really been gods, they would not have entered the Hellfire.</p><p>وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(and all of them will abide therein forever.) means, the worshippers and the objects of their worship will all abide therein forever.</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ</p><p>(Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ</p><p>(they will have (in the Fire), Zafir and Shahiq) 11:106. Zafir refers to their exhalation, and Shahiq refers to their inhalation.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.)</p><h2>The State of the Blessed</h2><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us,) `Ikrimah said, \"Mercy.\" Others said it means being blessed.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom.) When Allah mentions the people of Hell and their punishment for their associating others in worship with Allah, He follows that with a description of the blessed who believed in Allah and His Messengers. These are the ones for whom the blessing has preceded from Allah, and they did righteous deeds in the world, as Allah says:</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is the best reward and even more) 10:26</p><p>هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ</p><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) 55:60 Just as they did good in this world, Allah will make their final destiny and their reward good; He will save them from punishment and give them a great reward.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom. They shall not hear the slightest sound of it,) means, they will not feel its heat in their bodies.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) means, they will be safe from that which they fear, and they will have all that they love and desire. It was said that this was revealed to point out an exception in the case of those who are worshipped instead of Allah, and to exclude `Uzayr and the Messiah from their number. Hajjaj bin Muhammad Al-A`war reported from Ibn Jurayj, and `Uthman bin `Ata' reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Then He made an exception and said:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us.) It was said that this referred to the angels and `Isa, and others who are worshipped instead of Allah. This was the view of `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and Ibn Jurayj. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his book of Sirah: \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men of Quraysh in the Masjid. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Until His Statement,</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari As-Sahmi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari, \"By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.\" `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said: \"By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship Al-Masih, `Isa bin Maryam.\" Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ، فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، إِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to be worshipped instead of Allah will be with the ones who worshipped him, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whoever told them to worship him.) Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ - لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell). They shall not hear the slightest sound of it (Hell), while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) It was revealed about the mention of `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who had spent their lives in devotion towards Allah, but the misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten children. \" Glory to Him! They are but honored slaves). Until His saying,</p><p>وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّى إِلَـهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ فَذلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And if any of them should say: \"Verily, I am a god besides Him,\" such a one We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.) 21:26-29. Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped alongside Allah, and the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument of `Abdullah bin Az-Zab'ari, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ - وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ - إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud (laugh out at the example). And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\" They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people. He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he shall be a known sign for the Hour. Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) 43:57-61 meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour,</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me (Allah)! This is the straight path) 43:63.\" What Ibn Az-Zab`ari said was a serious mistake, because the Ayah was addressed to the people of Makkah concerning their worship of idols which were inanimate and could not think. It was a rebuke for their worship of them, so Allah said:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!) How could this be applied to Al-Masih, `Uzayr and others who did righteous deeds and did not accept the worship of those who worshipped them</p><p>لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ</p><p>(The greatest terror will not grieve them,) It was said that this means death, as was narrated by `Abdur-Razzaq from Yahya bin Rabi`ah from `Ata.' Or it was said that the greatest terror refers to the blast of the Trumpet, as Al-`Awfi said narrating from Ibn `Abbas and Abu Sinan, Sa`id bin Sinan Ash-Shaybani. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir.</p><p>وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, the angels will greet them on the Day of Resurrection when they emerge from their graves with the words:</p><p>هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(\"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, hope for the best.</p>",
    "<h2>The Idolators and their gods are Fuel for Hell</h2><p>Allah says to the people of Makkah, the idolators of the Quraysh and those who followed their religion of idol worship:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Kindling.\" This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(whose fuel is men and stones) 66:6. According to another report, Ibn `Abbas said:</p><p>حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Hasab for Hell) means firewood in (the dialect of the people of) Zanjiyyah. Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah said: \"Its fuel.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"The fuel of Hell means that which is thrown into it.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>((Surely) you will enter it.) means, you will go into it.</p><p>لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا</p><p>(Had these been gods, they would not have entered there,) means, if these idols and false gods which you worshipped instead of Allah, had really been gods, they would not have entered the Hellfire.</p><p>وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(and all of them will abide therein forever.) means, the worshippers and the objects of their worship will all abide therein forever.</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ</p><p>(Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ</p><p>(they will have (in the Fire), Zafir and Shahiq) 11:106. Zafir refers to their exhalation, and Shahiq refers to their inhalation.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.)</p><h2>The State of the Blessed</h2><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us,) `Ikrimah said, \"Mercy.\" Others said it means being blessed.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom.) When Allah mentions the people of Hell and their punishment for their associating others in worship with Allah, He follows that with a description of the blessed who believed in Allah and His Messengers. These are the ones for whom the blessing has preceded from Allah, and they did righteous deeds in the world, as Allah says:</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is the best reward and even more) 10:26</p><p>هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ</p><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) 55:60 Just as they did good in this world, Allah will make their final destiny and their reward good; He will save them from punishment and give them a great reward.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom.

Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship Al-Masih, `Isa bin Maryam.\" Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ، فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، إِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to be worshipped instead of Allah will be with the ones who worshipped him, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whoever told them to worship him.) Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ - لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell). They shall not hear the slightest sound of it (Hell), while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) It was revealed about the mention of `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who had spent their lives in devotion towards Allah, but the misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten children. \" Glory to Him! They are but honored slaves). Until His saying,</p><p>وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّى إِلَـهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ فَذلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And if any of them should say: \"Verily, I am a god besides Him,\" such a one We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.) 21:26-29. Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped alongside Allah, and the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument of `Abdullah bin Az-Zab'ari, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ - وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ - إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud (laugh out at the example). And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\" They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people. He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he shall be a known sign for the Hour. Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) 43:57-61 meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour,</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me (Allah)! This is the straight path) 43:63.\" What Ibn Az-Zab`ari said was a serious mistake, because the Ayah was addressed to the people of Makkah concerning their worship of idols which were inanimate and could not think. It was a rebuke for their worship of them, so Allah said:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!) How could this be applied to Al-Masih, `Uzayr and others who did righteous deeds and did not accept the worship of those who worshipped them</p><p>لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ</p><p>(The greatest terror will not grieve them,) It was said that this means death, as was narrated by `Abdur-Razzaq from Yahya bin Rabi`ah from `Ata.' Or it was said that the greatest terror refers to the blast of the Trumpet, as Al-`Awfi said narrating from Ibn `Abbas and Abu Sinan, Sa`id bin Sinan Ash-Shaybani. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir.</p><p>وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, the angels will greet them on the Day of Resurrection when they emerge from their graves with the words:</p><p>هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(\"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, hope for the best.</p>",
    "<h2>The Idolators and their gods are Fuel for Hell</h2><p>Allah says to the people of Makkah, the idolators of the Quraysh and those who followed their religion of idol worship:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Kindling.\" This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(whose fuel is men and stones) 66:6. According to another report, Ibn `Abbas said:</p><p>حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Hasab for Hell) means firewood in (the dialect of the people of) Zanjiyyah. Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah said: \"Its fuel.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"The fuel of Hell means that which is thrown into it.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>((Surely) you will enter it.) means, you will go into it.</p><p>لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا</p><p>(Had these been gods, they would not have entered there,) means, if these idols and false gods which you worshipped instead of Allah, had really been gods, they would not have entered the Hellfire.</p><p>وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(and all of them will abide therein forever.) means, the worshippers and the objects of their worship will all abide therein forever.</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ</p><p>(Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ</p><p>(they will have (in the Fire), Zafir and Shahiq) 11:106. Zafir refers to their exhalation, and Shahiq refers to their inhalation.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.)</p><h2>The State of the Blessed</h2><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us,) `Ikrimah said, \"Mercy.\" Others said it means being blessed.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom.) When Allah mentions the people of Hell and their punishment for their associating others in worship with Allah, He follows that with a description of the blessed who believed in Allah and His Messengers. These are the ones for whom the blessing has preceded from Allah, and they did righteous deeds in the world, as Allah says:</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is the best reward and even more) 10:26</p><p>هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ</p><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) 55:60 Just as they did good in this world, Allah will make their final destiny and their reward good; He will save them from punishment and give them a great reward.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom. They shall not hear the slightest sound of it,) means, they will not feel its heat in their bodies.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) means, they will be safe from that which they fear, and they will have all that they love and desire. It was said that this was revealed to point out an exception in the case of those who are worshipped instead of Allah, and to exclude `Uzayr and the Messiah from their number. Hajjaj bin Muhammad Al-A`war reported from Ibn Jurayj, and `Uthman bin `Ata' reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Then He made an exception and said:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us.) It was said that this referred to the angels and `Isa, and others who are worshipped instead of Allah. This was the view of `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and Ibn Jurayj. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his book of Sirah: \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men of Quraysh in the Masjid. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Until His Statement,</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari As-Sahmi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari, \"By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument.

Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped alongside Allah, and the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument of `Abdullah bin Az-Zab'ari, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ - وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ - إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud (laugh out at the example). And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\" They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people. He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he shall be a known sign for the Hour. Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) 43:57-61 meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour,</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me (Allah)! This is the straight path) 43:63.\" What Ibn Az-Zab`ari said was a serious mistake, because the Ayah was addressed to the people of Makkah concerning their worship of idols which were inanimate and could not think. It was a rebuke for their worship of them, so Allah said:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!) How could this be applied to Al-Masih, `Uzayr and others who did righteous deeds and did not accept the worship of those who worshipped them</p><p>لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ</p><p>(The greatest terror will not grieve them,) It was said that this means death, as was narrated by `Abdur-Razzaq from Yahya bin Rabi`ah from `Ata.' Or it was said that the greatest terror refers to the blast of the Trumpet, as Al-`Awfi said narrating from Ibn `Abbas and Abu Sinan, Sa`id bin Sinan Ash-Shaybani. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir.</p><p>وَتَتَلَقَّـهُمُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(and the angels will meet them, (with the greeting:) \"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, the angels will greet them on the Day of Resurrection when they emerge from their graves with the words:</p><p>هَـذَا يَوْمُكُمُ الَّذِى كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(\"This is your Day which you were promised\".) meaning, hope for the best.</p>",
    "<h2>The Idolators and their gods are Fuel for Hell</h2><p>Allah says to the people of Makkah, the idolators of the Quraysh and those who followed their religion of idol worship:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Kindling.\" This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p>(whose fuel is men and stones) 66:6. According to another report, Ibn `Abbas said:</p><p>حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Hasab for Hell) means firewood in (the dialect of the people of) Zanjiyyah. Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah said: \"Its fuel.\" Ad-Dahhak said: \"The fuel of Hell means that which is thrown into it.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>((Surely) you will enter it.) means, you will go into it.</p><p>لَوْ كَانَ هَـؤُلاءِ ءَالِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا</p><p>(Had these been gods, they would not have entered there,) means, if these idols and false gods which you worshipped instead of Allah, had really been gods, they would not have entered the Hellfire.</p><p>وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(and all of them will abide therein forever.) means, the worshippers and the objects of their worship will all abide therein forever.</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ</p><p>(Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ</p><p>(they will have (in the Fire), Zafir and Shahiq) 11:106. Zafir refers to their exhalation, and Shahiq refers to their inhalation.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.)</p><h2>The State of the Blessed</h2><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us,) `Ikrimah said, \"Mercy.\" Others said it means being blessed.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom.) When Allah mentions the people of Hell and their punishment for their associating others in worship with Allah, He follows that with a description of the blessed who believed in Allah and His Messengers. These are the ones for whom the blessing has preceded from Allah, and they did righteous deeds in the world, as Allah says:</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is the best reward and even more) 10:26</p><p>هَلْ جَزَآءُ الإِحْسَـنِ إِلاَّ الإِحْسَـنُ</p><p>(Is there any reward for good other than good) 55:60 Just as they did good in this world, Allah will make their final destiny and their reward good; He will save them from punishment and give them a great reward.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا</p><p>(they will be removed far therefrom. They shall not hear the slightest sound of it,) means, they will not feel its heat in their bodies.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) means, they will be safe from that which they fear, and they will have all that they love and desire. It was said that this was revealed to point out an exception in the case of those who are worshipped instead of Allah, and to exclude `Uzayr and the Messiah from their number. Hajjaj bin Muhammad Al-A`war reported from Ibn Jurayj, and `Uthman bin `Ata' reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Then He made an exception and said:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us.) It was said that this referred to the angels and `Isa, and others who are worshipped instead of Allah. This was the view of `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and Ibn Jurayj. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his book of Sirah: \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men of Quraysh in the Masjid. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) Until His Statement,</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</p><p>(and therein they will hear not.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari As-Sahmi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari, \"By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.\" `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said: \"By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship Al-Masih, `Isa bin Maryam.\" Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ، فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، إِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to be worshipped instead of Allah will be with the ones who worshipped him, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whoever told them to worship him.) Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ - لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيَسَهَا وَهُمْ فِى مَا اشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell). They shall not hear the slightest sound of it (Hell), while they abide in that which their own selves desire.) It was revealed about the mention of `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who had spent their lives in devotion towards Allah, but the misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten children. \" Glory to Him! They are but honored slaves). Until His saying,</p><p>وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّى إِلَـهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ فَذلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And if any of them should say: \"Verily, I am a god besides Him,\" such a one We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.) 21:26-29. Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped alongside Allah, and the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument of `Abdullah bin Az-Zab'ari, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ - وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ - إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud (laugh out at the example).

We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.

It was a rebuke for their worship of them, so Allah said:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) Hasab for Hell!) How could this be applied to Al-Masih, `Uzayr and others who did righteous deeds and did not accept the worship of those who worshipped them</p><p>لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ الْفَزَعُ الاٌّكْبَرُ</p><p>(The greatest terror will not grieve them,) It was said that this means death, as was narrated by `Abdur-Razzaq from Yahya bin Rabi`ah from `Ata.'

    "<h2>The Heavens will be rolled up on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah says: this will happen on the Day of Resurrection:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَطْوِى السَّمَآءَ كَطَىِّ السِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ</p><p>(And (remember) the Day when We shall roll up the heaven like a Sijill for books.) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَا قَدَرُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ وَالاٌّرْضُ جَمِيعـاً قَبْضَـتُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ مَطْوِيَّـتٌ بِيَمِينِهِ سُبْحَـنَهُ وَتَعَالَى عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!) 39:67 Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi` reported from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ يَقْبِضُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الْأَرَضِينَ وَتَكُونُ السَّمَوَاتُ بِيَمِينِه»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will seize the earth and the heavens will be in His Right Hand.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him.</p><p>كَطَىِّ السِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ</p><p>(like a Sijill rolled up for books.) What is meant by Sijill is book. As-Suddi said concerning this Ayah: \"As-Sijill is an angel who is entrusted with the records; when a person dies, his Book (of deeds) is taken up to As-Sijill, and he rolls it up and puts it away until the Day of Resurrection.\" But the correct view as narrated from Ibn `Abbas is that As-Sijill refers to the record (of deeds). This was also reported from him by `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi. This was also stated by Mujahid, Qatadah and others. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, because this usage is well-known in the (Arabic) language. Based on the above, the meaning is: the Day when the heaven will be rolled up like a scroll. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ</p><p>(Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the will of Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead.) 37:103 There are many more linguistic examples in this respect. Allah knows best.</p><p>كَمَا بَدَأْنَآ أَوَّلَ خَلْقٍ نُّعِيدُهُ وَعْداً عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ</p><p>(As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.) means, this will inevitably come to pass on the Day when Allah creates His creation anew. As He created them in the first place, He is surely able to re-create them. This must inevitably come to pass because it is one of the things that Allah has promised, and He does not break His promise. He is able to do that. Because He says:</p><p>إِنَّا كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ</p><p>(Truly, We shall do it.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood among us exhorting us, and said:</p><p>«إِنَّكُمْ مَحْشُورُونَ إِلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ حُفَاةً عُرَاةً غُرْلًا، كَمَا بَدَأْنَا أَوَّلَ خَلْقٍ نُعِيدُهُ وَعْدًا عَلَيْنَا، إِنَّا كُنَّا فَاعِلِين»</p><p>(You will be gathered before Allah barefoot, naked and uncircumcised. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.) And he mentioned the entire Hadith. It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs, and Al-Bukhari mentioned it in his Tafsir of this Ayah.</p>",
    "<h2>The Earth will be inherited by the Righteous</h2><p>Allah tells us of His decree for His righteous servants who are the blessed in this world and in the Hereafter, those who will inherit the earth in this world and in the Hereafter. As Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ الأَرْضَ للَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, the earth is Allah's. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His servants; and the (blessed) end is for those who have Taqwa.) 7:128</p><p>إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الاٌّشْهَـدُ</p><p>(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth.) 40:51</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ</p><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them) 24:55. Allah tells us that this is recorded in the Books of Divine Laws and Decrees, and that it will inevitably come to pass. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ</p><p>(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr) Al-A`mash said: \"I asked Sa`id bin Jubayr about the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ</p><p>(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after Adh-Dhikr). He said: `Az-Zabur means the Tawrah, the Injil and the Qur'an.\"' Mujahid said, \"Az-Zabur means the Book.\" Ibn `Abbas, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said, \"Az-Zabur is that which was revealed to Dawud, and Adh-Dhikr is the Tawrah.\" Mujahid said: \"Az-Zabur means the Books which came after Adh-Dhikr, and Adh-Dhikr is the Mother of the Book (Umm Al-Kitab) which is with Allah.\" This was also the view of Zayd bin Aslam: \"It is the First Book.\" Ath-Thawri said: \"It is Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz.\"</p><p>أَنَّ الاٌّرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ الصَّـلِحُونَ</p><p>(that My righteous servants shall inherit the land.) Mujahid said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means, the land of Paradise.\" This was also the view of Abu `Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Abu Salih, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ath-Thawri (may Allah have mercy on them).</p><p>إِنَّ فِى هَـذَا لَبَلَـغاً لِّقَوْمٍ عَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(Verily, in this (the Qur'an) there is a plain Message for people who worship Allah.) means, `in this Qur'an which We have revealed to Our servant Muhammad , there is a plain Message which is beneficial and is sufficient for a people who worship Allah.' This refers to those who worship Allah in the manner which He has prescribed and which He loves and is pleased with, and they would rather obey Allah than follow the Shaytan or their own desires.</p><h2>Muhammad ﷺ is a Mercy to the Worlds</h2><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـكَ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And We have sent you not but as a mercy for the `Alamin.) Here Allah tells us that He has made Muhammad ﷺ a mercy to the `Alamin, i.e., He sent him as a mercy for all of them peoples, so whoever accepts this mercy and gives thanks for this blessing, will be happy in this world and in the Hereafter. But whoever rejects it and denies it, will lose out in this world and in the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ بَدَّلُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ كُفْرًا وَأَحَلُّواْ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ الْبَوَارِ - جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا وَبِئْسَ الْقَرَارُ</p><p>(Have you not seen those who have changed the blessings of Allah into disbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction Hell, in which they will burn, -- and what an evil place to settle in!) 14:28-29 And Allah says, describing the Qur'an:</p><p>قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُوْلَـئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away.\") 41:44 Muslim reports in his Sahih: Ibn Abi `Umar told us, Marwan Al-Fazari told us, from Yazid bin Kisan, from Ibn Abi Hazim that Abu Hurayrah said that it was said, \"O Messenger of Allah, pray against the idolators.\" He said:</p><p>«إِنِّي لَمْ أُبْعَثْ لَعَّانًا، وَإِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ رَحْمَة»</p><p>(I was not sent as a curse, rather I was sent as a mercy.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Abi Qurrah Al-Kindi said: \"Hudhayfah was in Al-Mada'in and he was mentioning things that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had said. Hudhayfah came to Salman and Salman said: `O Hudhayfah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would sometimes be angry and would speak accordingly, and would sometimes be pleased and would speak accordingly.

It may be asked: what kind of mercy do those who disbelieve in him get The answer is what Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـكَ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(And We have sent you not but as a mercy for the `Alamin. ) He said, \"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, mercy will be decreed for him in this world and in the Hereafter; whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, will be protected from that which happened to the nations of earthquakes and stoning.\"</p>",

They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he the narrator said, \"I do not know if he said two-thirds or not.\" This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad. Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ</p><p>وَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change. The Prophet said:</p><p>«مِنْ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، وَمِنْكُمْ وَاحِدٌ، أَنْتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَالشَّعْرَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَبْيَضِ، أَوْ كَالشَّعْرَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَسْوَدِ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: شَطْرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَكَبَّرْنا»</p><p>(Nine hundred and ninety-nine from Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and one from you.

We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir.

Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ</p><p>وَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change. The Prophet said:</p><p>«مِنْ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، وَمِنْكُمْ وَاحِدٌ، أَنْتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَالشَّعْرَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَبْيَضِ، أَوْ كَالشَّعْرَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَسْوَدِ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: شَطْرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَكَبَّرْنا»</p><p>(Nine hundred and ninety-nine from Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and one from you. Among mankind you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or a white hair on the side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise.) We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.</p><p>إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event. This earthquake is what will happen to people when they are filled with terror, as Allah says:</p><p>هُنَالِكَ ابْتُلِىَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً</p><p>(There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking.) 33:11. Then Allah says:</p><p>يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ</p><p>(The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling,) means, she will be distracted by the horror of what she is seeing, which will make her forget the one who is the dearest of all to her and to whom she shows the most compassion. Her shock will make her neglect her infant at the very moment of breastfeeding, Allah says,</p><p>كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ</p><p>(every nursing mother), and He did not say a mother who has an infant of breastfeeding age.</p><p>عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ</p><p>(her nursling) means, her nursing infant that has not yet been weaned.</p><p>وَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا</p><p>(and every pregnant one will drop her load,) means, before the pre- gnancy has reached full term, because of the intensity of the horror.</p><p>وَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى</p><p>(and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state,) means, because of the severity of their situa- tion, when they will lose their minds, so that whoever sees them, will think, that they are drunk,</p><p>وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)</p>",
    "<h2>Condemnation of the Followers of the Shaytan</h2>\t\t\t\tAllah condemns those who deny the Resurrection and who deny that Allah is able to restore life to the dead, those who turn away from that which Allah has revealed to His Prophets and, in their views -- denial and disbelief -- follow every rebellious Shaytan among men and Jinn.

Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members.

    "<h2>Evidence of the Resurrection in the creation of Man and of Plants</h2><p>When Allah speaks of disbelief in the Resurrection, He also mentions the evidence of His power and ability to resurrect that is evident from the way He initiates creation. Allah says:</p><p>يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ</p><p>(O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection,) which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ</p><p>(then verily, We have created you from dust,) meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from.</p><p>ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ</p><p>(then from a Nutfah,) 32:8 meaning, then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.</p><h2>The Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb</h2><p>ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ</p><p>(then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh) if the Nutfah establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ</p><p>(then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed) meaning, as you see.</p><p>لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِى الاٌّرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى</p><p>(that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term,) meaning that sometimes the fetus remains in the womb and is not miscarried.</p><p>مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ</p><p>(some formed and some unformed, ) Mujahid said, \"This means the miscarried fetus, formed or unformed. When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.\" It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us:</p><p>«إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ، ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُؤْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ: بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ، وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح»</p><p>(Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.)\"</p><h2>Man's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;</h2><p>ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً</p><p>(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ</p><p>(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.</p><p>وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى</p><p>(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.</p><p>وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ</p><p>(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:</p><p>لِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً</p><p>(so that he knows nothing after having known.)</p><p>اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ</p><p>(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) 30:54</p><h2>Another Parable of the Resurrection from Plants</h2><p>وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ هَامِدَةً</p><p>(And you see the earth Hamidatan,) This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. Qatadah said, \"(This means) the eroded, dusty earth.\" As-Suddi said, \"Dead.\"</p><p>فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ</p><p>(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. Allah says:</p><p>وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ</p><p>(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.</p><p>ذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ</p><p>(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى</p><p>(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39</p><p>إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" -- and it is!) 36:82.</p><p>وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا</p><p>(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.</p><p>وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ</p><p>(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.</p><p>وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ</p><p>قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ</p><p>(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation.

The meaning is: whoever thinks that Allah will not support Muhammad ﷺ and His Book and His Religion, let him go and kill himself if it annoys him so much. For Allah will most certainly help and support him.

Allah will</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ</div><p>(judge between them on the Day of Resurrection) with justice; He will admit those who believed in Him to Paradise and will send those who disbelieved in Him to Hell, for He is a Witness over their deeds, and He knows all that they say and all that they do in secret, and conceal in their breast.</p>",
    "<h2>Everything prostrates to Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us that He alone, with no partner or associate, is deserving of worship. Everything prostrates to His might, willingly or unwillingly, and everything prostrates in a manner that befits its nature, as Allah says:</p><p>أَوَ لَمْيَرَوْاْ إِلَىخَلَقَ اللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ يَتَفَيَّأُ ظِلَـلُهُ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَالْشَّمَآئِلِ سُجَّدًا لِلَّهِ وَهُمْ</p><p>(Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly) 16:48. And Allah says here:</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(See you not that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth prostrate themselves to Him) means, the angels in the regions of the heavens, and all the living creatures, men, Jinn, animals and birds.</p><p>وَإِن مِّن شَىْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدَهِ</p><p>(and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise) 17:44.</p><p>وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ</p><p>(and the sun, and the moon, and the stars,) These are mentioned by name, because they are worshipped instead of Allah, so Allah explains that they too prostrate to their Creator and that they are subjected to Him.</p><p>لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُنَّ</p><p>(Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them) 41:37. In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Abu Dharr said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me,</p><p>«أَتَدْرِي أَيْنَ تَذْهَبُ هَذِهِ الشَّمْسُ؟»</p><p>(Do you know where this sun goes) I said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said,</p><p>«فَإِنَّهَا تَذْهَبُ فَتَسْجُدُ تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ، ثُمَّ تَسْتَأْمِرُ فَيُوشِكُ أَنْ يُقَالَ لَهَا: ارْجِعِي مِنْ حَيْثُ جِئْت»</p><p>(It goes (sets) and prostrates beneath the Throne, then it awaits the command. Soon it will be told, \"Go back the way whence you came.\")\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"A man came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I saw myself in a dream last night, as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated, and the tree prostrated when I did, and I heard it saying, \"O Allah, write down a reward for me for that, and remove a sin from me for that, store it with You for me and accept it from me as You accepted from Your servant Dawud.\"' Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited an Ayah mentioning a prostration, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had told him the tree said.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban in his Sahih.</p><p>وَالدَّوَآبِّ</p><p>(Ad-Dawabb) means all the animals. It was reported in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade using the backs of animals as platforms for speaking, for, perhaps the one who was being ridden was better and remembered Allah more than the one who was riding.</p><p>وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنَ النَّاسِ</p><p>(and many of mankind) means, they prostrate willingly, submitting themselves to Allah of their own free will.</p><p>وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ الْعَذَابُ</p><p>(But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.) means, those who refuse prostration, are stubborn and arrogant.</p><p>وَمَن يُهِنِ اللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّكْرِمٍ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ</p><p>(And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honor him. Verily, Allah does what He wills.) It was recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا قَرَأَ ابْنُ آدَمَ السَّجْدَةَ اعْتَزَلَ الشَّيْطَانُ يَبْكِي، يَقُولُ: يَا وَيْلَهُ أُمِرَ ابْنُ آدَمَ بِالسُّجُودِ فَسَجَدَ فَلَهُ الْجَنَّةُ، وَأُمِرْتُ بِالسُّجُودِ فَأَبَيْتُ فَلِيَ النَّار»</p><p>(When the son of Adam recites the Ayat containing the prostration, the Shaytan withdraws weeping and says, \"Ah! Woe (to me)! the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate and he prostrated, so Paradise is his; I was commanded to prostrate and I refused, so I am doomed to Hell.\") This was recorded by Muslim. In his book Al-Marasil, Abu Dawud recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan, may Allah have mercy upon him, reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْقُرْآنِ بِسَجْدَتَيْن»</p><p>(Surat Al-Hajj has been favored over the rest of the Qur'an with two prostrations.\") Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Isma`ili recorded from Abu Al-Jahm that `Umar did the two prostrations of Surat Al-Hajj when he was in Al-Jabiyah, and he said, \"This Surah has been favored with two prostrations.\"</p>",
    "<h2>The Reason for Revelation</h2><p>It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Dharr swore that this Ayah --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ</div><p>(These two opponents dispute with each other about their Lord;) was revealed concerning Hamzah and his two companions, and `Utbah and his two companions, on the day of Badr when they came forward to engage in single combat. This is the wording of Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah. Then Al-Bukhari recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"I will be the first one to kneel down before the Most Merciful so that the dispute may be settled on the Day of Resurrection.\" Qays (sub-narrator) said, \"Concerning them the Ayah was revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَانِ خَصْمَانِ اخْتَصَمُواْ فِى رَبِّهِمْ</div><p>(These two opponents dispute with each other about their Lord;) He (Qays) said, \"They are the ones who came forward (for single combat) on the day of Badr: `Ali, Hamzah and `Ubaydah vs., Shaybah bin Rabi`ah, `Utbah bin Rabi`ah and Al-Walid bin `Utbah.\" This was reported only by Al-Bukhari. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on this Ayah, \"Such as the disbeliever and the believer disputing about the Resurrection.\" According to one report Mujahid and `Ata' commented on this Ayah, \"This refers to the believers and the disbelievers.\" The view of Mujahid and `Ata' that this refers to the disbelievers and the believers, includes all opinions, the story of Badr as well as the others. For the believers want to support the religion of Allah, while the disbelievers want to extinguish the light of faith and to defeat the truth and cause falsehood to prevail. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is good.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Disbelievers</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارِ</div><p>(then as for those who disbelieved, garments of fire will be cut out for them,) meaning, pieces of fire will be prepared for them.

With it will melt (or vanish away) what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins.) meaning, when the boiling water --which is water that has been heated to the ultimate degree- is poured down over their heads. Ibn Jarir recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْحَمِيمَ لَيُصَبُّ عَلَى رُؤُوسِهِمْ فَيَنْفُذُ الْجُمْجُمَةَ حَتَّى يَخْلُصَ إِلَى جَوْفِهِ، فَيَسْلُتَ مَا فِي جَوْفِهِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ قَدَمَيْهِ، وَهُوَ الصِّهْرُ، ثُمَّ يُعَادُ كَمَا كَان»</div><p>(The boiling water will be poured over their heads and will penetrate their skulls until it reaches what is inside, and what is inside will melt until it reaches their feet. This is the melting, then he will be restored to the state he was before.) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said it is Hasan Sahih. This was also recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim, who then recorded that `Abdullah bin As-Sariy said, \"The angel will come to him, carrying the vessel with a pair of tongs because of its heat. When he brings it near to his face, he will shy away from it. He will raise a hammer that he is carrying and will strike his head with it, and his brains will spill out, then he will pour the brains back into his head. This is what Allah says in the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِى بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ </div><p>(With it will melt what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins.)\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ </div><p>(And for them are hooked rods of iron.)

And the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُدُواْ إِلَى صِرَطِ الْحَمِيدِ</div><p>(and they are guided to the path of Him Who is Worthy of all praises.) means, the straight path in this world. These interpretations do not contradict that mentioned above. And Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>A Warning to Those Who hinder Others from the Path of Allah and from Al-Masj id Al-Haram and Who seek to do Evil Actions therein</h2><p>Allah rebukes the disbelievers for preventing the believers from coming to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and performing their rites and rituals there, claiming that they were its guardians,</p><p>وَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ</p><p>(and they are not its guardians. None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa) 8:34. In this Ayah there is proof that it was revealed in Al-Madinah, as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah:</p><p>يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and to drive out its inhabitants) 2:217 And Allah says here:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p>(Verily, those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram) meaning, not only are they disbelievers, but they also hinder people from the path of Allah and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram. They prevent the believers who want to go there from reaching it, although the believers have more right than anyone else to go there. The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p><p>(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah.</p><h2>The Issue of renting Houses in Makkah</h2><p>الَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,</p><p>«وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»</p><p>(Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,</p><p>«لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»</p><p>(A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best.</p><h2>A Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram</h2><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)</p><p>بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you. If a person does this, then he deserves to suffer a painful torment.\"</p><p>بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(or to do wrong,) Mujahid said, \"To do some bad action therein. This is one of the unique features of Al-Haram, that the person who is about to do some evil action should be punished if this is his intention, even if he has not yet commenced the action.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded in his Tafsir that `Abdullah (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud) commented about the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"If a man intends to do some evil action therein, Allah will make him taste a painful torment.\" This was also recorded by Ahmad. I say, its chain is Sahih according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari, and it is more likely Mawquf than Marfu`. And Allah knows best. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent him with two men, one of whom was a Muhajir and the other from among the Ansar. They began to boast about their lineages and `Abdullah bin Unays got angry and killed the Ansari. Then he reverted from Islam (became an apostate) and fled to Makkah. Then these words were revealed concerning him:</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) meaning, whoever flees to Al-Haram to do evil actions, i.e., by leaving Islam.\" These reports indicate some meanings of the phrase \"evil actions\", but the meaning is more general than that and includes things which are more serious. Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,</p><p>تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ</p><p>(Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»</p><p>(This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.)</p>",
    "<h2>Building of the Ka`bah and the Proclamation of the Hajj</h2><p>This is a rebuke to those among Quraysh who worshipped others than Allah and joined partners with Him in the place which from the outset had been established on the basis of Tawhid and the worship of Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. Allah tells us that He showed Ibrahim the site of the `Atiq House, i.e., He guided him to it, entrusted it to him and granted him permission to build it. Many scholars take this as evidence to support their view that Ibrahim was the first one to build the House and that it was not built before his time. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Dharr said, \"I said, `O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, which Masjid was the first to be built' He said,</p><p>«الْمَسْجِدُ الْحَرَام»</p><p>(Al-Masjid Al-Haram.) I said, `Then which' He said,</p><p>«بَيْتُ الْمَقْدِس»</p><p>(Bayt Al-Maqdis.)

Allah says:</p><p>وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</p><p>(and those who bow, and make prostration.) Tawaf and prayer are mentioned together because they are not prescribed together anywhere except in relation to the House. Tawaf is done around the Ka`bah and prayer is offered facing its direction in the majority of cases, with a few exceptions, such as when one is uncertain of the direction of the Qiblah, during battle and when praying optional prayers while traveling. And Allah knows best.</p><p>وَأَذِّن فِى النَّاسِ بِالْحَجِّ</p><p>(And proclaim to mankind the Hajj) meaning, `announce the pilgrimage to mankind and call them to perform pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build.' It was said that Ibrahim said: \"O Lord, how can I convey this to people when my voice will not reach them\" It was said: \"Call them and We will convey it.\" So Ibrahim stood up and said, \"O mankind! Your Lord has established a House so come on pilgrimage to it.\" It is said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice would reach all the regions of the earth, and those who were still in their mothers' wombs and their fathers' loins would hear the call. The response came from everyone in the cities, deserts and countryside, and those whom Allah has decreed will make the pilgrimage, until the Day of Resurrection: \"At Your service, O Allah, at Your service.\" This is a summary of the narrations from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among the Salaf. And Allah knows best. This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and by Ibn Abi Hatim at length.</p><p>يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً وَعَلَى كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ</p><p>(They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel,) This Ayah was used as evidence by those scholars whose view is that Hajj performed on foot by those who are able, is better than Hajj performed riding, because the phrase \"on foot\" is mentioned first, and because it is an indication of their keenness and resolve. Waki` narrated from Abu Al-`Umays from Abu Halhalah from Muhammad bin Ka`b that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I do not regret anything except for the fact that I wish I had performed Hajj on foot, because Allah says,</p><p>يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً</p><p>(They will come to you on foot).\" But the majority are of the view that performing Hajj while riding is better, following the example of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, because he performed Hajj riding, although his physical ability was sound.</p><p>يَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ</p><p>(they will come from every Fajj) means every route, as Allah says:</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً</p><p>(and We placed therein Fijaj for them to pass) 21:31.</p><p>عَميِقٍ</p><p>(`Amiq) means dis- tant.

Hence it says in the Hadith of Al-Bara':</p><p>«إِنَّ الْكَافِرَ إِذَا تَوَفَّتْهُ مَلَائِكَةُ الْمَوْتِ وَصَعِدُوا بِرُوحِهِ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ، فَلَا تُفْتَحُ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ السَّمَاءِ بَلْ تُطْرَحُ رُوحُهُ طَرْحًا مِنْ هُنَاك»</p><p>(When the angels of death take the soul of the disbeliever in death, they take his soul up to the heaven, but the gates of heaven are not opened for him; on the contrary, his soul is thrown down from there.) Then he recited this Ayah. The Hadith has already been quoted in our explanation of Surah Ibrahim. Allah gives another parable of the idolators in Surat Al-An`am, where He says:</p><p>قُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَـبٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى الْهُدَى ائْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَى</p><p>(Say: \"Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor can harm us, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us -- like one whom the Shayaلtin have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): `Come to us.\"' Say: \"Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance.\") 6:71</p>",

    "<h2>The Command to slaughter the Budn (Sacrificial Camel)</h2><p>Here Allah reminds His servants of the blessing which He has bestowed on His servants, by creating the Budn for them and making them one of His symbols. For He has decreed that they should be brought to His Sacred House; indeed, they are the best of that which may be offered as a sacrifice to Allah, as He says:</p><p>لاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ اللَّهِ وَلاَ الشَّهْرَ الْحَرَامَ وَلاَ الْهَدْىَ وَلاَ الْقَلَـئِدَ وَلا ءَامِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ</p><p>(Violate not the sanctity of the Sha`a'ir of Allah, nor of the Sacred Month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlanded people or animals, and others, nor the people coming to the Sacred House)5:2</p><p>وَالْبُدْنَ جَعَلْنَـهَا لَكُمْ مِّن شَعَـئِرِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And the Budn, We have made them for you as among the symbols of Allah,) Ibn Jurayj said: \"Ata' commented on this Ayah, `Cattle and camels.\"' A similar view was also reported from Ibn `Umar, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Mujahid said: \"Al-Budn means camels.\" According to Muslim, Jabir bin `Abdullah and others said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded us to share in offering the sacrifice, a Budn (camel) for seven people, and one cow for seven people.\"</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ</p><p>(wherein you have much good. ) means, reward in the Hereafter.</p><p>فَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ</p><p>(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice).) It was reported from Al-Muttalib bin `Abdullah bin Hantab that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"I prayed with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on `Id Al-Adha. When he finished, he brought a ram and slaughtered it, saying,</p><p>«بِاسْمِ اللهِ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنِّي وَعَمَّنْ لَمْ يُضَحِّ مِنْ أُمَّتِي»</p><p>(Bismillah, and Allahu Akbar. O Allah, this is on behalf of me and anyone of my Ummah who has not offered a sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Yazid bin Abi Habib from Ibn `Abbas that Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two rams on the day of `Id, and when he lay them down to sacrifice them, he said:</p><p>«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ مِنْكَ وَلَكَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأُمَّتِه»</p><p>(I turn my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, being true and sincere in faith submitting myself to Him Alone, and I am not of the idolators. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists for, with no partner or associate for Him. Thus am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O Allah, from You and to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his Ummah.) Then he said, `Bismillah' and `Allahu Akbar' and slaughtered them.\" It was reported from `Ali bin Al-Husayn from Abu Rafi` that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wanted to offer a sacrifice, he would buy two fat, horned, fine rams. When he had prayed and addressed the people, he would bring one of them to where he was standing in the prayer place, and would sacrifice it himself with a knife, then he would say:</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنْ أُمَّتِي جَمِيعِهَا: مَنْ شَهِدَ لَكَ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لِي بِالْبَلَاغ»</p><p>(O Allah, this is on behalf of all of my Ummah, whoever bears witness of Tawhid of You and bears witness that I have conveyed.) Then he would bring the other ram and sacrifice it himself, and say,</p><p>«هَذَا عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّد»</p><p>(This is on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.) He would give them to the poor and he and his family would eat from it as well. This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Zabiyan from Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>فَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ</p><p>(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). ) \"When they are standing on three legs, with the left foreleg tied up. He says Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah, Allahumma Minka wa Laka (In the Name of Allah and Allah is Most Great; there is no God but Allah. O Allah, from You and to You).\" In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Umar came to a man who had made his camel kneel down in order to sacrifice it. He said, \"Make it stand up fettered, (this is) the Sunnah of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\"</p><p>فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</p><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"This means, when it has fallen to the ground.\" This was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and a similar view was narrated from Muqatil bin Hayyan. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p><p>فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</p><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) \"Meaning, when they have died.\" This is what was meant by the comment of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid, for it is not permitted to eat from the sacrifice when it has been slaughtered until it has died and its movements have ceased. It was reported in a Marfu` Hadith:</p><p>«لَا تُعَجِّلُوا النُّفُوسَ أَنْ تَزْهَق»</p><p>(Do not rush until you are sure that the animal is dead. ) Ath-Thawri narrated in his Jami` that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that, and he supported it with the Hadith of Shaddad bin `Aws in Sahih Muslim:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَه»</p><p>(Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. If you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.) It was recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا قُطِعَ مِنَ الْبَهِيمَةِ وَهِيَ حَيَّةٌ فَهُوَ مَيْتَة»</p><p>(Whatever is cut from an animal while it is still alive is Maytah (dead flesh).) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</p><p>(eat thereof, and feed Qani` and the Mu`tarr...) This is a command which implies that this is permissible. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is content with what he is given and he stays in his house, and the Mu`tarr is the one who comes to you and rubs shoulders with you so that you will give him some meat, but he does not ask for it. \" This was also the view of Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is too proud to ask, and Mu`tarr is the one who does ask.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mujahid, according to one report narrated from him. And the opposite was also suggested. This Ayah has been quoted as evidence by those scholars who said that the sacrifice should be divided into three: a third for the one who offers the sacrifice to eat from, a third to be given as gifts to his friends, and a third to be given in charity to the poor, because Allah says:</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</p><p>(eat thereof, and feed the poor who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.) But there is no evidence in this Ayah for this view. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people: c</p><p>«إِنِّي كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنِ ادِّخَارِ لُحُومِ الْأَضَاحِي فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا مَا بَدَا لَكُم»</p><p>(I used to forbid you to keep the meat of the sacrifice for more than three days, but now eat from it and keep it as you see fit.) According to another report:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</p><p>(Eat some, keep some and give some in charity.) According to another report:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَأَطْعِمُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</p><p>(Eat some, feed others, and give some in charity.) As for the animal skins, it was recorded in Musnad Ahmad from Qatadah bin An-Nu`man in the Hadith about the sacrifice:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا، وَاسْتَمْتِعُوا بِجُلُودِهَا وَلَا تَبِيعُوهَا»</p><p>(Eat and give in charity, and make use of the skins, but do not sell them.) (Note) It was recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا نَبْدَأُ بِهِ فِي يَوْمِنَا هَذَا أَنْ نُصَلِّيَ، ثُمَّ نَرْجِعَ فَنَنْحَرَ، فَمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ أَصَابَ سُنَّتَنَا، وَمَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ لَحْمٌ قَدَّمَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ لَيْسَ مِنَ النُّسُكِ فِي شَيْء»</p><p>(The first thing that we should do on this day of ours (`Id) is to pray, then we return and offer the sacrifice. Whoever does that will have followed our Sunnah. Whoever slaughters his animal before the prayer, this is just meat which he has brought for his family, it is not a sacrifice at all.) This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And in Sahih Muslim, it is mentioned that one is not to offer the sacrifice until the Imam (leader) has offered his. It is prescribed to offer the sacrifice on the day of Nahr and the following three days of Tashriq, because of the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»</p><p>(The days of Tashriq are all (for) sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Hibban.</p><p>كَذلِكَ سَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</p><p>(Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.) means, for this reason.</p><p>سَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ</p><p>(Thus have We made them subject to you) means, `We have subjugated them to you, i.e., We have made them submissive towards you, so that if you wish you can ride them, or if you wish you can milk them, or if you wish you can slaughter them,' as Allah says:</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعـماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَـلِكُونَ</p><p>(Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners.)36:71 until He said:</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ</p><p>(Will they not then be grateful) 36:73 And Allah says in this Ayah:</p><p>كَذلِكَ سَخَّرْنَـهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</p><p>(Thus have We made them subject to you that you may be grateful.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Goal of the Udhiyyah (Sacrifice) according to Allah is the Sincerity and Taqwa of His Servant</h2><p>Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p><p>لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا</p><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, \"The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"We have more right to do that.\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ</p><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.) That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَلَا إِلَى أَلْوَانِكُمْ، وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُم»</p><p>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.) And in the Hadith; (Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</p><p>كَذَلِكَ سَخَّرَهَا لَكُمْ</p><p>(Thus have We made them subject to you) meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,'</p><p>لِتُكَبِّرُواْ اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ</p><p>(that you may proclaim Allah's greatness for His guidance to you.) means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p><p>وَبَشِّرِ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,' i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p><p>(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ continued to offer sacrifice for ten years.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: \"At the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting by sacrificing more than one and things reached the stage that you see now.\" This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَذْبَحُوا إِلَّا مُسِنَّةً، إِلَّا أَنْ تَعْسُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَذْبَحُوا جَذَعَةً مِنَ الضَّأْن»</p><p>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</p>",
    "<h2>Good News of Allah's Defence for the Believers</h2><p>Here Allah tells us that He defends His servants who put their trust in Him and turn to Him in repentance; He protects them from the the worst of evil people and the plots of the sinners; He protects them, guards them and supports them, as He tells us elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ</div><p>(Is not Allah sufficient for His servant) 39:36</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً</div><p>(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things) 65:3.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ خَوَّانٍ كَفُورٍ</div><p>(Verily, Allah likes not any treacherous ingrate) means, He does not like any of His servants who bear these characteristics, i.e., treachery in covenants and promises whereby a person does not do what he says, and ingratitude is to deny the blessings, whereby one does not acknowledge or appreciate them.</p>",
    "<h2>Permission to fight; this is the first Ayah of Jihad</h2><p>Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions, when they were expelled from Makkah.\" Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others among the Salaf, such as Ibn `Abbas, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayan, Qatadah and others said, \"This is the first Ayah which was revealed about Jihad.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the Prophet was driven out of Makkah, Abu Bakr said, `They have their Prophet. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; surely they are doomed.\"' Ibn `Abbas said, \"Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ</p><p>(Permission (to fight) is given to those (believers) fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.)\" Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Then I knew that there would be fighting.\" Imam Ahmad added: \"Ibn `Abbas said, `This was the first Ayah to be revealed concerning fighting.\"' This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the Book of Tafsir of their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said: \"It is a Hasan Hadith.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ</p><p>(and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.) means, He is able to grant victory to His believing servants without any fighting taking place, but He wants His servants to strive their utmost in obeying Him, as He says:</p><p>فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ حَتَّى إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ الْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ - سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ - وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ</p><p>(So, when you meet those who disbelieve, strike necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly. Thereafter either for generosity, or ransom, until war lays down its burden. Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them. But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them.) 47:4-6</p><p>قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people, and remove the anger of their (believers') hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) 9:14-15</p><p>وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّى نَعْلَمَ الْمُجَـهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَالصَّـبِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَ أَخْبَـرَكُمْ</p><p>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard and the patient, and We shall test your facts.) 47:31. And there are many similar Ayat. Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ</p><p>(and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.) \"And this is what He did.\" Allah prescribed Jihad at an appropriate time, because when they were in Makkah, the idolators outnumbered them by more than ten to one. Were they to engage in fighting at that time, the results would have been disastrous. When the idolators went to extremes to persecute Muslims, to expel the Prophet and resolving to kill him; when they sent his Companions into exile here and there, so that some went to Ethiopia and others went to Al-Madinah; when they settled in Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ joined them there, and they gathered around him and lent him their support, and they had a place where Islam prevailed, and a stronghold to which they could retreat; then Allah prescribed Jihad against the enemy, and this was the first Ayah to be revealed for it. Allah said:</p><p>أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَـتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـرِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ</p><p>(Permission (to fight) is given to those fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said; \"They were driven out of Makkah to Al-Madinah unjustly, i.e., Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions.\"</p><p>إِلاَّ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ</p><p>(only because they said: \"Our Lord is Allah.\") means, they had not done anything to their people or committed any wrongs against them, apart from the fact that they believed in the Oneness of Allah and they worshipped Him Alone, with no partner or associate. But for the idolators, this was the worst of sins, as Allah says:</p><p>يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ أَن تُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) 60:1. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ</p><p>(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another,) meaning, were it not for the fact that He repels one people by means of another, and restrains the evil of people towards others by means of whatever circumstances He creates and decrees, the earth would have been corrupted and the strong would have destroyed the weak.</p><p>لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَمِعُ</p><p>(Sawami` surely have been pulled down) means the small temples used by monks. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Qatadah said, \"This refers to the places of worship of the Sabians;\" according to another report, he said, \"The Sawami` of the Zoroastrians.\" Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"These are houses along the roads.\"</p><p>وَبِيَعٌ</p><p>(Biya`.) These are larger than the Sawami` and accommodate more worshippers; the Christians also have these. This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Sakhr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Khusayf and others. Ibn Jubayr reported from Mujahid and others that this referred to the synagogues of the Jews which are known to them as Salut.

Abu Al-`Aliyah and others said, \"Salawat refers to the places of worship of the Sabians.\" Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"Salawat refers to places of worship of the People of the Book and of the people of Islam along the roads.\" Masjids belong to the Muslims.</p><p>يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً</p><p>(wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much,) It was said that the pronoun refers to Masjids, because this is the closest of the words mentioned. Ad-Dahhak said, \"In all of them the Name of Allah is often mentioned.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"The correct view is that the monasteries of the monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and the Masjids of the Muslims, in which the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would have been destroyed -- because this is the usual usage in Arabic.\" Some of the scholars said, \"This is a sequence listing the smallest to the greatest, because the Masjids are more frequented by more worshippers who have the correct intention and way.\"</p><p>وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause).) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ - وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.) 47:7-8</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ</p><p>(Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) Allah describes Himself as being All-Strong and All-Mighty. By His strength He created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements; by His might nothing can overpower Him or overwhelm Him, rather everything is humbled before Him and is in need of Him. Whoever is supported by the All-Strong, the All-Mighty, is indeed supported and helped, and his enemy will be overpowered. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ</p><p>(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our soldiers!

Ad-Dahhak said, \"In all of them the Name of Allah is often mentioned.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"The correct view is that the monasteries of the monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and the Masjids of the Muslims, in which the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would have been destroyed -- because this is the usual usage in Arabic.\" Some of the scholars said, \"This is a sequence listing the smallest to the greatest, because the Masjids are more frequented by more worshippers who have the correct intention and way.\"</p><p>وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause).) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ - وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَـلَهُمْ</p><p>(O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.) 47:7-8</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ</p><p>(Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) Allah describes Himself as being All-Strong and All-Mighty. By His strength He created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements; by His might nothing can overpower Him or overwhelm Him, rather everything is humbled before Him and is in need of Him. Whoever is supported by the All-Strong, the All-Mighty, is indeed supported and helped, and his enemy will be overpowered. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا الْمُرْسَلِينَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ الْمَنصُورُونَ - وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ الْغَـلِبُونَ</p><p>(And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily, would be made triumphant, and that Our soldiers! They verily, would be the victors.) 37:171-173</p><p>كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ</p><p>(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) 58:21</p>",
    "<h2>The Duties of the Muslims when They attain Power</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uthman bin `Affan said, \"The Ayah:</p><p>الَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ أَقَامُواْ الصَّلَوةَ وَآتَوُاْ الزَّكَـوةَ وَأَمَرُواْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْاْ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ</p><p>(Those who, if We give them power in the land, (they) establish the Salah, enforce the Zakah, and they enjoin the good and forbid the evil.) was revealed concerning us, for we had been expelled from our homes unjustly only because we said: `Our Lord is Allah.' Then we were given power in the land, so we established regular prayer, paid the Zakah, enjoined what is good and forbade what is evil, and with Allah rests the end of (all) matters. This is about my companions and I.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"They were the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ.\" As-Sabah bin Suwadah Al-Kindi said, \"I heard `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz give a speech and say:</p><p>الَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّـهُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(Those who, if We give them power in the land....) Then he said, \"This is not obligatory only for those who are in authority, it also applies to those who are governed by them. Shall I not tell you what you can expect from your governor, and what duties those who are ruled owe to him Your rights over your governor are that he should check on you with regard to your duties towards Allah and restore the rights that you have over one another, and that he should guide you to the straight path as much as possible. Your duties towards him are that you should obey him without cheating and without resentment, and you should obey him both in secret and openly.\" `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said, \"This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ</p><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land) 24:55.</p><p>وَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ</p><p>(And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa) 28:83. Zayd bin Aslam said:</p><p>وَلِلَّهِ عَـقِبَةُ الاٍّمُورِ</p><p>(And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters.) \"And with Allah will be the reward for what they did.\"</p>",

He hears what His servants say, and He sees them, nothing about them or their movement is hidden from Him whatsoever. When Allah tells us that He is controlling the affairs of all that exists, and that He judges, and there is none to reverse His judgement, He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ</div><p>(That is because Allah -- He is the Truth,) meaning, the true God, besides Whom no one deserves worship. He is the Possessor of the greatest sovereignty; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. Everything is in need of Him and submits to Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَـطِلُ</div><p>(and what they invoke besides Him, it is false.) meaning, the idols and false gods. Everything that is worshipped instead of Him -- may He be exalted -- is false, because it can neither bring benefit nor cause harm.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْكَبِيرُ</div><p>(And verily, Allah -- He is the Most High, the Most Great.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْعَظِيمُ</div><p>(and He is the Most High, the Most Great) 42:4</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ</div><p>(the Most Great, the Most High) 13:9. Everything is subject to His might and power; there is no God except Him and no Lord besides Him, because He is the Almighty and there is none mightier than He, the Most High and there is none higher than He, the Most Great and there is none greater than He. Exalted, sanctified, and glorified be He far above all that the evildoers say.</p>",

    "<h2>Signs of the Power of Allah</h2><p>This is a further sign of His might and power; that he sends the winds to drive the clouds which deliver rain to the barren land where nothing grows, land which is dry, dusty and desiccated.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَآءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ</div><p>(but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells) 22:5.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتُصْبِحُ الاٌّرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً</div><p>(and then the earth becomes green) This indicates the sequence of events and how everything follows on according to its nature.

Allah's saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتُصْبِحُ الاٌّرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً</div><p>(and then the earth becomes green) means, it becomes green after being dry and lifeless.

And Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ</div><p>(Verily, Allah is the Most Kind and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things.) He knows what seeds are in the various regions of the earth, no matter how small they are. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.

If He willed, He could give the sky permission to fall on the earth, and whoever is in it would be killed, but by His kindness, mercy and power, He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth, except by His leave. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, Allah is for mankind, full of kindness, Most Merciful.) meaning, even though they do wrong.

    "<h2>The Idolators' worship of others besides Allah and Their vehement rejection of the Ayat of Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us that the idolators, in their ignorance and disbelief, worship besides Allah others which He has sent down no authority for, i.e., no proof or evidence for such behavior. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And whoever calls upon, besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful.) 23:117 So Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَمَا لَيْسَ لَهُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ</div><p>(for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge;) meaning, they have no knowledge in the subject that they fabricate lies about; it is only something which was handed down to them from their fathers and ancestors, with no evidence or proof, and its origins lie in that which the Shaytan beautified for them and made attractive to them. Allah warned them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا لِلظَّـلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ</div><p>(and for the wrongdoers there is no helper.) meaning, no one to help them against Allah when He sends His punishment and torment upon them.

    "<h2>The Command to worship Allah and engage in Jihad</h2><p>It was reported from `Uqbah bin `Amir that the Prophet said:</p><p>«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ بِسَجْدَتَيْنِ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْجُدْهُمَا فَلَا يَقْرَأْهُمَا»</p><p>(Surat Al-Hajj has been blessed with two Sajdahs, so whoever does not prostrate them should not read them.)</p><p>وَجَـهِدُوا فِى اللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَـدِهِ</p><p>(And strive hard in Allah's cause as you ought to strive.) means, with your wealth and your tongues and your bodies. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah as is His due.) 3:102</p><p>هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ</p><p>(He has chosen you,) means, `O Ummah of Islam, Allah has selected you and chosen you over all other nations, and has favored you and blessed you and honored you with the noblest of Messengers and the noblest of Laws.'</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) He has not given you more than you can bear and He has not obliged you to do anything that will cause you difficulty except that He has created for you a way out. So the Salah, which is the most important pillar of Islam after the two testimonies of faith, is obligatory, four Rak`ahs when one is settled, which are shortened to two Rak`ah when one is traveling. According to some Imams, only one Rak`ahs is obligatory at times of fear, as was recorded in the Hadith. A person may pray while walking or riding, facing the Qiblah or otherwise. When praying optional prayers while traveling, one may face the Qiblah or not. A person is not obliged to stand during the prayer if he is sick; the sick person may pray sitting down, and if he is not able to do that then he may pray lying on his side. And there are other exemptions and dispensations which may apply to the obligatory prayers and other duties. So the Prophet said:</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»</p><p>(I have been sent with the easy Hanifi way.) And he said to Mu`adh and Abu Musa, when he sent them as governors to Yemen:</p><p>«بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرا وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا»</p><p>(Give good news and do not repel them. Make things easy for the people and do not make the things difficult for them.) And there are many similar Hadiths. Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship), \"This means difficulty.\"</p><p>مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ</p><p>(It is the religion of your father Ibrahim. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This refers back to the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) meaning, any difficulty.\" On the contrary, He has made it easy for you, like the religion of your father Ibrahim. He said, \"It may be that it means: adhere to the religion of your father Ibrahim.\" I say: This interpretation of the Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</p><p>(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif) 6:161</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an),) Imam `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj, from `Ata', from Ibn `Abbas: concerning Allah's saying,</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(He has named you Muslims before) \"This refers to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Qatadah. Mujahid said, \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous Books and in Adh-Dhikr,</p><p>وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(and in this) means, the Qur'an.\" This was also the view of others, because Allah says:</p><p>هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) Then He urged them to follow the Message which His Messenger brought, by reminding them that this was the religion of their father Ibrahim. Then He mentioned His blessings to this Ummah, whereby He mentioned them and praised them long ago in the Books of the Prophets which were recited to the rabbis and monks. Allah says:</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(He has named you Muslims both before) meaning, before the Qur'an,</p><p>وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(and in this.) Under the explanation of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded from Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ جِثِيِّ جَهَنَّم»</p><p>(Whoever adopts the call of Jahiliyyah, will be one of those who will crawl on their knees in Hell.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, even if he fasts and performs Salah\" He said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى ، فَادْعُوا بِدَعْوَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي سَمَّاكُمْ بِهَا الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»</p><p>(Yes, even if he fasts and performs Salah. So adopt the call of Allah whereby He called you Muslims and believers and servants of Allah.)</p><p>لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p>(that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) means, `thus We have made you a just and fair nation, the best of nations, and all other nations will testify to your justice. On the Day of Resurrection you will be,</p><p>شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p>(witnesses over mankind),' because on that Day all the nations will acknowledge its leadership and its precedence over all others. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection the testimony of the members of this community will be accepted as proof that the Messengers ﷺ conveyed the Message of their Lord to them, and the Messenger will testify that he conveyed the Message to them.</p><p>فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ</p><p>(So perform the Salah, give Zakah) means, respond to this great blessing with gratitude by fulfilling your duties towards Allah, doing that which He has enjoined upon you and avoiding that which He had forbidden. Among the most important duties are establishing regular prayer and giving Zakah. Zakah is a form of beneficence towards Allah's creatures, whereby He has enjoined upon the rich to give a little of their wealth to the poor each year, to help the weak and needy. We have already mentioned its explanation in the Ayah of Zakah in Surat At-Tawbah (9:5).</p><p>وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِاللَّهِ</p><p>(and hold fast to Allah.) means, seek the help and support of Allah and put your trust in Him, and get strength from Him.</p><p>هُوَ مَوْلَـكُمْ</p><p>(He is your Mawla,) meaning, He is your Protector and your Helper, He is the One Who will cause you to prevail against your enemies.</p><p>فَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ</p><p>(what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper!) He is the best Mawla and the best Helper against your enemies. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hajj. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family and Companions, and grant them peace; may Allah honor and be pleased with the Companions and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Resurrection.</p>",
    "<h2>The Command to worship Allah and engage in Jihad</h2><p>It was reported from `Uqbah bin `Amir that the Prophet said:</p><p>«فُضِّلَتْ سُورَةُ الْحَجِّ بِسَجْدَتَيْنِ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْجُدْهُمَا فَلَا يَقْرَأْهُمَا»</p><p>(Surat Al-Hajj has been blessed with two Sajdahs, so whoever does not prostrate them should not read them.)</p><p>وَجَـهِدُوا فِى اللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَـدِهِ</p><p>(And strive hard in Allah's cause as you ought to strive.) means, with your wealth and your tongues and your bodies. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ</p><p>(Have Taqwa of Allah as is His due.) 3:102</p><p>هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ</p><p>(He has chosen you,) means, `O Ummah of Islam, Allah has selected you and chosen you over all other nations, and has favored you and blessed you and honored you with the noblest of Messengers and the noblest of Laws.'</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) He has not given you more than you can bear and He has not obliged you to do anything that will cause you difficulty except that He has created for you a way out. So the Salah, which is the most important pillar of Islam after the two testimonies of faith, is obligatory, four Rak`ahs when one is settled, which are shortened to two Rak`ah when one is traveling. According to some Imams, only one Rak`ahs is obligatory at times of fear, as was recorded in the Hadith. A person may pray while walking or riding, facing the Qiblah or otherwise. When praying optional prayers while traveling, one may face the Qiblah or not. A person is not obliged to stand during the prayer if he is sick; the sick person may pray sitting down, and if he is not able to do that then he may pray lying on his side. And there are other exemptions and dispensations which may apply to the obligatory prayers and other duties. So the Prophet said:</p><p>«بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَة»</p><p>(I have been sent with the easy Hanifi way.) And he said to Mu`adh and Abu Musa, when he sent them as governors to Yemen:</p><p>«بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرا وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا»</p><p>(Give good news and do not repel them. Make things easy for the people and do not make the things difficult for them.) And there are many similar Hadiths. Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship), \"This means difficulty.\"</p><p>مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ</p><p>(It is the religion of your father Ibrahim. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This refers back to the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) meaning, any difficulty.\" On the contrary, He has made it easy for you, like the religion of your father Ibrahim. He said, \"It may be that it means: adhere to the religion of your father Ibrahim.\" I say: This interpretation of the Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</p><p>(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif) 6:161</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an),) Imam `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj, from `Ata', from Ibn `Abbas: concerning Allah's saying,</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(He has named you Muslims before) \"This refers to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Qatadah. Mujahid said, \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous Books and in Adh-Dhikr,</p><p>وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(and in this) means, the Qur'an.\" This was also the view of others, because Allah says:</p><p>هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) Then He urged them to follow the Message which His Messenger brought, by reminding them that this was the religion of their father Ibrahim. Then He mentioned His blessings to this Ummah, whereby He mentioned them and praised them long ago in the Books of the Prophets which were recited to the rabbis and monks. Allah says:</p><p>هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(He has named you Muslims both before) meaning, before the Qur'an,</p><p>وَفِى هَـذَا</p><p>(and in this.) Under the explanation of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded from Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ جِثِيِّ جَهَنَّم»</p><p>(Whoever adopts the call of Jahiliyyah, will be one of those who will crawl on their knees in Hell.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, even if he fasts and performs Salah\" He said,</p><p>«نَعَمْ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى ، فَادْعُوا بِدَعْوَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي سَمَّاكُمْ بِهَا الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»</p><p>(Yes, even if he fasts and performs Salah. So adopt the call of Allah whereby He called you Muslims and believers and servants of Allah.)</p><p>لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p>(that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) means, `thus We have made you a just and fair nation, the best of nations, and all other nations will testify to your justice. On the Day of Resurrection you will be,</p><p>شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p>(witnesses over mankind),' because on that Day all the nations will acknowledge its leadership and its precedence over all others. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection the testimony of the members of this community will be accepted as proof that the Messengers ﷺ conveyed the Message of their Lord to them, and the Messenger will testify that he conveyed the Message to them.</p><p>فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ</p><p>(So perform the Salah, give Zakah) means, respond to this great blessing with gratitude by fulfilling your duties towards Allah, doing that which He has enjoined upon you and avoiding that which He had forbidden. Among the most important duties are establishing regular prayer and giving Zakah. Zakah is a form of beneficence towards Allah's creatures, whereby He has enjoined upon the rich to give a little of their wealth to the poor each year, to help the weak and needy. We have already mentioned its explanation in the Ayah of Zakah in Surat At-Tawbah (9:5).</p><p>وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِاللَّهِ</p><p>(and hold fast to Allah.) means, seek the help and support of Allah and put your trust in Him, and get strength from Him.</p><p>هُوَ مَوْلَـكُمْ</p><p>(He is your Mawla,) meaning, He is your Protector and your Helper, He is the One Who will cause you to prevail against your enemies.</p><p>فَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ</p><p>(what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper!) He is the best Mawla and the best Helper against your enemies. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hajj. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family and Companions, and grant them peace; may Allah honor and be pleased with the Companions and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Resurrection.</p>"
