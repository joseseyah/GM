    "<h2>The Story of killing the Boy</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانطَلَقَا</div><p>(Then they both proceeded,) means, after the first incident,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلاَمًا فَقَتَلَهُ</div><p>(till they met a boy, and he (Khidr) killed him.) It has been stated previously that this boy was playing with other boys in one of the towns, and that Al-Khidr deliberately singled him out. He was the finest and most handsome of them all, and Al-Khidr killed him.

    "<h2>Interpretations of why the Ship was damaged</h2><p>This is an explanation of what Musa found so hard to understand, and the appearence of which he condemed. Allah showed Al-Khidr the hidden reasons, so he said, \"I damaged the ship to make it faulty, because they used to pass by a king who was one of the oppressors, who</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَأْخُذُ كُلَّ سَفِينَةٍ</div><p>(seized every boat), i.e., every good, sound boat</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">غَصْباً</div><p>(by force.) `So I wanted to prevent him from taking this boat by making it appear faulty, so that its poor owners who had nothing else could benefit from it.' It was also said that they were orphans.</p>",
    "<h2>Interpretation of why the Boy was killed</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas narrated from Ubayy bin Ka`b that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْغُلَامُ الَّذِي قَتَلَهُ الْخَضِرُ طُبِعَ يَوْمَ طُبِعَ كَافِرًا»</div><p>(The boy Al-Khidr killed was destined to be a disbeliever from the day he was created.) It was recorded by Ibn Jarir from Ibn `Abbas. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَآ أَن يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَـناً وَكُفْراً</div><p>(his parents were believers, and we feared he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief) Their love for him might make them follow him in disbelief. Qatadah said, \"His parents rejoiced when he was born and grieved for him when he was killed. If he had stayed alive, he would have been the cause of their doom. So let a man be content with the decree of Allah, for the decree of Allah for the believer, if he dislikes it, is better for him than if He were to decree something that he likes for him.\" An authentic Hadith says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا يَقْضِي اللهُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ مِنْ قَضَاءٍ إِلَّا كَانَ خَيْرًا لَه»</div><p>(Allah does not decree anything for the believer except it is good for him.) And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ</div><p>(and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you.) 2:216.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرَدْنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْراً مِّنْهُ زَكَـوةً وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْماً </div><p>(So we intended that their Lord should exchange him for them for one better in righteousness and nearer to mercy. ) A child who was better than this one, a child for whom they would feel more compassion.

This was the view of Ibn Jurayj.</p>",
    "<h2>Interpretation of why the Wall was repaired for no Charge</h2><p>In this Ayah there is a proof that the word Qaryah (village) may be used to refer to a city (Madinah), because Allah first says,</p><p>حَتَّى إِذَآ أَتَيَآ أَهْلَ قَرْيَةٍ</p><p>(till when they came to the people of a town (Qaryah)) 18:77, but here He says:</p><p>فَكَانَ لِغُلَـمَيْنِ يَتِيمَيْنِ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ</p><p>(it belonged to two orphan boys in the town (Al-Madinah);) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِىَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَتْكَ</p><p>(And many a town (Qaryah), stronger than your town which has driven you out We have destroyed) 47:13 and;</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And they say: \"Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns (Al-Qaryatayn)\")43:31 meaning Makkah and At-Ta'if. The meaning of the Ayah 18:82 is: \"I repaired this wall because it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and underneath it was some treasure belonging to them.\" `Ikrimah, Qatadah and others said, \"Underneath it there was some wealth that was buried for them.\" This meaning is apparent from the context of the Ayah, and is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him).</p><p>وَكَانَ أَبُوهُمَا صَـلِحاً</p><p>(their father was a righteous man,) indicates that a righteous person's offspring will be taken care of, and that the blessing of his worship will extend to them in this world and in the Hereafter. This will occur through his intercession for them, as well as their status being raised to the highest levels of Paradise, so that he may find joy in them. This was stated in the Qur'an and reported in the Sunnah. Sa`id bin Jubayr narrated from Ibn `Abbas: \"They were taken care of because their father was a righteous man, although it is not stated that they themselves were righteous.\"</p><p>فَأَرَادَ رَبُّكَ أَن يَبْلُغَآ أَشُدَّهُمَا وَيَسْتَخْرِجَا كَنزَهُمَا</p><p>(your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure) Here will is attributed to Allah, the Exalted, because no one else is able to bring them to the age of full strength and puberty except Allah. In contrast, He said about the boy:</p><p>فَأَرَدْنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْراً مِّنْهُ زَكَـوةً</p><p>(So we intended that their Lord should exchange him for them for one better in righteousness) and concerning the ship:</p><p>فَأَرَدتُّ أَنْ أَعِيبَهَا</p><p>(So I wished to make a defective damage in it,) And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Was Al-Khidr a Prophet</h2><p>رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ أَمْرِى</p><p>(as a mercy from your Lord. And I did them not of my own accord.) Meaning, `These three things that I did, come from the mercy of Allah for those we have mentioned, the crew of the ship, the parents of the boy and the two sons of the righteous man; I was only commanded to do these things that were enjoined upon me.' This is proof and evidence in support of those who say that Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, was a Prophet, along with the Ayah which we have already quoted:</p><p>فَوَجَدَا عَبْدًا مِّنْ عِبَادِنَآ ءَاتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّا عِلْمًا</p><p>(Then they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us.) 18:65</p><h2>Why he was called Al-Khidr</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said concerning Al-Khidr؛</p><p>«إِنَّمَا سُمِّيَ خَضِرًا لِأَنَّهُ جَلَسَ عَلَى فَرْوَةٍ بَيْضَاءَ، فَإِذَا هِيَ تَهْتَزُّ مِنْ تَحْتِهِ خَضْرَاء»</p><p>(He was called Al-Khidr because he sat on a barren Farwah that turned white, then it turned green (Khadra') beneath him.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this from `Abdur-Razzaq. It was also recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Hammam from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّمَا سُمِّي الْخَضِرَ لِأَنَّهُ جَلَسَ عَلَى فَرْوَةٍ، فَإِذَا هِيَ تَهْتَزُّ مِنْ تَحْتِهِ خَضْرَاء»</p><p>(He was called Al-Khidr because he sat on a barren Farwah and it turned green (Khadra') beneath him.) The meaning of Farwah here is a patch of withered vegetation. This was the view of `Abdur-Razzaq. It was also said that it means the face of the earth.</p><p>ذَلِكَ تَأْوِيلُ مَا لَمْ تَسْطِـع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً</p><p>(That is the interpretation of those (things) over which you could not be patient.) meaning, `this is the explanation of the things which you could not put up with or be patient with until I took the initiative of explaining them to you.' When he explained them and made them clear and solved the confusion, he used a milder form of the verb,</p><p>تَسْطِـع</p><p>(you could) When the matter was still confusing and very difficult, a more intensive form was used,</p><p>سَأُنَبِّئُكَ بِتَأْوِيلِ مَا لَمْ تَسْتَطِع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً</p><p>(I will tell you the interpretation of (those) things over which you were unable to be patient with) 18:78. The intensity of the verbal form used reflects the intensity of the confusion felt. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَمَا اسْطَـعُواْ أَن يَظْهَرُوهُ</p><p>(So they (Ya`juj and Ma`juj) were not able to scale it) 18:97 which means ascending to its highest point,</p><p>وَمَا اسْتَطَـعُواْ لَهُ نَقْبًا</p><p>(nor are they able to dig through it) 18:97 which is more difficult than the former. The intensity of the verbal form used reflects the difficulty of the action, which has to do with the subtleties of meaning. And Allah knows best. If one were to ask, what happened to the boy-servant of Musa who appears at the beginning of the story but then is not mentioned The answer is that the objective of the story is what happened between Musa and Al-Khidr. Musa's boy-servant was with him, following him. It is clearly mentioned in the Sahih Hadiths referred to above that he was Yusha` bin Nun, who was the one who became the leader of the Children of Israel after Musa, peace be upon him.</p>",

    "<h2>The Greatest Losers in respect of (Their) Deeds</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded from `Amr that Mus`ab who said: \"I asked my father -- meaning Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas -- about Allah's saying,</p><p>قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِالاٌّخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَـلاً</p><p>(Say: \"Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds\") `Are they the Haruriyyah' He said, `No, they are the Jews and Christians. As for the Jews, they disbelieved in Muhammad ﷺ, and as for the Christians, they disbelieved in Paradise and said that there is no food or drink there, and the Haruriyyah are those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it.' Sa`d used to call them Al-Fasiqin (the corrupt). `Ali bin Abi Talib, Ad-Dahhak and others said: \"They are the Haruriyyah,\" so this means, that according to `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, this Ayah includes the Haruriyyah just as it includes the Jews, the Christians and others. This does not mean that the Ayah was revealed concerning any of these groups in particular; it is more general than that, because the Ayah was revealed in Makkah, before the Qur'an addressed the Jews and Christians, and before the Khawarij existed at all. So the Ayah is general and refers to everyone who worships Allah in a way that is not acceptable, thinking that he is right in doing that and that his deeds will be accepted, but he is mistaken and his deeds will be rejected, as Allah says:</p><p>وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ - عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً</p><p>(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) 88:2-4</p><p>وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَى مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً</p><p>(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) 25:23</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً</p><p>(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) 24:39 And in this Ayah Allah says:</p><p>قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم</p><p>(Say: \"Shall We tell you...\") meaning, `Shall We inform you;'</p><p>بِالاٌّخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَـلاً</p><p>(the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds) Then Allah explains who they are, and says:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life) meaning, they did deeds that do not count, deeds that are not in accordance with the prescribed way that is acceptable to Allah.</p><p>وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا</p><p>(while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds.) means, they thought that there was some basis for their deeds and that they were accepted and loved.</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ</p><p>(They are those who deny the Ayat of their Lord and the meeting with Him.) they denied the signs of Allah in this world, the proofs that He has established of His Oneness and of the truth of His Messengers, and they denied the Hereafter.</p><p>فَلاَ نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَزْناً</p><p>(and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them.) means, `We will not make their Balance heavy because it is empty of any goodness.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّهُ لَيَأْتِي الرَّجُلُ الْعَظِيمُ السَّمِينُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ وَقَالَ: اقْرَءُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p>فَلاَ نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَزْناً</p><p>(A huge fat man will come forward on the Day of Resurrection and he will weigh no more than the wing of a gnat to Allah. Recite, if you wish:) (and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them) It was also recorded by Muslim.</p><p>ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ بِمَا كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(That shall be their recompense, Hell; because they disbelieved) means, `We will punish them with that because of their disbelief and because they took the signs and Messengers of Allah ﷺ as a joke, mocking them and disbelieving them in the worst way.'</p>",

    "<h2>Muhammad ﷺ is a Human Being and a Messenger, and the God is One</h2><p>Allah says to His Messenger Muhammad ,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) to these idolators who reject your message to them,</p><p>إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ</p><p>(`I am only a man like you.) Whoever claims that I am lying, let him bring something like this that I have brought. For I did not know the Unseen, the matters of the past which you asked me about and I told you about, the story of the people of the Cave and of Dhul-Qarnayn, stories which are true -- I did not know any of this except for what Allah made known to me. And I tell you,</p><p>إِنَّمَآ إِلَـهُكُمُ</p><p>(that your God), Who calls you to worship Him,</p><p>إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ</p><p>(is One God), with no partner or associate.'</p><p>فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِ</p><p>(So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord,) i.e., hopes for a good reward and recompense,</p><p>فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلاً صَـلِحاً</p><p>(let him work righteousness) meaning, in accordance with the prescribed laws of Allah,</p><p>وَلاَ يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدَا</p><p>(and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.) This is what is meant by seeking the pleasure of Allah alone with no associate or partner. These are the two basic features of acceptable deeds: their intent is for the sake of Allah alone, and are done in accordance with the way of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Imam Ahmad recorded that Mahmud bin Labid said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافَ عَلَيْكُمُ الشِّرْكُ الْأَصْغَر»</p><p>(What I fear the most for you is the small Shirk.) \"They said: What is the small Shirk, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><p>«الرِّيَاءُ، يَقُولُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِذَا جَزَىَ النَّاسَ بِأَعْمَالِهِمْ: اذْهَبُوا إِلَى الَّذِينَ كُنْتُمْ تُرَاءُونَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَانْظُرُوا هَلْ تَجِدُونَ عِنْدَهُمْ جَزَاءً؟»</p><p>(Showing off (Ar-Riya'). Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection, when the people are rewarded or punished for their deeds, \"Go to the one for whom you were showing off in the world and see if you will find any reward with him.\") Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id bin Abi Fadalah Al-Ansari, who was one of the Companions, said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِذَا جَمَعَ اللهُ الْأَوَّلِينَ وَالْآخِرِينَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ لِيَوْمٍ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ نَادَى مُنَادٍ: مَنْ كَانَ أَشْرَكَ فِي عَمَلٍ عَمِلَهُ للهِ أَحَدًا فَلْيَطْلُبْ ثَوَابَهُ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيْرِ اللهِ،فَإِنَّ اللهَ أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنِ الشِّرْك»</p><p>(Allah will gather the first and the last on the Day of Resurrection, the Day concerning which there is no doubt. A voice will call out, \"Whoever used to associate anyone with Allah in the deeds which he did, let him seek his reward from someone other than Allah, for Allah is the least in need of any partner or associate.) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Kahf. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.</p>",
    "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded a Hadith of Umm Salamah in his Sirah, and Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from Ibn Mas`ud, the story of the Hijrah (migration) to Ethiopia from Makkah. The narration mentions that Ja`far bin Abi Talib recited the first part of this Surah to An-Najashi and his companions.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Story of Zakariyya and His Supplication for a Son The discussion about the separate letters has already preceded at the beginning ofSurat Al-Baqarah.</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(A reminder of the mercy of your Lord) This means that this is a reminder of Allah's mercy upon His servant Zakariyya. Yahya bin Ya`mar recited it, (ذَكَّرَ رَحْمَةَ رَبكَ عبدَه زكريا) \"He has reminded of your Lord's mercy to His servant Zakariyya.\" The word Zakariyya in the Ayah has been recited with elongation and also shortened. Both recitations are well-known. He was a great Prophet from the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded that the Prophet said about Zakariyya that He was a carpenter who used to eat from what he earned with his own hand through carpentry. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called his Lord with a call in secret.) He only made his supplication secretly because it is more beloved to Allah. This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called out his Lord with a call in secret. ) \"Verily, Allah knows the pious heart and he hears the hidden voice.\"</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّى</p><p>(He said: \"My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble...\") meaning, \"I have become weak and feeble in strength.\"</p><p>وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْباً</p><p>(and gray hair has Ashta`al on my head,) means the gray hair has burned into the black hair. The intent is to inform of weakness and old age, and its external and internal traces. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً</p><p>(and I have never been unblessed in my invocation to You, O my Lord!) This means, \"I have not experienced from You except that You would respond to my supplication and that You would never refuse me in whatever I ask of You.\" Concerning His statement,</p><p>وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِىَ مِن وَرَآئِى</p><p>(And verily, I fear Mawali after me,) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, \"In saying the word Mawali, he (Zakariyya) meant his succeeding relatives.\" The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his prophethood and that which was revealed to him. In response to this I would like to point out that he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two Sahihs, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) In a narration recorded by At-Tirmidhi with an authentic chain of narrations, he said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَث»</p><p>(We, Prophets do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth).) Therefore, the meaning in these Hadiths restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement,</p><p>فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاًيَرِثُنِى</p><p>(So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me,) inheritance of prophethood. For this reason Allah said,</p><p>وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</p><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.)27:16 This means that he inherited prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth. It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father. Therefore, if this was not referring to a specific type of inheritance, then Allah would not have mentioned it. All of this is supported and affirmed by what is in the authentic Hadith:</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We Prophets do not leave behind any inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) Mujahid said concerning his statement,</p><p>يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya'qub.) 19:6 \"His inheritance was knowledge, and Zakariyya was one of the descendants of Ya`qub.\" Hushaym said, \"Isma'il bin Abi Khalid informed us that Abu Salih commented about the Ayah:</p><p>يَرِثُنِى وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) \"He would be a Prophet like his forefathers were Prophets.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّاً</p><p>(and make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased!) means \"Make him pleasing to You (Allah) and your creation.

Therefore, the meaning in these Hadiths restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement,</p><p>فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاًيَرِثُنِى</p><p>(So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me,) inheritance of prophethood. For this reason Allah said,</p><p>وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</p><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.)27:16 This means that he inherited prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth. It is already well-known and established in all of the previous laws and divinely revealed creeds, that the son inherits the wealth of his father. Therefore, if this was not referring to a specific type of inheritance, then Allah would not have mentioned it. All of this is supported and affirmed by what is in the authentic Hadith:</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We Prophets do not leave behind any inheritance (of wealth).

    "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded a Hadith of Umm Salamah in his Sirah, and Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from Ibn Mas`ud, the story of the Hijrah (migration) to Ethiopia from Makkah. The narration mentions that Ja`far bin Abi Talib recited the first part of this Surah to An-Najashi and his companions.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Story of Zakariyya and His Supplication for a Son The discussion about the separate letters has already preceded at the beginning ofSurat Al-Baqarah.</h2><p>Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(A reminder of the mercy of your Lord) This means that this is a reminder of Allah's mercy upon His servant Zakariyya. Yahya bin Ya`mar recited it, (ذَكَّرَ رَحْمَةَ رَبكَ عبدَه زكريا) \"He has reminded of your Lord's mercy to His servant Zakariyya.\" The word Zakariyya in the Ayah has been recited with elongation and also shortened. Both recitations are well-known. He was a great Prophet from the Prophets of the Children of Israel. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded that the Prophet said about Zakariyya that He was a carpenter who used to eat from what he earned with his own hand through carpentry. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called his Lord with a call in secret.) He only made his supplication secretly because it is more beloved to Allah. This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً</p><p>(When he called out his Lord with a call in secret. ) \"Verily, Allah knows the pious heart and he hears the hidden voice.\"</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّى</p><p>(He said: \"My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble...\") meaning, \"I have become weak and feeble in strength.\"</p><p>وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْباً</p><p>(and gray hair has Ashta`al on my head,) means the gray hair has burned into the black hair. The intent is to inform of weakness and old age, and its external and internal traces. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً</p><p>(and I have never been unblessed in my invocation to You, O my Lord!) This means, \"I have not experienced from You except that You would respond to my supplication and that You would never refuse me in whatever I ask of You.\" Concerning His statement,</p><p>وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ الْمَوَالِىَ مِن وَرَآئِى</p><p>(And verily, I fear Mawali after me,) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said, \"In saying the word Mawali, he (Zakariyya) meant his succeeding relatives.\" The reason for his fear was that he was afraid that the generation that would succeed him would be a wicked generation. Thus, he asked Allah for a son who would be a Prophet after him, who would guide them with his prophethood and that which was revealed to him. In response to this I would like to point out that he was not afraid of them inheriting his wealth. For a Prophet is too great in status, and too lofty in esteem to become remorseful over his wealth in this fashion. A Prophet would not disdain to leave his wealth to his successive relatives, and thus ask to have a son who would receive his inheritance instead of them. This is one angle of argument. The second argument is that Allah did not mention that he (Zakariyya) was wealthy. On the contrary, he was a carpenter who ate from the earnings of his own hand. This type of person usually does not have a mass of wealth. Amassing wealth is not something normal for Prophets, for verily, they are the most abstentious in matters of this worldly life. The third argument is that it is confirmed in the Two Sahihs, in more than one narration, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا نُورَثُ، مَا تَرَكْنَا فَهُوَ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(We (the Prophets) do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth). Whatever we leave behind, then it is charity.) In a narration recorded by At-Tirmidhi with an authentic chain of narrations, he said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ لَا نُورَث»</p><p>(We, Prophets do not leave behind inheritance (of wealth).) Therefore, the meaning in these Hadiths restricts the meaning of Zakariyya's statement,</p><p>فَهَبْ لِى مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاًيَرِثُنِى</p><p>(So give me from yourself an heir. Who shall inherit me,) inheritance of prophethood. For this reason Allah said,</p><p>وَيَرِثُ مِنْ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p>(and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub.) This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَـنُ دَاوُودَ</p><p>(And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.)27:16 This means that he inherited prophethood from him. If this had meant wealth, he would not have been singled with it among his other brothers. There also would have been no important benefit in mentioning it if it was referring to wealth.

    "<h2>The acceptance of His Supplication</h2><p>This statement implies what is not mentioned, that his supplication was answered. It was said to him,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يزَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلَـمٍ اسْمُهُ يَحْيَى</div><p>((Allah said:) \"O Zakariyya!

Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.\" Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in the Mihrab, (saying): \"Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, confirming (believing in) the word from Allah, noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous.\")3:38-39 Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ سَمِيّاً</div><p>(We have given that name to none before (him).) Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said, \"This means that no one had this name before him.\" Ibn Jarir preferred this interpretation, may Allah have mercy upon him.</p>",
    "<h2>His amazement after the acceptance of His Supplication</h2><p>Zakariyya was amazed when his supplication was answered and he was given the good news of a son. He became extremely overjoyed and asked how this child would be born to him, and in what manner he would come. This was particularly amazing because his wife was an old woman who was barren and had not given birth to any children in her entire life. Even Zakariyya himself had become old and advanced in years, his bones had become feeble and thin, and he had no potent semen or vigor for sexual intercourse. The Answer of the Angel</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ</div><p>(He said:) That is, the angel, in his response to Zakariyya and his was amazement.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(\"Thus says your Lord: `It is easy for Me...\"') Meaning the birth of the son will be from you and from this wife of yours and not from any other (woman).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(easy) Meaning, it is simple and easy for Allah to do. Then he (the angel) mentioned to him that which is more amazing than what he was asking about.

    "<h2>The Birth of the Boy and His Characteristics</h2><p>This also implies what is not mentioned, that this promised boy was born and he was Yahya. There is also the implication that Allah taught him the Book, the Tawrah which they used to study among themselves. The Prophets who were sent to the Jews used to rule according to the Tawrah, as did the scholars and rabbis among them. He was still young in age when Allah gave him this knowledge. This is the reason that Allah mentioned it. Because of how Allah favored him and his parents, He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ييَحْيَى خُذِ الْكِتَـبَ بِقُوَّةٍ</div><p>(O Yahya!

After Allah mentioned Yahya's obedience to his Lord and that Allah created him full of mercy, purity and piety, He attached to it his obedience to his parents and his good treatment of them. Allah mentioned that he refrained from disobeying them in speech, actions, commands and prohibitions. Due to this Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَكُن جَبَّاراً عَصِيّاً</div><p>(and he was not arrogant or disobedient.)

The first situation is on the day that he is born, when he sees himself coming out of what he was in. The second situation is on the day that he dies, when he sees people that he will not see anymore. The third situation is on the day when he is resurrected, when he sees himself in the great gathering.

    "<h2>The Story of Maryam and Al-Masih (`Isa)</h2><p>After Allah, the Exalted, mentioned the story of Zakariyya, and that He blessed him with a righteous, purified and blessed child even in his old age while his wife was barren, He then mentions the story of Maryam. Allah informs of His granting her a child named `Isa without a father being involved (in her pregnancy). Between these two stories there is an appropriate and similar relationship. Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And mention in the Book, Maryam,) She was Maryam bint `Imran from the family lineage of Dawud. She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel. Allah mentioned the story of her mother's pregnancy with her in Surah Al `Imran, and that she (Maryam's mother) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah. This meant that she dedicated the child (Maryam) to the service of the Masjid of the Sacred House (in Jerusalem). Thus, they (Zakariyya, Maryam's mother and Maryam) were similar in that aspect.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner.)3:37 Thus, Maryam was raised among the Children of Israel in an honorable way. She was one of the female worshippers, well-known for her remarkable acts of worship, devotion and perseverance. She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time. He was a great man among them, whom they would refer to in their religious matters. Zakariyya saw astonishing miracles occur from her that amazed him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</div><p>(Every time Zakaiyya entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you got this\" She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides to whom He wills, without limit.) 3:37 It has been mentioned that he would find her with winter fruit during the summer and summer fruit during the winter. This has already been explained in Surah Al `Imran. Then, when Allah wanted to grant her His servant and Messenger, `Isa, one of the five Great Messengers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east.) 19:16 This means that she withdrew from them and secluded herself from them. She went to the eastern side of the Sacred Masjid (in Jerusalem). It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah's creation of why the Christians took the east as the direction of devotional worship. They did because of Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(When she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.) Therefore, they took the birthplace of `Isa as their direction of worship.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّخَذَتْ مِن دُونِهِم حِجَاباً</div><p>(She placed a screen before them;) This means that she hid herself from them and concealed herself. Then, Allah sent Jibril to her.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَراً سَوِيّاً</div><p>(and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.) 19:17 This means that he came to her in the form of a perfect and complete man. Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj, Wahb bin Munabbih and As-Suddi all commented on Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهَآ رُوحَنَا</div><p>(then We sent to her Our Ruh,) \"It means Jibril.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً </div><p>(She said: \"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.\") This means that when the angel (Jibril) appeared to her in the form of a man, while she was in a place secluded by herself with a partition between her and her people, she was afraid of him and thought that he wanted to rape her. Therefore, she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.) She meant, \"If you fear Allah,\" as a means of reminding him of Allah. This is what is legislated in defense against (evil), so that it may be repulsed with ease. Therefore, the first thing she did was try to make him fear Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Ibn Jarir reported from `Asim that Abu Wa'il said when mentioning the story of Maryam, \"She knew that the pious person would refrain (from committing evil) when she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاًقَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.\" He said: \"I am only a messenger from your Lord...\") This means that the angel said to her in response, and in order to remove the fear that she felt within herself, \"I am not what you think, but I am the messenger of your Lord.\" By this he meant, \"Allah has sent me to you.\" It is said that when she mentioned the (Name of the) Most Beneficent (Ar-Rahman), Jibril fell apart and returned to his true form (as an angel). He responded, (إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِيَهَب لَكِ غُلَـمًا زَكِيًّا) `I am only a messenger from your Lord, to provide to you the gift of a righteous son.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلَـمٌ</div><p>(She said: \"How can I have a son...\") This means that Maryam was amazed at this. She said, \"How can I have a son\" She said this to mean, \"In what way would a son be born to me when I do not have a husband and I do not commit any wicked acts (i.e. fornication)\" For this reason she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيّاً</div><p>(when no man has touched me, nor am I Baghiyya) The Baghiyy is a female fornicator. For this reason, a Hadith has been reported prohibiting the money earned from Baghiyy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(He said: \"Thus said your Lord: `That is easy for Me (Allah)...\") This means that the angel said to her in response to her question, \"Verily, Allah has said that a boy will be born from you even though you do not have a husband and you have not committed any lewdness. Verily, He is Most Able to do whatever He wills.\" Due to this, he (Jibril) conveyed Allah's Words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</div><p>(And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) This means a proof and a sign for mankind of the power of their Maker and Creator, Who diversified them in their creation. He created their father, Adam, without a male (father) or female (mother). Then, He created Hawwa' (Adam's spouse) from a male (father) without a female (mother). Then, He created the rest of their progeny from male and female, except `Isa. He caused `Isa to be born from a female without a male. Thus, Allah completed the four types of creation (of the human being), which proves the perfection of His power and the magnificence of His authority. There is no god worthy of worship except Him and there is no true Lord other than Him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا</div><p>(and a mercy from Us,) This means, \"We will make this boy a mercy from Allah and a Prophet from among the Prophets. He will call to the worship of Allah and monotheistic belief in Him. This is as Allah, the Exalted, said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ قَالَتِ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ اسْمُهُ الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهًا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - وَيُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِى الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>((Remember) when the angels said: \"O Maryam! Verily, Allah gives you the good news of a Word from Him, his name will be Al-Masih, `Isa, the son of Maryam, held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah. And he will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.) 3:45-46 This means that he will call to the worship of his Lord in his cradle and while and adult. Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) This is the completion of Jibril's dialogue with Maryam. He informed her that this matter was preordained by Allah's power and will. Muhammad bin Ishaq said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) \"This means that Allah determined to do this, so there is no avoiding it.\"</p>",

Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things.

Due to their closeness in meaning, Allah mentioned them here together, as well as in Surahs Al `Imran and Al-Anbiya'. Allah has mentioned these stories to show His servants His ability, the might of His authority and that He has power over all things. Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَـبِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And mention in the Book, Maryam,) She was Maryam bint `Imran from the family lineage of Dawud. She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel. Allah mentioned the story of her mother's pregnancy with her in Surah Al `Imran, and that she (Maryam's mother) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah. This meant that she dedicated the child (Maryam) to the service of the Masjid of the Sacred House (in Jerusalem). Thus, they (Zakariyya, Maryam's mother and Maryam) were similar in that aspect.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner.)3:37 Thus, Maryam was raised among the Children of Israel in an honorable way. She was one of the female worshippers, well-known for her remarkable acts of worship, devotion and perseverance. She lived under the care of her brother-in-law, Zakariyya, who was a Prophet of the Children of Israel at that time. He was a great man among them, whom they would refer to in their religious matters. Zakariyya saw astonishing miracles occur from her that amazed him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</div><p>(Every time Zakaiyya entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you got this\" She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides to whom He wills, without limit.) 3:37 It has been mentioned that he would find her with winter fruit during the summer and summer fruit during the winter. This has already been explained in Surah Al `Imran. Then, when Allah wanted to grant her His servant and Messenger, `Isa, one of the five Great Messengers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east.) 19:16 This means that she withdrew from them and secluded herself from them. She went to the eastern side of the Sacred Masjid (in Jerusalem). It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, I am the most knowledgeable of Allah's creation of why the Christians took the east as the direction of devotional worship. They did because of Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً</div><p>(When she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.) Therefore, they took the birthplace of `Isa as their direction of worship.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّخَذَتْ مِن دُونِهِم حِجَاباً</div><p>(She placed a screen before them;) This means that she hid herself from them and concealed herself. Then, Allah sent Jibril to her.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَراً سَوِيّاً</div><p>(and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.) 19:17 This means that he came to her in the form of a perfect and complete man. Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj, Wahb bin Munabbih and As-Suddi all commented on Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهَآ رُوحَنَا</div><p>(then We sent to her Our Ruh,) \"It means Jibril.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً </div><p>(She said: \"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.\") This means that when the angel (Jibril) appeared to her in the form of a man, while she was in a place secluded by herself with a partition between her and her people, she was afraid of him and thought that he wanted to rape her. Therefore, she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.) She meant, \"If you fear Allah,\" as a means of reminding him of Allah. This is what is legislated in defense against (evil), so that it may be repulsed with ease. Therefore, the first thing she did was try to make him fear Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Ibn Jarir reported from `Asim that Abu Wa'il said when mentioning the story of Maryam, \"She knew that the pious person would refrain (from committing evil) when she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَعُوذُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاًقَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ</div><p>(\"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious from you, if you do fear Allah.\" He said: \"I am only a messenger from your Lord...\") This means that the angel said to her in response, and in order to remove the fear that she felt within herself, \"I am not what you think, but I am the messenger of your Lord.\" By this he meant, \"Allah has sent me to you.\" It is said that when she mentioned the (Name of the) Most Beneficent (Ar-Rahman), Jibril fell apart and returned to his true form (as an angel). He responded, (إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لِيَهَب لَكِ غُلَـمًا زَكِيًّا) `I am only a messenger from your Lord, to provide to you the gift of a righteous son.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لِى غُلَـمٌ</div><p>(She said: \"How can I have a son...\") This means that Maryam was amazed at this. She said, \"How can I have a son\" She said this to mean, \"In what way would a son be born to me when I do not have a husband and I do not commit any wicked acts (i.e. fornication)\" For this reason she said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِى بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيّاً</div><p>(when no man has touched me, nor am I Baghiyya) The Baghiyy is a female fornicator. For this reason, a Hadith has been reported prohibiting the money earned from Baghiyy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَىَّ هَيِّنٌ</div><p>(He said: \"Thus said your Lord: `That is easy for Me (Allah)...\") This means that the angel said to her in response to her question, \"Verily, Allah has said that a boy will be born from you even though you do not have a husband and you have not committed any lewdness. Verily, He is Most Able to do whatever He wills.\" Due to this, he (Jibril) conveyed Allah's Words,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</div><p>(And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind) This means a proof and a sign for mankind of the power of their Maker and Creator, Who diversified them in their creation. He created their father, Adam, without a male (father) or female (mother). Then, He created Hawwa' (Adam's spouse) from a male (father) without a female (mother). Then, He created the rest of their progeny from male and female, except `Isa. He caused `Isa to be born from a female without a male. Thus, Allah completed the four types of creation (of the human being), which proves the perfection of His power and the magnificence of His authority. There is no god worthy of worship except Him and there is no true Lord other than Him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا</div><p>(and a mercy from Us,) This means, \"We will make this boy a mercy from Allah and a Prophet from among the Prophets. He will call to the worship of Allah and monotheistic belief in Him. This is as Allah, the Exalted, said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ قَالَتِ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ يمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ اسْمُهُ الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهًا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - وَيُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِى الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ </div><p>((Remember) when the angels said: \"O Maryam! Verily, Allah gives you the good news of a Word from Him, his name will be Al-Masih, `Isa, the son of Maryam, held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah. And he will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.) 3:45-46 This means that he will call to the worship of his Lord in his cradle and while and adult. Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) This is the completion of Jibril's dialogue with Maryam. He informed her that this matter was preordained by Allah's power and will. Muhammad bin Ishaq said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً</div><p>(and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).) \"This means that Allah determined to do this, so there is no avoiding it.\"</p>",

    "<h2>The Conception and the Birth</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about Maryam that when Jibril had spoken to her about what Allah said, she accepted the decree of Allah.

Then the breath descended until it entered into her vagina and she conceived the child by the leave of Allah. Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"When she conceived him and filled her water jug (at a well), she returned (to her people). After this, her menstrual bleeding ceased and she experienced what the pregnant woman experiences of sickness, hunger, change of color and there was even a change in the manner of her speech. After this, no people came to visit any house like they did the house of Zakariyya. The word spread among the Children of Israel and the people were saying, `Verily, her partner (in fornication) was Yusuf, because there was no one else in the temple with her except him.'

The scholars of Tafsir have differed over the interpretation of who was calling out.

Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ</div><p>(Then cried unto her from below her,) \"This is referring to `Isa bin Maryam.\" Likewise, `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said, \"This is referring to her son (`Isa).\" This is also one of the two opinions reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr -- that it was her son, `Isa, speaking. Sa`id said, \"Have you not heard Allah saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ</div><p>(Then she pointed to him.) Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jarir preferred this opinion in his Tafsir.

This was said by Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin `Abbad bin Ja`far, and it is one of the two opinions reported from Qatadah. It is also the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. However, the first view seems to be the most obvious meaning. For this reason, Allah said after it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُزِّى إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ</div><p>(And shake the trunk of date palm towards you,) meaning, \"Grab the trunk of the date-palm tree and shake it towards yourself.\" Therefore, Allah blessed her by giving her food and drink. Then He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُسَـقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَباً جَنِيّاًفَكُلِى وَاشْرَبِى وَقَرِّى عَيْناً</div><p>(It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and rejoice.) Meaning to be happy. This is why `Amr bin Maymun said, \"Nothing is better for the woman confined in childbed than dried dates and fresh dates.\" Then he recited this noble Ayah.

The meaning here is that in their Law, when fasting, it was forbidden for them to eat and speak. As-Suddi, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd have all stated this view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"When `Isa said to Maryam,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِى</div><p>(Grieve not) She said, `How can I not grieve when you are with me and I have no husband nor am I an owned slave woman What excuse do I have with the people Woe unto me, if I had only died before this, and had been a thing forgotten and unknown.'

    "<h2>Maryam with Al-Masih before the People, Their Rejection of Her and His Reply to Them</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs of Maryam's situation when she was commanded to fast that day and not to speak to any human being. For verily, her affair would be taken care of and her proof would be established. Thus, she accepted the command of Allah and she readily received His decree. She took her child and brought him to her people, carrying him. When they saw her like this they made a big deal about her situation and they sternly protested against of it, and</p><p>قَالُواْ يمَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئاً فَرِيّاً</p><p>(They said: \"O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariy.\") Fariy means a mighty thing. This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Nawf Al-Bikali that he said, \"Her people went out searching for her, she was from a family that was blessed with prophethood and nobility. However, they could not find any trace of her. They came across a cow herder and they asked him, `Have you seen a girl whose description is such and such' He replied, `No, but tonight I saw my cows doing something that I've never seen them do before.' They asked, `What did you see' He said, `Tonight I saw them prostrating in the direction of that valley.\"' `Abdullah bin Ziyad said (adding to the narration), \"I memorized from Sayyar that he (the cattle herder) said, `I saw a radiant light.' \" So they went towards the direction that he told him, and Maryam was coming towards them from that direction. When she saw them she sat down and she was holding her child in her lap.

This means, \"O one resembling Harun (Aaron) in worship.\"</p><p>مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ امْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيّاً</p><p>(Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman.) They meant, \"You are from a good, pure family, well-known for its righteousness, worship and abstinence from worldy indulgence. How could you do such a thing\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah and As-Suddi both said, \"It was said to her,</p><p>يأُخْتَ هَـرُونَ</p><p>(O sister of Harun!) referring to the brother of Musa, because she was of his descendants. This is similar to the saying, `O brother of Tamim,' to one who is from the Tamimi tribe, and `O brother of Mudar,' to one who is from the Mudari tribe. It has also been said that she was related to a righteous man among them whose name was Harun and she was comparable to him in her abstinence and worship.

They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle\") This is what took place while they were in doubt about her situation, condeming her circumstances, saying what they wanted to say. At that time they were slandering her and falsely accusing her of a horrendous act. On that day she was fasting and keeping silent. Therefore, she referred all speech to him (the child) and she directed them to his address and speech to them. They scoffed at her because they thought that she was mocking at them and playing with them. They said,</p><p>كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِى الْمَهْدِ صَبِيّاً</p><p>(How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle) Maymun bin Mahran said,</p><p>فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ</p><p>(Then she pointed to him.) \"She indicated, `Speak to him.' They then said, `After she has come to us with this calamity, she now commands us to speak to one who is a child in the cradle!\"' As-Suddi said, \"When she pointed to him they became angry and said, `Her mocking us, to the extent of commanding us to speak to this child, is worse to us than her fornication.' \"</p><p>قَالُواْ كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِى الْمَهْدِ صَبِيّاً</p><p>(They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle\") This means, \"How can someone speak who is in his cradle, in the state of infancy and a child\" `Isa said,</p><p>إِنِّى عَبْدُ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Verily, I am a servant of Allah,) The first thing that he said was a declaration of the lofty honor of his Lord and His being free of having a child. Also, he affirmed that he himself was a worshipper of his Lord. Allah said,</p><p>ءَاتَانِىَ الْكِتَـبَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيّاً</p><p>(He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet.) This was a declaration of innocence for his mother from the immorality that was attributed to her. Nawf Al-Bikali said, \"When they said what they said to his mother, he (`Isa) was nursing from her breast. At their statement he released the breast from his mouth and reclined on his left saying,</p><p>إِنِّى عَبْدُ اللَّهِ ءَاتَانِىَ الْكِتَـبَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيّاً</p><p>(Verily, I am a servant of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet.) And he continued speaking until he said,</p><p>مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً</p><p>(as long as I live.)\" Concerning his statement,</p><p>وَجَعَلَنِى مُبَارَكاً أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ</p><p>(And He has made me blessed wherever I be,) Mujahid, `Amr bin Qays and Ath-Thawri all said that this means, \"And He made me a teacher of goodness.\" In another narration from Mujahid, he said, \"A person of great benefit.\" Ibn Jarir reported from Wuhayb bin Al-Ward, a freed slave of the Bani Makhzum tribe, that he said, \"A scholar met another scholar who had more knowledge than himself. So he said to him, `May Allah have mercy upon you, what acts of mine should I perform openly' The other replied, `Commanding good and forbidding evil, for verily, it is the religion of Allah, which He sent His Prophets with to His servants.' The scholars have indeed agreed upon the statement of Allah,</p><p>وَجَعَلَنِى مُبَارَكاً أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ</p><p>(And He has made me blessed wherever I be,) Then it was said, `What was his blessing' He (Wuhayb) replied, `Commanding good and forbidding evil wherever he was.' \" His saying,</p><p>وَأَوْصَانِى بِالصَّلَوةِ وَالزَّكَوةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً</p><p>(and He has enjoined on me Awsani Salah and Zakah, as long as I live.) This is similar to the statement of Allah to Muhammad ﷺ,</p><p>وَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ</p><p>(And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death).) 15:99 `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim reported from Malik bin Anas that he commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَوْصَانِى بِالصَّلَوةِ وَالزَّكَوةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً</p><p>(and He has enjoined on me Awsani Salah and Zakah, as long as I live.) He said, \"Allah informed him of what would be of his affair until his death. This is the firmest evidence against the people who deny Allah's preordained decree.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَبَرّاً بِوَالِدَتِى</p><p>(And to be dutiful to my mother.) This means, \"He (Allah) has commanded me to treat my mother well.\" He mentioned this after mentioning obedience to his Lord, Allah. This is because Allah often combines the command to worship Him with obedience to the parents. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً</p><p>(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him and that you be dutiful to your parents.) 17:23 And He, the Exalted, said,</p><p>أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.) 31:14 Concerning his statement,</p><p>وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِى جَبَّاراً شَقِيّاً</p><p>(and He made me not arrogant, unblessed.) This means, \"He (Allah) has not made me too proud or arrogant to worship Him, obey Him and be dutiful to my mother, and thus be unblessed.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالسَّلَـمُ عَلَىَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدْتُّ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ حَيّاً</p><p>(And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!) This is his affirmation that `he is a worshipper of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and that he is a creature created by Allah. He (`Isa) will live, die and be resurrected, just like the other creatures that Allah has created. However, he will have peace in these situations, which are the most difficult situations for Allah's creatures.' May Allah's peace and blessings be upon him.</p>",

    "<h2>`Isa is the Servant of Allah and not His Son</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says to His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ, `This is the story which We have related to you about `Isa,' upon him be peace.</p><p>قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِى فِيهِ يَمْتُرُونَ</p><p>((It is) a statement of truth about which they doubt.) lThis means that the people of falsehood and the people of truth are in disagreement, of those who believe in him and those who disbelieve believe in him. For this reason most of the reciters recited this Ayah with Qawlul-Haqq (statement of truth) as the subject, referring to `Isa himself. `Asim and `Abdullah bin `Amir both recited it Qawlal-Haqq (statement of truth) referring to the story in its entirety that the people differed about. It is reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited it as Qalal-Haqqa, which means that he (`Isa) said the truth. The recitation of the Ayah with the Qawlul-Haqq being the subject referring to `Isa, is the most apparent meaning grammatically. It has support for it in the statement of Allah after the story of `Isa,</p><p>الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:60 When Allah mentioned that He created him as a servant and a Prophet, He extolled Himself, the Most Holy, by saying,</p><p>مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ</p><p>(It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He.) Means glory be unto Him, He is far exalted above that which these ignorant, wrongdoing, transgressing people say about Him.</p><p>إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" -- and it is.) Whenever He wants something, He merely commands it and it happens as He wills. This is as Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him: \"Be\" -- and he was. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:59-60</p><h2>`Isa commanded the Worship of Allah Alone, then the People differed after Him</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Among those things which `Isa said to his people while he was in his cradle is that Allah was his Lord and their Lord, and he commanded them to worship Him alone. He said,</p><p>فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Meaning, \"That which I have come to you with from Allah is the straight path.\" This means that the path is correct; whoever follows it will be rightly guided and whoever opposes it will deviate and go astray. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(Then the sects differed,) means that the opinions of the People of the Book differed concerning `Isa even after the explanation of his affair and the clarification of his situation. They disagreed about his being the servant of Allah, His Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam and a spirit from Himself. So a group of them -- who were the majority of the Jews (may Allah's curses be upon them) -- determined that he was a child of fornication and that his speaking in his cradle was merely sorcery. Another group said that it was Allah Who was speaking (not `Isa). Others said that he (`Isa) was the son of Allah. Some said that he was the third part of a divine trinity with Allah. Yet, others said that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. This latter view is the statement of truth, which Allah guided the believers to. A report similar with this meaning has been reported from `Amr bin Maymun, Ibn Jurayj, Qatadah and others from the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (later generations). Allah said,</p><p>فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) This is a threat and severe warning for those who lie about Allah, invent falsehood and claim that He (Allah) has a son. However, Allah has given them respite until the Day of Resurrection, and He has delayed their term out of gentleness and confident reliance upon His divine decree overcoming them. Verily, Allah does not hasten the affair of those who disobey Him. This has been related in a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</p><p>(Verily, Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful, (and) severe.) 11:102 In the Two Sahihs it is also reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ، إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</p><p>(No one is more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. Verily, they attribute to Him a son, while He is the One Who provides them sustenance and good health.) Allah says,</p><p>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I punished it. And to me is the (final) return (of all).) 22:48 Allah, the Exalted, also says,</p><p>وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ</p><p>(Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 This is the reason that Allah says here,</p><p>فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) referring to the Day of Resurrection. It has been related in an authentic Hadith that is agreed upon (in Al-Bukhari and Muslim), on the authority of `Ubadah bin As-Samit who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ شَهِدَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَأَنَّ عِيسَى عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَى مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ، وَأَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارَ حَقٌّ، أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنَ الْعَمَل»</p><p>(Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa was Allah's servant and Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam, and a spirit from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are both real, then Allah will admit him into Paradise regardless of whatever he did.)</p><p>أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـكِنِ الظَّـلِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p>",

It has support for it in the statement of Allah after the story of `Isa,</p><p>الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:60 When Allah mentioned that He created him as a servant and a Prophet, He extolled Himself, the Most Holy, by saying,</p><p>مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ</p><p>(It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He.) Means glory be unto Him, He is far exalted above that which these ignorant, wrongdoing, transgressing people say about Him.</p><p>إِذَا قَضَى أَمْرًا فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" -- and it is.) Whenever He wants something, He merely commands it and it happens as He wills. This is as Allah says,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him: \"Be\" -- and he was. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:59-60</p><h2>`Isa commanded the Worship of Allah Alone, then the People differed after Him</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Among those things which `Isa said to his people while he was in his cradle is that Allah was his Lord and their Lord, and he commanded them to worship Him alone. He said,</p><p>فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Meaning, \"That which I have come to you with from Allah is the straight path.\" This means that the path is correct; whoever follows it will be rightly guided and whoever opposes it will deviate and go astray. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(Then the sects differed,) means that the opinions of the People of the Book differed concerning `Isa even after the explanation of his affair and the clarification of his situation. They disagreed about his being the servant of Allah, His Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam and a spirit from Himself. So a group of them -- who were the majority of the Jews (may Allah's curses be upon them) -- determined that he was a child of fornication and that his speaking in his cradle was merely sorcery. Another group said that it was Allah Who was speaking (not `Isa). Others said that he (`Isa) was the son of Allah. Some said that he was the third part of a divine trinity with Allah. Yet, others said that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. This latter view is the statement of truth, which Allah guided the believers to. A report similar with this meaning has been reported from `Amr bin Maymun, Ibn Jurayj, Qatadah and others from the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (later generations). Allah said,</p><p>فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) This is a threat and severe warning for those who lie about Allah, invent falsehood and claim that He (Allah) has a son. However, Allah has given them respite until the Day of Resurrection, and He has delayed their term out of gentleness and confident reliance upon His divine decree overcoming them. Verily, Allah does not hasten the affair of those who disobey Him. This has been related in a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»</p><p>(Verily, Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَكَذلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ الْقُرَى وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p>(Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful, (and) severe.) 11:102 In the Two Sahihs it is also reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ، إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</p><p>(No one is more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. Verily, they attribute to Him a son, while He is the One Who provides them sustenance and good health.) Allah says,</p><p>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I punished it. And to me is the (final) return (of all).) 22:48 Allah, the Exalted, also says,</p><p>وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ غَـفِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ</p><p>(Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 This is the reason that Allah says here,</p><p>فَوْيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهِدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) referring to the Day of Resurrection. It has been related in an authentic Hadith that is agreed upon (in Al-Bukhari and Muslim), on the authority of `Ubadah bin As-Samit who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ شَهِدَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَأَنَّ عِيسَى عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَى مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ، وَأَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارَ حَقٌّ، أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنَ الْعَمَل»</p><p>(Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa was Allah's servant and Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam, and a spirit from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are both real, then Allah will admit him into Paradise regardless of whatever he did.)</p><p>أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـكِنِ الظَّـلِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p>",
    "<h2>The Disbeliever's warning of the Day of Distress</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says informing about the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection that they will be made to have the clearest hearing and sight. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا</p><p>(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord! We have now seen and heard.\") 32:12 They will say that when it will not benefit them, nor will it be of any use to them. If they had used these senses properly before seeing the torment, then it would have brought them some benefit and saved them from the Allah's punishment. This is why Allah says,</p><p>أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ</p><p>(How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear,) This means that no one will hear and see better than they will.</p><p>يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</p><p>(the day when they will appear before Us.) The Day of Resurrection.</p><p>لَـكِنِ الظَّـلِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ</p><p>(But the wrongdoers today are...) now, in the life of this world,</p><p>فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(...in plain error.) They do not hear, see or think. When they are requested to follow guidance, they are not guided and they succumb to those things that do not benefit them. Then, Allah says,</p><p>وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ</p><p>(And warn them of the Day of grief and regrets,) warn the creation of the Day of Distress,</p><p>إِذْ قُضِىَ الاٌّمْرُ</p><p>(when the case has been decided,) when the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will be sorted out, and everyone will reach his final abode which he was destined to remain in forever.</p><p>وَهُمْ</p><p>(while (now) they are) today, in the present life of this world,</p><p>فِى غَفْلَةٍ</p><p>(in a state of carelessness.) with the warning of the Day of grief and regret, they are heedless.</p><p>وَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(and they believe not.) meaning they do not believe that it is true. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ وَأَهْلُ النَّارِ النَّارَ، يُجَاءُ بِالْمَوْتِ كَأَنَّهُ كَبْشٌ أَمْلَحُ فَيُوقَفُ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ، فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا، قَالَ: فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ وَيَقُولُونَ:نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ قَالَ: فَيُقَالُ: يَاأَهْلَ النَّارِ، هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ وَيَقُولُونَ: نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ قَالَ: فَيُؤْمَرُ بِهِ فَيُذْبَحُ، قَالَ: وَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ، خُلُودٌ وَلَا مَوْتَ، وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ، خُلُودٌ وَلَا مَوْت»</p><p>(When the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of the Hellfire enter the Hellfire, death will be brought in the form of a handsome ram and it will be placed between Paradise and the Hellfire. Then, it will be said, \"O people of Paradise, do you know what this is\" Then, they will turn their gazes and look, and they will say, \"Yes, this is death.\" Then, it will be said, \"O people of the Hellfire, do you know what this is\" Then, they will turn their gazes and look, and they will say, \"Yes, this is death.\" Then, the order will be given for it to be slaughtered and it will be said, \"O people of Paradise, eternity and no more death, O people of Hellfire, eternity and no more death.\") Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِىَ الاٌّمْرُ وَهُمْ فِى غَفْلَةٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And warn them of the Day of grief and regret, when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not.) Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ made a gesture with his hand and said,</p><p>«أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا فِي غَفْلَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(The people of this life are in the state of heedlessness of this life.) Thus recorded Imam Ahmad and it was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs with wording similar to this. It is reported from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that he mentioned a story in which he said, \"There is not a soul except that it will see a residence in Paradise and a residence in the Hellfire, and this will be the Day of distress. So the people of the Hellfire will see the residence that Allah prepared for them if they had believed. Then, it will be said to them, `If you had believed and worked righteous deeds, you would have had this, which you see in Paradise.' Then, they will be overcome with distress and grief. Likewise, the people of Paradise will see the residence that is in the Hellfire and it will be said to them, `If Allah had not bestowed His favor upon you (this would have been your place).' \" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَرِثُ الاٌّرْضَ وَمَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We will inherit the earth and whatsoever is thereon. And to Us they all shall be returned.) Allah is informing that He is the Creator, the Owner and the Controller of all matters. All of the creation will be destroyed and only He, the Most High and Most Holy, will remain. There is no one who can claim absolute ownership and control of affairs besides Him. He is the Inheritor of all His creation. He is the Eternal, Who will remain after they are gone and He is the Judge of their affairs. Therefore, no soul will be done any injustice, nor wronged even the weight of a mosquito or an atom. Ibn Abi Hatim recor- ded that Hazm bin Abi Hazm Al-Quta`i said, \"`Umar bin `Abdul-Aziz wrote to `Abdul-Hamid bin `Abdur-Rahman, who was the governor of Kufah: `Thus, to proceed: Verily, Allah prescribed death for His creatures when He created them and He determined their final destination. He said in that which He revealed in His truthful Book, which He guarded with His knowledge and made His angels testify to its preservation, that He will inherit the earth and all who are on it, and they will all be returned to Him.\"'</p>",

All of the creation will be destroyed and only He, the Most High and Most Holy, will remain. There is no one who can claim absolute ownership and control of affairs besides Him. He is the Inheritor of all His creation. He is the Eternal, Who will remain after they are gone and He is the Judge of their affairs. Therefore, no soul will be done any injustice, nor wronged even the weight of a mosquito or an atom. Ibn Abi Hatim recor- ded that Hazm bin Abi Hazm Al-Quta`i said, \"`Umar bin `Abdul-Aziz wrote to `Abdul-Hamid bin `Abdur-Rahman, who was the governor of Kufah: `Thus, to proceed: Verily, Allah prescribed death for His creatures when He created them and He determined their final destination. He said in that which He revealed in His truthful Book, which He guarded with His knowledge and made His angels testify to its preservation, that He will inherit the earth and all who are on it, and they will all be returned to Him.\"'</p>",

    "<h2>The Reply of Ibrahim's Father</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs of the reply of Ibrahim's father to his son, Ibrahim, in reference to what he was calling him to. He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنْ آلِهَتِى يإِبْرَهِيمُ</div><p>(Do you revile my gods, O Ibrahim) This means, \"If you do not want to worship them (the idols) and you are not pleased with them, then at least stop cursing, abusing, and reviling them. For verily, if you do not cease, I will punish you, curse you and revile you.\" This is the meaning of his statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لأَرْجُمَنَّكَ</div><p>(La'arjumannaka.) Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ad-Dahhak and others said this. Concerning His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاهْجُرْنِى مَلِيّاً</div><p>(So get away from me Maliyan.) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid bin Ishaq all said, \"Maliyan means forever.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"For a long time.\" As-Suddi said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاهْجُرْنِى مَلِيّاً</div><p>(So get away from me safely Maliyan. ) \"This means forever.\" Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi both reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاهْجُرْنِى مَلِيّاً</div><p>(So get away from me safely Maliyan.) \"This means to go away in peace and safety before you are afflicted with a punishment from me.\" Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyah Al-Jadali, Malik and others said the same. This is also the view preferred by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>The Reply of Allah's Friend (Khalil)</h2><p>With this, Ibrahim said to his father,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكَ</div><p>(Peace be on you!) This is as Allah said concerning the description of the believers,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الجَـهِلُونَ قَالُواْ سَلاَماً</div><p>(and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they say, \"Salaman peace.\") 25:63 Allah also says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ اللَّغْوَ أَعْرَضُواْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ لَنَآ أَعْمَـلُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَـلُكُمْ سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لاَ نَبْتَغِى الْجَـهِلِينَ </div><p>(And when they hear Al-Laghw (false speech), they withdraw from it and say: \"To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.\") 28:55 The meaning of Ibrahim's statement to his father,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكَ</div><p>(Peace be on you!) \"You will not receive any insult or harm from me.\" This is due to the respect and honor of fatherhood.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّي</div><p>(I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you.) meaning \"But, I will ask Allah to guide you and forgive you for your sin.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِى حَفِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, He is unto me Hafiyya.) Ibn `Abbas and others said that Hafiyyan means, \"Kind.\" Meaning, \"since He guided me to worship Him and direct my religious devotion to Him alone.\" As-Suddi said, \"Al-Hafi is One Who is concerned with his (Ibrahim's) affair.\" Thus, Ibrahim sought forgiveness for his father for a very long time, even after he migrated to Ash-Sham. He continued to seek forgiveness for him even after building the Sacred Masjid (in Makkah) and after the birth of his two sons, Isma`il and Ishaq.

    "<h2>Mentioning Isma`il</h2><p>Here Allah has commended Isma`il, the son of Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah. He (Isma`il) is the father of all of the Arabs of the Hijaz because he was true to what he promised. Ibn Jurayj said, \"He did not make any promise to his Lord, except that he fulfilled it.\" He never obligated himself to do any act of worship with a vow, except that he fulfilled it and carried it out, giving it its full due. Some said,</p><p>صَـدِقَ الْوَعْدِ</p><p>((he was) true to what he promised.) \"This was said about him because he said to his father,</p><p>سَتَجِدُنِى إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّـبِرِينَ</p><p>(If Allah wills you will find me of the patient.) 37:102 So he was truthful in that.\" Being true to one's promise is one of the praiseworthy characteristics, just as breaking one's promise is of the detested characteristics. Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ - كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ اللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do.) 61:2-3 The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَان»</p><p>(The sign of the hypocrite is three things. When he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks his promise; and when he is entrusted with something, he is disloyal to his trust.) Thus, if these are the characteristics of the hypocrites, then behaving contrary to these is a characteristic of the true believer. For this reason, Allah commended His servant and Messenger Isma`il, for he was true to his promise. Likewise, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was true to his promise. He did not promise anyone anything, except that he fulfilled his promise to that person. He also commended Abu Al-`As bin Ar-Rabi`, the husband of his daughter Zaynab, by saying,</p><p>«حَدَّثَنِي فَصَدَقَنِي، وَوَعَدَنِي فَوَفَى لِي»</p><p>(He spoke to me and he told me the truth, and he promised me and he fulfilled his promise to me.) When the Prophet died, the Khalifah (his successor), Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"Whoever received any promise from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or was owed any debt by him, then let him come to me and I will fulfill it on his behalf.\" So Jabir bin `Abdullah came and related that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ قَدْ جَاءَ مَالُ الْبَحْرَينِ أَعْطَيْتُكَ هَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا»</p><p>(If the wealth of Bahrain comes (to me), then I would give you such and such and such.) This meant that he would fill his hands with wealth. Therefore, when the wealth of Bahrain came (to them), Abu Bakr commanded Jabir to come and fill his hands from that wealth. Then, he commanded him to do so again, until he collected five hundred Dirhams. Then, Abu Bakr gave him its double along with it.(i.e. one thousand extra Dirhams). Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً</p><p>(and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet.) In this is a proof of Isma`il's favored status over his brother, Ishaq. Ishaq was only described as being a Prophet, but Isma`il was described with both prophethood and messengership. It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ اصْطَفَى مِنْ وَلَدِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِسْمَاعِيل»</p><p>(Verily, Allah chose Isma`il from the sons of Ibrahim...) Then, Imam Muslim mentions the rest of the Hadith in its entirety. However, this statement proves the correctness of what we have said. Allah said,</p><p>وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّـلَوةِ وَالزَّكَـوةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً</p><p>(And he would enjoin on his family and his people the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.) This is also a beautiful form of praise, a commendable quality, and and upright characteristic. He was commanded in this way because of his persistence in obedience of his Lord, and enjoining his family to do so. This is as Allah said to His Messenger ,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient with them.) 20:132 Also, Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ عَلَيْهَا مَلَـئِكَةٌ غِلاَظٌ شِدَادٌ لاَّ يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Protect yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.) 66:6 This means to command them to do good, forbid them from evil and do not neglect them. If you do so, and they obey your command, the Fire (of Hell) will not devour them on the Day of Resurrection. It has been reported in a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«رَحِمَ اللهُ رَجُلًا قَامَ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَصَلَّى وَأَيْقَظَ امْرَأَتَهُ، فَإِنْ أَبَتْ نَضَحَ فِي وَجْهِهَا الْمَاءَ. رَحِمَ اللهُ امْرَأَةً قَامَتْ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَصَلَّتْ وَأَيْقَظَتْ زَوْجَهَا، فَإِنْ أَبَى نَضَحَتْ فِي وَجْهِهِ الْمَاء»</p><p>(May Allah have mercy upon a man who gets up at night to pray and he wakes his wife. If she refuses to get up, he sprinkles water in her face. May Allah have mercy upon a woman who gets up at night to pray and she wakes her husband.

    "<h2>These Prophets are the Chosen Ones</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says that these Prophets (were favored), but this does not mean only these Prophets who were mentioned in this Surah. Rather, it is referring to all of those who were Prophets. Allah merely changes the implication of the discussion from specific individuals to the entire group of Prophets.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءادَمَ</div><p>(they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam.) As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir both said, \"That which is meant by the offspring of Adam is Idris, and what is meant by the offspring of those `whom We carried with Nuh' is Ibrahim, and what is meant by the offspring of Ibrahim is Ishaq, Ya`qub and Isma`il, and what is meant by the offspring of Isra`il is Musa, Harun, Zakariyya, Yayha and `Isa bin Maryam.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"And that is the distinction of their genealogies, even though Adam gathers all of them (as their original father). This is because among them is he who was not a descendant of those who were on the ship with Nuh, and he that is Idris. For verily, he was the grandfather of Nuh.\" I say that this is the most apparent meaning, which concludes that Idris is amongst the pillars of Nuh's ancestral lineage. The view that this Ayah refers to the ancestral lineage of the Prophets, is the fact that it is similar to Allah's statement in Surah Al-An`am,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَـهَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَـتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ - وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَـقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَـنَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَى وَهَـرُونَ وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الْمُحْسِنِينَ - وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَى وَعِيسَى وَإِلْيَاسَ كُلٌّ مِّنَ الصَّـلِحِينَ - وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطاً وَكُلاًّ فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى الْعَـلَمِينَ - وَمِنْ ءابَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّـتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَنِهِمْ وَاجْتَبَيْنَـهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(And that was our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We raise whom We will in degrees. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing. And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided; and before him We guided Nuh, and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman, Ayyub, Yusuf, Musa and Harun. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And Zakariyya, and Yahya, and `Isa and Ilyas, each one of them was of the righteous. And Isma`il and Al-Yasa` and Yunus and Lut and each one of them We preferred above the `Alamin. And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethern, We chose them, and We guided them to the straight path.)6:83-87 Until Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.) 6: 90 Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْهُم مَّن قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لَّمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ</div><p>(Of some of them We have related to you their story. And of some We have not related to you their story.) 40:78 In Sahih Al-Bukhari it is reported from Mujahid that he asked Ibn `Abbas, \"Is there a prostration in Surah Sad\" Ibn `Abbas replied, \"Yes.\" Then he recited,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ اقْتَدِهْ</div><p>(They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.) 6:90 Ibn `Abbas then said, \"So your Prophet is one of those who have been commanded to follow them. And he is of those who should be followed.\" -- referring to Dawud. Allah, the Exalted, said in this noble Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ ءايَـتُ الرَّحْمَـنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً</div><p>(When the Ayah of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping.) This means that when they heard the Words of Allah, mentioning His proofs and evidences, they prostrated to their Lord in humility, humbleness, praise and thanks for the great favors they were blessed with. The word Bukiyan at the end of the Ayah means those who are crying, and it is the plural of Baki. Due to this the scholars agree that it is legislated to prostrate upon reading this Ayah, in following them and adhering to their manner of worship.</p>",

    "<h2>The Description of the Gardens of the Truthful and Those Who repent</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says that the Gardens (of Paradise), which the penitent will enter, will be Gardens of `Adn, meaning, eternity. These are Gardens that the Most Beneficent promises His servants in the unseen. This means that these Gardens are from the unseen things that they believe in, even though they have never witnessed them. They believe in the unseen out of their strong conviction and the strength of their faith.

Allah's statement here,</p><p>مَأْتِيّاً</p><p>(must come to pass.) This means that it will come to His servants who are striving towards it and they will reach it.

This means, in what is similar to mornings and evenings. This does not mean that there is a night and a day (in Paradise), but they will be living in times that alternate. They will know its lighted times from its lights and illumination. This is as Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ تَلِجُ الْجَنَّةَ صُوَرُهُمْ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ لَا يَبْصُقُونَ فِيهَا،وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ فِيهَا. وَلَايَتَغَوَّطُونَ، آنِيَتُهُمْ وَأَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ وَالْفِضَّةُ وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سَاقِهَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ، لَا اخْتِلَافَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَا تَبَاغُضَ، قُلُوبُهُمْ عَلَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، يُسَبِّحُونَ اللهَ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»</p><p>(The first group to enter into Paradise will have forms like the form of the moon on a night when it is full.

This means, `This Paradise that We have described with these magnificent attributes, it is that which We will cause are pious servants to inherit.' They are those who obey Allah in happiness and times of hardship. They are those who suppress their anger and they pardon people's offenses. This is as Allah says at the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,</p><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ</p><p>(Successful indeed are the believers.

This means, `This Paradise that We have described with these magnificent attributes, it is that which We will cause are pious servants to inherit.' They are those who obey Allah in happiness and times of hardship. They are those who suppress their anger and they pardon people's offenses. This is as Allah says at the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,</p><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ</p><p>(Successful indeed are the believers. Those who are humble in their Salah.) 23:1-2 Until His saying,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaws. In it they shall dwell forever.) 23:10-11</p>",
    "<h2>The Description of the Gardens of the Truthful and Those Who repent</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says that the Gardens (of Paradise), which the penitent will enter, will be Gardens of `Adn, meaning, eternity. These are Gardens that the Most Beneficent promises His servants in the unseen. This means that these Gardens are from the unseen things that they believe in, even though they have never witnessed them. They believe in the unseen out of their strong conviction and the strength of their faith. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّهُ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيّاً</p><p>(Verily, His promise must come to pass.) This affirms the fact that this will occur, and that it is a settled matter. Allah does not break His promise, nor does He change it. This is similar to His statement,</p><p>كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَفْعُولاً</p><p>(His promise is certainly to be accomplished.) 73:18 This means that His promise will be and there is no avoiding it. Allah's statement here,</p><p>مَأْتِيّاً</p><p>(must come to pass.) This means that it will come to His servants who are striving towards it and they will reach it. There are those commentators who said,</p><p>مَأْتِيّاً</p><p>(must come to pass.) \"This means it is coming, because everything that comes to you, you also come to it. This is as the Arabs say, `Fifty years came to me, and I came to fifty years.' They both mean the same thing (I'm fifty years old).\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً</p><p>(They shall not hear therein any Laghw.) This means that in these gardens of Paradise there is no ignorant, wasteful and useless speech, like there is in this life. He said,</p><p>إِلاَّ سَلَـماً</p><p>(...but only Salam.) This is an indifferent exception, similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً وَلاَ تَأْثِيماً - إِلاَّ قِيلاً سَلَـماً سَلَـماً</p><p>(No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!) 56:25-26 Concerning His statement,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</p><p>(And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) This means, in what is similar to mornings and evenings. This does not mean that there is a night and a day (in Paradise), but they will be living in times that alternate. They will know its lighted times from its lights and illumination. This is as Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ تَلِجُ الْجَنَّةَ صُوَرُهُمْ عَلَى صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ لَا يَبْصُقُونَ فِيهَا،وَلَا يَتَمَخَّطُونَ فِيهَا. وَلَايَتَغَوَّطُونَ، آنِيَتُهُمْ وَأَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ وَالْفِضَّةُ وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ، يُرَى مُخُّ سَاقِهَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ، لَا اخْتِلَافَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَا تَبَاغُضَ، قُلُوبُهُمْ عَلَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، يُسَبِّحُونَ اللهَ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»</p><p>(The first group to enter into Paradise will have forms like the form of the moon on a night when it is full. They will not spit, nor will they blow their noses therein. They also will not defecate. Their containers and combs will be made of gold and silver and their censers will be of aloeswood. Their sweat will be the fragrance of musk and each of them will have two wives. The marrow of their shins will be visible from beneath the skin due to their beauty. They will not have any disputes between them, or any hatred. Their hearts will be united like the heart of one man. They will glorify Allah in the morning and evening.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim both recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الشُّهَدَاءُ عَلَى بَارِقِ نَهْرٍ بِبَابِ الْجَنَّةِ فِي قُبَّةٍ خَضْرَاءَ، يَخْرُجُ عَلَيْهِمْ رِزْقُهُمْ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا»</p><p>(The martyrs will be upon the banks of a river by the gates of Paradise. Over them will be a green dome. Their sustenance will be brought out to them from Paradise, morning and evening.) Ahmad is the only one who collected this narration. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً</p><p>(And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) \"This means the amount of time equal to night and day.\" Allah said,</p><p>تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً</p><p>(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who had Taqwa.) This means, `This Paradise that We have described with these magnificent attributes, it is that which We will cause are pious servants to inherit.' They are those who obey Allah in happiness and times of hardship. They are those who suppress their anger and they pardon people's offenses. This is as Allah says at the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,</p><p>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى صَلاَتِهِمْ خَـشِعُونَ</p><p>(Successful indeed are the believers. Those who are humble in their Salah.) 23:1-2 Until His saying,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْوَرِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaws. In it they shall dwell forever.) 23:10-11</p>",
    "<h2>The Angels do not descend, except by Allah's Command</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Jibril,</p><p>«مَا يَمْنَعُكَ أَنْ تَزُورَنَا أَكْثَرَ مِمَّا تَزُورُنَا؟»</p><p>(What prevents you from visiting us more than you do) Then this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلاَّ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(And we descend not except by the command of your Lord.) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording it and he related it with the Tafsir of this Ayah.

Then, Jibril came to him and said, `O Muhammad,</p><p>وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلاَّ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(And we descend not except by the command of your Lord.)\"' Allah said,</p><p>لَهُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا</p><p>(To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us,) It has been said that the meaning of \"what is before us\" refers to that which is in this life and \"what is behind us\" refers to the Hereafter.</p><p>وَمَا بَيْنَ ذلِكَ</p><p>(and what is between those two;) This means what is between two blows of the Sur. This is the opinion of Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah and Mujahid. This was also stated by Sa`id bin Jubayr and Qatadah in one narration from them. As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas held this opinion as well.

A statement like this explanation has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and Ath-Thawri. Ibn Jarir also preferred this latter interpretation. And Allah knows best. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيّاً</p><p>(and your Lord is never forgetful.)

    "<h2>Man's Amazement about Life after Death and the Refutation against this Amazement</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs that mankind is amazed that he could be returned to life after death and he thinks that this is something farfetched. As Allah says,</p><p>وَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَءِنَّا لَفِى خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you wonder, then wondrous is their saying: \"When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation\")13:5 Allah also says,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الإِنسَـنُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مٌّبِينٌ - وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ - قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Does not man see that We have created him from Nutfah.

This means that He, the Exalted, created the human being while he was nothing. So can he not repeat this creation after the human had actually become something Similalry Allah says;</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger ﷺ of Allah said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: كَذَّبَنِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ أَنْ يُكَذِّبَنِي، وَآذَانِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ أَنْ يُؤْذِيَنِي، أَمَّا تَكْذِيبُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ لَنْ يُعِيدَنِي كَمَا بَدَأَنِي، وَلَيْسَ أَوَّلُ الْخَلْقِ بِأَهْوَنَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ آخِرِهِ، وَأَمَّا أَذَاهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ إِنَّ لِي وَلَدًا وَأَنَا الْأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَد»</p><p>(Allah, the Exalted said, \"The son of Adam denies Me and he has no right to deny Me.

Yet, the second creation is not more difficult upon Me than the first. His harming Me is his statement that I have a son. Yet, I am One Alone, the Self-Sufficient Whom all creatures need. He Who does not beget children, nor was He born and there is none coequal or comparable unto Him.\") Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحْشُرَنَّهُمْ وَالشَّيَـطِينَ</p><p>(So by your Lord, surely We shall gather them together, and the Shayatin,) The Lord, Blessed be He the Most High, swears by His Noble Self that He will definitely gather all of those who worshipped other than Allah and their devils as well.</p><p>ثُمَّ لَنُحْضِرَنَّهُمْ حَوْلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيّاً</p><p>(then We shall bring them round Hell, Jithiyya.)

Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ</p><p>(Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect) This means from every nation. This is what Mujahid said.</p><p>أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَـنِ عِتِيّاً</p><p>(all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.) Ath-Thawri reported from `Ali bin Al-Aqmar, from Abu Al-Ahwas, from Ibn Mas`ud that he said, \"The first of them will be bound to the last of them until their number is complete. Then, they will be brought all together. Then, Allah will begin with the greatest of them in crime and continue in succession. That is Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَـنِ عِتِيّاً</p><p>(Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.)

The last of them will say to the first of them: \"Our Lord! These misled us, so give them a double torment of the Fire.\") Until His saying,</p><p>بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(For what you used to earn.) 7:38-39 The first of them will say to the last of them: \"Your were not better than us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ لَنَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِالَّذِينَ هُمْ أَوْلَى بِهَا صِلِيّاً</p><p>(Then, verily, We know best those who are most worthy of being burnt therein.) Then, at this point Allah attaches one piece of information to another. The meaning here is that Allah best knows which of His creatures deserve to be burned in the fire of Hell and remain there forever and who deserves to have his punishment doubled. This is as He says in the Ayah that was previously mentioned,</p><p>قَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(He will say: \"For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.\") 7:38</p>",

In the Two Sahihs there is a Hadith reported from Az-Zuhri, from Sa`id from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَمُوتُ لِأَحَدٍ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ ثَلَاثَةٌ مِنَ الْوَلَدِ تَمَسُّهُ النَّارُ إِلَّا تَحِلَّةَ الْقَسَم»</p><p>(No one of the Muslims who has had three children, who all died, will be touched by the Hellfire, except for an oath that must be fulfilled.) `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا</p><p>(There is not one of you but will pass over it;) \"The passing of the Muslims (over the Hellfire) means their passing over a bridge that is over it.

Therefore, their passing over the bridge and their speed will be based upon their deeds that they did in this life. Then, the believers who performed major sins will be allowed intercession. The angels, the Prophets and the believers will all intercede. Thus, a large number of the sinners will be allowed to come out of Hell. The fire will have devoured much of their bodies, except the places of prostration on their faces. Their removal from the Hellfire will be due to the faith in their hearts. The first to come out will be he who has the weight of a Dinar of faith in his heart. Then, whoever has the next least amount after him. Then, whoever is next to that after him, and so forth. This will continue until the one who has the tiniest hint of faith in his heart, equal to the weight of an atom. Then, Allah will take out of the Fire whoever said \"La ilaha illallah,\" even one day of his entire life, even if he never performed any good deed. After this, no one will remain in the Hellfire, except those it is obligatory upon to remain in the Hellfire forever. This has been reported in many authentic Hadiths from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. This is why Allah says,</p><p>ثُمَّ نُنَجِّى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ الظَّـلِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً</p><p>(Then We shall save those who had Taqwa.

    "<h2>Everyone will be brought to Hell, then the Righteous will be saved</h2><p>Ibn Jarir reported from `Abdullah that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا</p><p>(There is not one of you but will pass over it.) \"The bridge over Hell is like the sharp edge of a sword. The first group to cross it will pass like a flash of lightning. The second group will pass like the wind. The third group will pass like the fastest horse. The fourth group will pass like the fastest cow.

This is in refutation of thier argument about their nice dwellings and splendid places of gathering. This is a challenge against the idolators who claim that they were following guidance in what they were doing. This is similar to the challenge that Allah mentions about the Jews when He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ إِن زَعمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other people, then long for death if you are truthful.) 62:6 Meaning, `Supplicate for death to come to those who are following falsehood among us if you truly claim to be upon the truth. If you are true, then this supplication will not harm you.' But they refused to do so. An extensive discussion of this has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, and to Allah is the praise. Likewise, Allah mentioned the challenge that was given to the Christians in Surah Al `Imran, when they were persistent in their disbelief and continued in their transgression. They refused to give up their exaggerating claim that `Isa was the son of Allah. Therefore, Allah mentioned His arguments and proofs against the worship of `Isa, and that he was merely a creature like Adam. After this, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ </div><p>(Then whoever disputes with you about him after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say: \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the curse of Allah upon those who lie.\") 3:61 However, they (the Christians) also retreated from this challenge.</p>",
    "<h2>Increasing Guidance of Those Who are guided</h2><p>After Allah mentions the extended time and respite that is allowed to those who are in misguidance, increasing them in misguidance, He informs of the increase in guidance of those who are rightly guided. Similarly He says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً</div><p>(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: \"Which of you has had his faith increased by it\") 9:124 And the following Ayah also shows this. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْبَـقِيَاتُ الصَّـلِحَاتُ</div><p>(And the righteous good deeds that last) Its explanation has already preceded in Surat Al-Kahf, along with a lengthy discussion concerning it and the related Hadiths.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا</div><p>((they) are better with your Lord for reward.) meaning the recompense and reward.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَخَيْرٌ مَّرَدّاً</div><p>(and better for resort.) meaning in the final outcome, the result for its doer.</p>",

Creation will almost cease existing before the association of partners with Allah, due to His Greatness. Just as the idolator does not benefit by his good deeds because of associating partners with Allah, we hope that Allah would forgive the sins of those who believed in His absolute Oneness by worshipping Him alone. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَقِّنُوا مَوْتَاكُمْ شَهَادَةَ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَمَنْ قَالَهَا عِنْدَ مَوْتِهِ وَجَبَتْ لَهُ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(Encourage your dying people to testify to La ilaha illallah, for whoever says it at the time of their death, they will definitely enter into Paradise.)

Then he said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ جِيءَ بِالسَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرَضِينَ، وَمَا فِيهِنَّ وَمَا بَيْنَهُنَّ وَمَا تَحْتَهُنَّ، فَوُضِعْنَ فِي كِفَّةِ الْمِيزَانِ،وَوُضِعَتْ شَهَادَةُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ فِي الْكِفَّةِ الْأُخْرى لَرَجَحَتْ بِهِن»</p><p>(I swear by He Whom my soul is in His Hand, if the heavens and the earths, and all that is in them, between them and under them, were brought and placed in a balance of a scale, and the testimony of La ilaha illallah was placed on the other side of the scale, the testimony would outweigh all of it.) This was recorded by Ibn Jarir and it is supported by the Hadith related to the story of the card. And Allah knows best. Ad-Dahhak said,</p><p>تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ</p><p>(Whereby the heavens are almost torn,) \"This means to be split apart into pieces due to the fear of the magnificence of Allah.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p><p>وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ</p><p>(and the earth is split asunder,) \"This is due to its anger on behalf of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.\"</p><p>وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً</p><p>(and the mountains Hadda.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means to be torn down.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Haddan means some of it is broken by other parts of it in succession.\" Imam Ahmad reported from Abu Musa that he said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا أَحَدَ أَصْبَرُ عَلَى أَذىً سَمِعَهُ مِنَ اللهِ إِنَّهُ يُشْرَكُ بِهِ وَيُجْعَلُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ، وَهُوَ يُعَافِيهِمْ وَيَدْفَعُ عَنْهُمْ وَيَرْزُقُهُم»</p><p>(There is no one more patient than Allah concerning something harmful that he hears. For verily, partners are associated with Him and a son is ascribed to Him, while He is the One Who gives them good health, protects them and sustains them.) This narration is also recorded in the Two Sahihs. In one wording of it he said,</p><p>«إِنَّهُمْ يَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ وَلَدًا وَهُوَ يَرْزُقُهُمْ وَيُعَافِيهِم»</p><p>(...that they attribute a son to Him, while He is the One Who sustains them and gives them good health.) Allah said;</p><p>وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً</p><p>(But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son.) Meaning that it is not befitting of Him, nor is it appropriate for His lofty majesty and greatness. There is no coequal for Him in His creation, because all creatures are His slaves. This is why He says,</p><p>إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً</p><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a slave. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting.) He knows their number from the time He created them, until the Day of Resurrection, male and female, both the small and the large of them.</p><p>وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً</p><p>(And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) This means that there will be no helper for him and no one to save him, except Allah alone, Who has no partners. He judges His creatures as He wills and He is the Most Just, Who does not do even an atom's weight of injustice. He will not wrong anyone.</p>",

    "<h2>Allah places Love of the Righteous People in the Hearts</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about His believing servants, who work righteous deeds -- deeds that He is pleased with because they are in accordance with the legislation of Muhammad -- that He plants love for them in the hearts of His righteous servants. This is something that is absolutely necessary and there is no avoiding it. This has been reported in authentic Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in various different ways. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا أَحَبَّ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ، فَقَالَ: يَا جِبْرِيلُ، إِنِّي أُحِبُّ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبَّهُ قَالَ: فَيُحِبُّهُ جِبْرِيلُ، قَالَ: ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي أَهْلِ السَّمَاءِ: إِنَّ اللهَ يُحِبُّ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبُّوهُ، قَالَ: فَيُحِبُّهُ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُوضَعُ لَهُ الْقَبُولُ فِي الْأَرْضِ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا أَبْغَضَ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ فَقَالَ: يَا جِبْرِيلُ إِنِّي أُبْغِضُ فُلَانًا فَأَبْغِضْهُ، قَالَ: فَيُبْغِضُهُ جِبْرِيلُ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي أَهْلِ السَّمَاءِ: إِنَّ اللهَ يُبْغِضُ فُلَانًا فَأَبْغِضُوهُ، قَالَ: فَيُبْغِضُهُ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُوضَعُ لَهُ الْبَغْضَاءُ فِي الْأَرْض»</p><p>(Verily, whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, \"O Jibril, verily I love so-and-so, so love him.\" Thus, Jibril will love him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out to the dwellers of the heavens, \"Verily, Allah loves so-and-so, so you too must love him.\" Then the dwellers of the heavens love him and he will be given acceptance in the earth. Whenever Allah hates a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, \"O Jibril, verily I hate so-and-so, so hate him.\" Thus, Jibril will hate him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out amongst the dwellers of the heavens, \"Verily, Allah hates so-and-so, so you too must hate him.\" Then the dwellers of the heavens hate him and hatred for him will be placed in the earth.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported narrations similar to this. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَحَبَّ اللهُ عَبْدًا نَادَى جِبْرِيلَ: إِنِّي قَدْ أَحْبَبْتُ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبَّهُ، فَيُنَادِي فِي السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُنْزِلُ لَهُ الْمَحَبَّةَ فِي أَهْلِ الْأَرْضِ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وُدّاً</p><p>(Whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril (saying), \"Verily, I love so-and-so, so love him.\" Then, Jibril calls out into the heavens and love for him descends among the people of the earth. That is the meaning of the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime: (Verily, those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious will bestow love for them.)) 19:96 This was also reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Qur'an descended to give Glad Tidings and to warn</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ</p><p>(So, We have made this easy) meaning the Qur'an.</p><p>بِلَسَانِكَ</p><p>(in your own tongue,) This is an address to Prophet Muhammad and it means that the Qur'an is in the pure, complete and eloquent Arabic language.</p><p>لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa,) those who respond to Allah and believe in His Messenger ,</p><p>وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً</p><p>(and warn with it the people who are Ludda.) meaning, the people who have deviated away from the truth and are inclined towards falsehood. His saying,</p><p>وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ</p><p>(And how many a generation before them have We destroyed!) means from the nations that disbelieved in the signs of Allah and rejected His Messengers.</p><p>هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً</p><p>(Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them) Meaning, `have you seen any of them or even heard a whisper from them.' Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all said, \"This means any sound.\" Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said that this means, \"Do you see with your eye, or hear any sound\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Maryam. All praises and thanks are due to Allah. Following this will be the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, Allah willing and all praise is due to Allah.</p>",

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا أَحَبَّ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ، فَقَالَ: يَا جِبْرِيلُ، إِنِّي أُحِبُّ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبَّهُ قَالَ: فَيُحِبُّهُ جِبْرِيلُ، قَالَ: ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي أَهْلِ السَّمَاءِ: إِنَّ اللهَ يُحِبُّ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبُّوهُ، قَالَ: فَيُحِبُّهُ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُوضَعُ لَهُ الْقَبُولُ فِي الْأَرْضِ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا أَبْغَضَ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ فَقَالَ: يَا جِبْرِيلُ إِنِّي أُبْغِضُ فُلَانًا فَأَبْغِضْهُ، قَالَ: فَيُبْغِضُهُ جِبْرِيلُ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي أَهْلِ السَّمَاءِ: إِنَّ اللهَ يُبْغِضُ فُلَانًا فَأَبْغِضُوهُ، قَالَ: فَيُبْغِضُهُ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُوضَعُ لَهُ الْبَغْضَاءُ فِي الْأَرْض»</p><p>(Verily, whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, \"O Jibril, verily I love so-and-so, so love him.\" Thus, Jibril will love him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out to the dwellers of the heavens, \"Verily, Allah loves so-and-so, so you too must love him.\" Then the dwellers of the heavens love him and he will be given acceptance in the earth. Whenever Allah hates a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, \"O Jibril, verily I hate so-and-so, so hate him.\" Thus, Jibril will hate him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out amongst the dwellers of the heavens, \"Verily, Allah hates so-and-so, so you too must hate him.\" Then the dwellers of the heavens hate him and hatred for him will be placed in the earth.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported narrations similar to this. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِذَا أَحَبَّ اللهُ عَبْدًا نَادَى جِبْرِيلَ: إِنِّي قَدْ أَحْبَبْتُ فُلَانًا فَأَحِبَّهُ، فَيُنَادِي فِي السَّمَاءِ، ثُمَّ يُنْزِلُ لَهُ الْمَحَبَّةَ فِي أَهْلِ الْأَرْضِ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُ اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وُدّاً</p><p>(Whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril (saying), \"Verily, I love so-and-so, so love him.\" Then, Jibril calls out into the heavens and love for him descends among the people of the earth. That is the meaning of the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime: (Verily, those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious will bestow love for them.)) 19:96 This was also reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Qur'an descended to give Glad Tidings and to warn</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَـهُ</p><p>(So, We have made this easy) meaning the Qur'an.</p><p>بِلَسَانِكَ</p><p>(in your own tongue,) This is an address to Prophet Muhammad and it means that the Qur'an is in the pure, complete and eloquent Arabic language.</p><p>لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa,) those who respond to Allah and believe in His Messenger ,</p><p>وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً</p><p>(and warn with it the people who are Ludda.) meaning, the people who have deviated away from the truth and are inclined towards falsehood. His saying,</p><p>وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ</p><p>(And how many a generation before them have We destroyed!) means from the nations that disbelieved in the signs of Allah and rejected His Messengers.</p><p>هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً</p><p>(Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them) Meaning, `have you seen any of them or even heard a whisper from them.' Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all said, \"This means any sound.\" Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said that this means, \"Do you see with your eye, or hear any sound\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Maryam. All praises and thanks are due to Allah. Following this will be the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, Allah willing and all praise is due to Allah.</p>",

Allah says,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) Juwaybir reported that Ad-Dahhak said, \"When Allah sent the Qur'an down to His Messenger , he and his Companions adh- ered to it. Thus, the idolators of the Quraysh said, `This Qur'an was only reve- aled to Muhammad to cause him distress.' Therefore, Allah revealed,</p><p>طه - مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى - إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى</p><p>(Ta Ha. We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress, but only as a Reminder to those who fear (Allah).) The matter is not like the people of falsehood claim. Rather, whomever Allah gives knowledge to, it is because Allah wants him to have an abundance of good. This like what is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ يُرِدِ اللهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّين»</p><p>(Whomever Allah wants good for, then He gives him the understanding of the religion. ) Mujahid commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"This is like His statement,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you).) 73:20 For, the people used to hang ropes at their chests (to hang on to when tired) in the prayer.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"No, by Allah, He did not make it a thing of distress.

Allah revealed His Book and sent His Messenger as a mercy for His servants, so that the person who reflects may be reminded. Thus, a man will benefit from what he hears of the Book of Allah, it is a remembrance in which Allah revealed what He permits and prohibits. His saying,</p><p>تَنزِيلاً مِّمَّنْ خَلَق الاٌّرْضَ وَالسَّمَـوَتِ الْعُلَى</p><p>(A Revelation from Him (Allah) Who has created the earth and high heavens. ) means, `This Qur'an, which has come to you, O Muhammad, is a revelation from your Lord. He is the Lord of everything and its King. He is Most Able to do whatever He wills. He created the earth with its low depths and dense regions. He created the lofty heavens with their high altitudes and subtleties.' It has been reported in a Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi and others graded as authentic, that the density of each sky of the heavens is the distance of five hundred years travel and the distance between it and the next heaven is also five hundred years. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى</p><p>(The Most Gracious Istawa the Throne.) A discussion concerning this has already preceded in Surat Al-A`raf, so there is no need to repeat it here. The safest path to take in understanding this, is the way of the Salaf (predecessors). Their way was to accept that which has been reported concerning this from the Book and the Sunnah without describing it, reinterpreting it, resembling it to creation, rejecting it, or comparing it to attributes of the creatures. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil.) This means all of this is owned by Him and in His grasp. It is all under His control, will, intent and judgement. He created all of this, He owns it and He is the God of all of it. There is no true God other than He and no Lord other than He. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(and all that is under the soil.) Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"This means that which is beneath the seventh earth.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) This means that He Who revealed this Qur'an, has also created the high heavens and the earth and He knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. As Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth.

Allah knows all of that. His knowledge encompasses that which has passed and that which is in the future and it is one, complete knowledge. In this regard, all of the creatures are as one soul to Him. That is the meaning of His statement,</p><p>مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) 31:28 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Allah!

He is the Lord of everything and its King. He is Most Able to do whatever He wills. He created the earth with its low depths and dense regions. He created the lofty heavens with their high altitudes and subtleties.' It has been reported in a Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi and others graded as authentic, that the density of each sky of the heavens is the distance of five hundred years travel and the distance between it and the next heaven is also five hundred years.

This means all of this is owned by Him and in His grasp. It is all under His control, will, intent and judgement. He created all of this, He owns it and He is the God of all of it. There is no true God other than He and no Lord other than He. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(and all that is under the soil.)

This means that He Who revealed this Qur'an, has also created the high heavens and the earth and He knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. As Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth.

Allah knows all of that. His knowledge encompasses that which has passed and that which is in the future and it is one, complete knowledge. In this regard, all of the creatures are as one soul to Him. That is the meaning of His statement,</p><p>مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) 31:28 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Allah!

His saying,</p><p>تَنزِيلاً مِّمَّنْ خَلَق الاٌّرْضَ وَالسَّمَـوَتِ الْعُلَى</p><p>(A Revelation from Him (Allah) Who has created the earth and high heavens. ) means, `This Qur'an, which has come to you, O Muhammad, is a revelation from your Lord. He is the Lord of everything and its King. He is Most Able to do whatever He wills. He created the earth with its low depths and dense regions. He created the lofty heavens with their high altitudes and subtleties.' It has been reported in a Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi and others graded as authentic, that the density of each sky of the heavens is the distance of five hundred years travel and the distance between it and the next heaven is also five hundred years. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>الرَّحْمَـنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى</p><p>(The Most Gracious Istawa the Throne.) A discussion concerning this has already preceded in Surat Al-A`raf, so there is no need to repeat it here. The safest path to take in understanding this, is the way of the Salaf (predecessors). Their way was to accept that which has been reported concerning this from the Book and the Sunnah without describing it, reinterpreting it, resembling it to creation, rejecting it, or comparing it to attributes of the creatures. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil.) This means all of this is owned by Him and in His grasp. It is all under His control, will, intent and judgement. He created all of this, He owns it and He is the God of all of it. There is no true God other than He and no Lord other than He. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَى</p><p>(and all that is under the soil.) Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"This means that which is beneath the seventh earth.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن تَجْهَرْ بِالْقَوْلِ فَإِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) This means that He Who revealed this Qur'an, has also created the high heavens and the earth and He knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. As Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ الَّذِى يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(Say: \"It has been sent down by Him Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\") 25:6 `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.) \"The secret is what the son of Adam hides within himself, and</p><p>وَأَخْفَى</p><p>(that which is yet more hidden. ) is the deeds of the son of Adam, which are hidden before he does them. Allah knows all of that. His knowledge encompasses that which has passed and that which is in the future and it is one, complete knowledge. In this regard, all of the creatures are as one soul to Him. That is the meaning of His statement,</p><p>مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ</p><p>(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) 31:28 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ الاٌّسْمَآءُ الْحُسْنَى</p><p>(Allah! There is no God but Him! To Him belongs the Best Names.) This means, `He Who revealed this Qur'an to you (O Muhammad), He is Allah, there is no God except Him. He is the Owner of the Best Names and the most lofty attributes.'</p>",

Therefore, Allah revealed,</p><p>طه - مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى - إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى</p><p>(Ta Ha. We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress, but only as a Reminder to those who fear (Allah).) The matter is not like the people of falsehood claim. Rather, whomever Allah gives knowledge to, it is because Allah wants him to have an abundance of good. This like what is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ يُرِدِ اللهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّين»</p><p>(Whomever Allah wants good for, then He gives him the understanding of the religion. ) Mujahid commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"This is like His statement,</p><p>مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ</p><p>(So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you).) 73:20 For, the people used to hang ropes at their chests (to hang on to when tired) in the prayer.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْقُرْءَانَ لِتَشْقَى</p><p>(We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you to cause you distress,) \"No, by Allah, He did not make it a thing of distress.

    "<h2>A Discussion of the Message of Musa</h2><p>From this point, Allah begins to mention the story of Musa, how revelation began to come to Him, and Allah's speaking directly to him. This occurred after Musa had completed the time agreed upon between he and his father-in-law that he would herd sheep. He was traveling with his family, and it has been said that he was headed for the land of Egypt, after having been away from it for more than ten years. He had his wife with him and he became lost on the way during a cold, wintery night. Therefore, he settled down, making a camp between some mountain passes and mountains that were covered with snow, sleet, dense clouds, darkness and fog. He began to try to make a fire with a kindling device he had with him, in order to produce some light, as was customary. However, it would not kindle anything and it even stopped giving off sparks. While he was in this condition, he saw a fire from the side of the mountain. It appeared to him to be a fire glowing from the right side of the mountain from where he was. He then announced the good news to his family saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى ءَانَسْتُ نَاراً لَّعَلِّى آتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِقَبَسٍ</div><p>(Verily, I have seen a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand) This means a flame from a fire. In another Ayah he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ</div><p>(or a burning firebrand.) 28:29) This is a coal that has a burning flame. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</div><p>(that you may warm yourselves. ) 28:29 This proves that it was in fact cold weather at that time. Concerning his statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِقَبَسٍ</div><p>(some burning brand) This proves that it was dark. In reference to his statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى</div><p>(or find some guidance at the fire.) This means someone who can guide me to the road. This proves that he lost the road. This is as Ath-Thawri reported from Abu Sa`id Al-A`war, from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى</div><p>(or find some guidance at the fire.) \"This means someone who will guide me to the road.

This means that you will be destroyed and ruined.</p><p>وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى</p><p>(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)) 92:11</p><p>وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى</p>",
    "<h2>The First Revelation to Musa</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p>فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا</p><p>(And when he came to it,) This is referring to the fire when he approached it.</p><p>نُودِىَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(He was called by name: \"O Musa!\") In another Ayah it says,</p><p>نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ</p><p>(He was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: \"O Musa! Verily, I am Allah.\")28:30 However, here Allah says,</p><p>إِنِّى أَنَاْ رَبُّكَ</p><p>(Verily, I am your Lord!) meaning, `the One Who is talking to you and addressing you,'</p><p>فَاخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ</p><p>(So take off your shoes;) `Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Dharr, Abu Ayyub and others of the Salaf said, \"They (his sandals) were from the skin of a donkey that was not slaughtered.\" It has also been said that he was only commanded to remove his sandals due to respect for the blessed spot. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>طُوًى</p><p>(Tuwa) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the name of the valley.\" Others have said the same. This is merely mentioned as something to give more explanation to the story. It has also been said that it is a figure of speech, which comes from the command to place his feet down. It has also been said that it means `doubly sacred' and that Tuwa is something that has repetitious blessings. However, the first opinion is most correct. It is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى</p><p>(When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa.) 79:16 Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَنَا اخْتَرْتُكَ</p><p>(And I have chosen you.) is similar to His statement,</p><p>إِنْى اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَـلَـتِي وَبِكَلَـمِي</p><p>(I have chosen you above men by My Messages, and by My speaking (to you).) 7:144 This means over all human beings of that time. It has also been said that Allah said, \"O Musa, do you know why I chose to speak to you directly out of all of the people\" Musa said, \"No.\" Allah then said, \"Because I have not made anyone humble himself as much as you have humbled yourself. \" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَى</p><p>(So listen to that which will be revealed.) \"Now listen to what I say to you and what I reveal to you.\"</p><p>إِنَّنِى أَنَا اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلا أَنَاْ</p><p>(Verily, I am Allah! There is no God but Me,) This is the first obligation upon all responsible people of age, that they know that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاعْبُدْنِى</p><p>(so worship Me,) This means, \"Single Me out alone for worship, and establish My worship without associating anything with Me.\"</p><p>وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى</p><p>(and perform Salah for My remembrance.) It has been said that this means, \"Pray in order to remember Me.\" It has also been said that it means, \"And establish the prayer whenever you remember Me.\" There is a supporting evidence for this second statement in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا رَقَدَ أَحَدُكُمْ عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ أَوْ غَفَلَ عَنْهَا، فَلْيُصَلِّهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، فَإِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى قَالَ:</p><p>وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ لِذِكْرِى</p><p>(Whenever one of you sleeps past the prayer, or he forgets to pray, then let him pray when he remembers it. For verily, Allah said, (And perform Salah for My remembrance.)) In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ نَامَ عَنْ صَلَاةٍ أَوْ نَسِيَهَا فَكَفَّارَتُهَا أَنْ يُصَلِّيَهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، لَا كَفَّارَةَةَلهَا إِلَّا ذَلِك»</p><p>(Whoever slept past the prayer, or forgot it, then his expiation is that he prays it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it other than that.) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ</p><p>(Verily, the Hour is coming) This means that it is established and there is no avoiding it. It will be and it is inevitable. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</p><p>(I am almost hiding it) Ad-Dahhak related from Ibn `Abbas that he used to recite it as, \"I almost kept it hidden -- from myself.\" Ibn `Abbas then would say, \"Because nothing is ever hidden from Allah's Self.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><p>أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</p><p>(I am almost hiding it.) \"This means that no one knows its appointed time except Me (Allah).\" Allah also said,</p><p>ثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً</p><p>(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.) 7:187 This means that its knowledge weighs heavily upon the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لِتُجْزَى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا تَسْعَى</p><p>(that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives.) \"I will establish it and it is inevitable. I will certainly reward every person who does something, according to what he did.\"</p><p>فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ</p><p>(So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.) 99:7-8</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) 52:16 Allah said,</p><p>فَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكَ عَنْهَا مَن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore, let not divert you the one who believes not therein,) The address here is directed towards all individuals who are responsible (and capable of taking heed to this message). This means, \"Do not follow the way of the person who does not believe in the Hour (Day of Judgement) and he only pursues his desires in this worldly life. He disobeys his Lord and only follows his desires. Whoever behaves like these people, then verily he has failed and lost.</p><p>فَتَرْدَى</p><p>(lest you perish.) This means that you will be destroyed and ruined.</p><p>وَمَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى</p><p>(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down (in destruction)) 92:11</p><p>وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى</p>",

    "<h2>The Hand of Musa turning White without any Disease</h2><p>This is the second sign of Musa. That is Allah has commanded him to place his hand into the opening of his garment, as is clearly stated in another Ayah. It mentioned here merely as a passing reference, saying: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ</div><p>(And press your hand to your side:) Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ</div><p>(And draw your hand close to your side to be free from fear. These are two signs from your Lord to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) 28:32 Mujahid said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَى جَنَاحِكَ</div><p>(And press your hand to your side:) \"This means put your palm under your upper arm.\" When Musa put his hand into the opening of his garment and brought it out, it came out shining as if it were a half moon. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(it will come forth white, without any disease) This means without any leprosy, ailment, or disfigurement. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and others. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"He brought it out, and by Allah, it was as if it were a lamp. From this Musa knew that he had surely met his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.\" This is why Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِنُرِيَكَ مِنْ ءَايَـتِنَا الْكُبْرَى </div><p>(That We may show you (some) of Our greater signs.) </p><h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,</h2>Allah commanded Musa to go to Fir`awn to convey the Message Allah said,<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْهَبْ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى </div><p>(Go to Fir`awn! Verily, he has transgressed.) This means, \"Go to Fir`awn, the king of Egypt, whom you left Egypt fleeing from, and invite him to the worship of Allah alone, Who has no partners. Command him to treat the Children of Israel well and to not torment them. For verily, he has transgressed, oppressed, preferred the worldly life and forgotten the Most High Lord.\" </p><h2>The Supplication of Musa</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِى صَدْرِى - وَيَسِّرْ لِى أَمْرِى </div><p>((Musa) said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest, and ease my task for me.\") Musa requsted his Lord to expand his chest for his mission. For verily, He was commanding him with a great task and a weighty affair. He was sending him to the mightiest king on the face of the earth at that time. He was the most arrogant and severe of all people in his disbelief, and He had the largest army and the most powerful kingdom. He was the most tyrannical and the most obstinate of rulers. His case was such that he claimed not to know Allah at all, and that he knew of no god for his subjects other than himself. Along with this, Musa lived in his home for a period of time as a child. He stayed in Fir`awn's own room and slept on his bed. Then, after this, he killed one of their people and feared that they would retaliate by killing him in return. Thus, he fled from them and remained an outlaw during this entire time.

If he had asked for the removal of his affliction in its entirety, it would have been cured for him. However, the Prophets do not ask for any more than what is required.

While she was among them she heard a man say, \"Which brother in this life was the most beneficial to his brother\" The people said, \"We do not know.\" The man said, \"By Allah, I know.\" `A'ishah said, \"I said to myself about his swearing, that he should not swear such an oath, singling himself out as knowing what person was of most benefit to his brother.\" The man said, \"It is Musa, when he asked for prophethood to be bestowed upon his brother.\" Then `A'ishah said, \"By Allah, he has spoken truthfully.\" This is why Allah commended Musa by saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً</div><p>(And he was honorable before Allah.)33:69 Concerning Musa's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى </div><p>(Increase my strength with him.)

Therefore, with Allah having the great authority and the most perfect power, He determined that Musa would not be raised except upon Fir`awn's own bed. He would be sustained by Fir`awn's food and drink, while receiving the love of Fir`awn and his wife.

When her breast was presented to him, he took it and they (Fir`awn's family) were extremely happy for this. Thus, they hired her to nurse him and she achieved great happiness and comfort because of him, in this life and even more so in the Hereafter.

When her breast was presented to him, he took it and they (Fir`awn's family) were extremely happy for this. Thus, they hired her to nurse him and she achieved great happiness and comfort because of him, in this life and even more so in the Hereafter.

    "<h2>Choosing Musa to go to Fir`awn and to be Soft and Gentle in His Invitation</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says in His address to Musa that he had lived among the people of Madyan, avoiding Fir`awn and his chiefs. He worked as a shepherd for his father-in-law until the appointed time for his work ended. Then he met the decree of Allah and His predetermined will, without him having any set appointment. This entire situation was under the control of Allah, Blessed be He, the Most High. He compels His servants and His creatures to whatever end He wills. This is why Allah says,</p><p>ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يمُوسَى</p><p>(Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) Mujahid said, \"For a set appointment.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar reported from Qatadah that he said,</p><p>ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يمُوسَى</p><p>(Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) \"For the decree of messengership and prophethood.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى</p><p>(And I have chosen you for Myself.) This means, \"I have chosen you and selected you to be a Messenger for Myself. This is as I wish and according to My will.\" Concerning the Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْتَقَى آدَمُ وَمُوسَى فَقَالَ مُوسَى: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَشْقَيْتَ النَّاسَ وَأَخْرَجْتَهُمْ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، فَقَالَ آدَمُ: وَأَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَتِهِ وَاصْطَفَاكَ لِنَفْسِهِ، وَأَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكَ التَّوْرَاةَ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، قَالَ: فَوَجَدْتَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Adam and Musa met, and Musa said, \"You are the one who made things difficult for mankind and you caused them to be evicted from Paradise.\" Adam said, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Message, and He selected you for Himself and He revealed the Tawrah to you\" Musa replied, \"Yes.\" Then Adam said, \"Did you find that it was preordained upon me before He (Allah) created me\" Musa replied, \"Yes.\" Therefore, Adam defeated Musa's argument.) Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>اذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَأَخُوكَ بِـَايَـتِى</p><p>(Go you and your brother with My Ayat,) This means with My proofs, evidences and miracles.</p><p>وَلاَ تَنِيَا فِى ذِكْرِى</p><p>(And do not, you both, slacken and become weak in My remembrance.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah related from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"This means do not be slow.\" Mujahid reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means do not be weak.\" The meaning here is that they should not slacken in the remembrance of Allah. Rather, they both should remember Allah during their meeting with Fir`awn so that the remembrance of Allah can be an aid for them against him. The remembrance of Allah would be their strength and their power that would defeat him. Allah's statement;</p><p>اذْهَبَآ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى</p><p>(Go both of you to Fir`awn, Verily, he has transgressed.) means that he has rebelled and become haughty and insolent against Allah and he has disobeyed Him.</p><p>فَقُولاَ لَهُ قَوْلاً لَّيِّناً لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah).) This Ayah contains a great lesson. Even though Fir`awn was the most insolent and arrogant of people and Musa was the friend of Allah among His creation at that time, Musa was still commanded to speak to Fir`awn with mildness and softness. Therefore, their invitation to him was with gentle, soft and easy speech that is used by one who is a close friend. This is so that the message may have more effect on the souls, and so it would have deeper and more beneficial results. This is as Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p>ادْعُ إِلِى سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ وَجَـدِلْهُم بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ</p><p>(Invite (mankind) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.) 16:125 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah). ) This means that perhaps he will recant from that which he is in of misguidance and destruction,</p><p>أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(or he will fear) meaning that he will become obedient due to fear of Allah. This is as Allah says,</p><p>لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُوراً</p><p>(For such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) 25:62 Thus, to remember means to recant from that which is dangerous, and fear means to attain obedience.</p>",

Allah's statement;</p><p>اذْهَبَآ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى</p><p>(Go both of you to Fir`awn, Verily, he has transgressed.) means that he has rebelled and become haughty and insolent against Allah and he has disobeyed Him.</p><p>فَقُولاَ لَهُ قَوْلاً لَّيِّناً لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah).) This Ayah contains a great lesson. Even though Fir`awn was the most insolent and arrogant of people and Musa was the friend of Allah among His creation at that time, Musa was still commanded to speak to Fir`awn with mildness and softness. Therefore, their invitation to him was with gentle, soft and easy speech that is used by one who is a close friend. This is so that the message may have more effect on the souls, and so it would have deeper and more beneficial results. This is as Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p>ادْعُ إِلِى سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ وَجَـدِلْهُم بِالَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُ</p><p>(Invite (mankind) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.) 16:125 Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah). ) This means that perhaps he will recant from that which he is in of misguidance and destruction,</p><p>أَوْ يَخْشَى</p><p>(or he will fear) meaning that he will become obedient due to fear of Allah. This is as Allah says,</p><p>لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُوراً</p><p>(For such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) 25:62 Thus, to remember means to recant from that which is dangerous, and fear means to attain obedience.</p>",
    "<h2>Choosing Musa to go to Fir`awn and to be Soft and Gentle in His Invitation</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says in His address to Musa that he had lived among the people of Madyan, avoiding Fir`awn and his chiefs. He worked as a shepherd for his father-in-law until the appointed time for his work ended. Then he met the decree of Allah and His predetermined will, without him having any set appointment. This entire situation was under the control of Allah, Blessed be He, the Most High. He compels His servants and His creatures to whatever end He wills. This is why Allah says,</p><p>ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يمُوسَى</p><p>(Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) Mujahid said, \"For a set appointment.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar reported from Qatadah that he said,</p><p>ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يمُوسَى</p><p>(Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) \"For the decree of messengership and prophethood.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى</p><p>(And I have chosen you for Myself.) This means, \"I have chosen you and selected you to be a Messenger for Myself. This is as I wish and according to My will.\" Concerning the Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْتَقَى آدَمُ وَمُوسَى فَقَالَ مُوسَى: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَشْقَيْتَ النَّاسَ وَأَخْرَجْتَهُمْ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ، فَقَالَ آدَمُ: وَأَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَتِهِ وَاصْطَفَاكَ لِنَفْسِهِ، وَأَنْزَلَ عَلَيْكَ التَّوْرَاةَ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، قَالَ: فَوَجَدْتَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Adam and Musa met, and Musa said, \"You are the one who made things difficult for mankind and you caused them to be evicted from Paradise.\" Adam said, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Message, and He selected you for Himself and He revealed the Tawrah to you\" Musa replied, \"Yes.\" Then Adam said, \"Did you find that it was preordained upon me before He (Allah) created me\" Musa replied, \"Yes.\" Therefore, Adam defeated Musa's argument.)

Rather, they both should remember Allah during their meeting with Fir`awn so that the remembrance of Allah can be an aid for them against him.

    "<h2>Musa's fear of Fir`awn and Allah's strengthening Him</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs that Musa and Harun pleaded to Allah, expressing their grievance to him:</p><p>إِنَّنَا نَخَافُ أَن يَفْرُطَ عَلَيْنَآ أَوْ أَن يَطْغَى</p><p>(Verily, we fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he should transgress.)

Know that his forehead is in My Hand, and he does not speak, breathe, or use any force, except by My leave and after My command.

    "<h2>Musa's fear of Fir`awn and Allah's strengthening Him</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs that Musa and Harun pleaded to Allah, expressing their grievance to him:</p><p>إِنَّنَا نَخَافُ أَن يَفْرُطَ عَلَيْنَآ أَوْ أَن يَطْغَى</p><p>(Verily, we fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he should transgress.) They meant that Fir`awn might seize them unexpectedly with a punishment, or transgress against them by tormenting them, when they actually did not deserve it. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said that transgress here means, \"To exceed the bounds.\"</p><p>قَالَ لاَ تَخَافَآ إِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</p><p>(He (Allah) said: \"Fear not, verily, I am with you both, hearing and seeing.\") meaning; \"Do not fear him (Fir`awn), for verily, I am with you and I hear your speech and his speech as well. I see your place and I see his place as well. Nothing is hidden from Me of your affair. Know that his forehead is in My Hand, and he does not speak, breathe, or use any force, except by My leave and after My command. I am with you by My protection, My help and My support.\"</p><p>فَأْتِيَاهُ فَقُولاَ إِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(So go you both to him, and say: \"Verily, we are both Messengers of your Lord...\")</p><h2>Musa admonishes Fir`awn</h2><p>Concerning his statement,</p><p>قَدْ جِئْنَـكَ بِـَايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(indeed, We have come with a sign from your Lord!) meaning with evidence and a miracle from your Lord.</p><p>وَالسَّلَـمُ عَلَى مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And peace will be upon him who follows the guidance!) meaning, `peace be upon you if you follow the guidance.' Because of this, when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wrote a letter to Heraclius, the emperor of Rome, beginning with,</p><p>«بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيمِ، مِنْ مُحَمَّدٍ رَسُولِ اللهِ إِلَى هِرَقْلَ عَظِيمِ الرُّومِ، سَلَامٌ عَلَى مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الْهُدى، أَمَّا بَعْدُ، فَإِنِّي أَدْعُوكَ بِدِعَايَةِ الْإِسْلَامِ، فَأَسْلِمْ تَسْلَمْ يُؤْتِكَ اللهُ أَجْرَكَ مَرَّتَيْن»</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, to Heraclius the emperor of Rome. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. Thus, to proceed: Verily, I invite you with the invitation of Islam. So accept Islam and you will be safe, and Allah will give you a double reward.) Due to this, Musa and Harun said to Fir`awn,</p><p>فَأْتِيَاهُ فَقُولاَ إِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ وَلاَ تُعَذِّبْهُمْ قَدْ جِئْنَـكَ بِـَايَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَالسَّلَـمُ عَلَى مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الْهُدَى - إِنَّا قَدْ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْنَآ أَنَّ الْعَذَابَ عَلَى مَن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(And peace will be upon him who follows the guidance! Truly, it has been revealed to us that the torment will be for him who denies, and turns away.) In His flawless revelation, Allah has revealed to us that torment is prepared exclusively for those who reject the signs of Allah and turn away from His obedience. As Allah says,</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى - وَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا - فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى</p><p>(Then for him who transgressed all bounds, and preferred the life of this world, Verily, his abode will be Hellfire.) 79:37-39 Allah, the Exalted, also says,</p><p>فَأَنذَرْتُكُمْ نَاراً تَلَظَّى - لاَ يَصْلَـهَآ إِلاَّ الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(Therefore I have warned you of a blazing Fire. None shall enter it save the most wretched. Who denies and turns away.) 92:14-16 Allah also says,</p><p>فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى - وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى</p><p>(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he belied and turned away.) 75:31-32 This means that he denied with his heart and turned away by his actions.</p>",

Likewise, the dog's form is not like the sheep's. He also gave creature a suitable spouse, and He influenced everything towards that mate. There is no species of creation that is exactly like another species. They are different in their actions, their forms, their sustenance and their mating.

In this Ayah Musa is saying that our Lord is the One Who created the creation, measured out its ordainment and compelled the creatures to that which He wanted. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الاٍّولَى </div><p>((Fir`awn) said: \"What about the generations of old\") The most correct opinion concerning the meaning of this, is that when Musa informed Fir`awn that his Lord Who sent him is the One Who creates, sustains, ordains and guides, Fir`awn began to argue, using the previous generations as a proof. He was referring to those people of old who did not worship Allah. In other words, \"If the matter is as you say, then what happened to those people They did not worship your Lord. Instead they worshipped other gods besides Him.\" Musa said to him, in response to this, that if they did not worship Allah, then Allah knows precisely what happened to them and He will give them just recompense for their deeds, as is written in Allah's Book (of decrees).

    "<h2>Fir`awn describes Musa's Proofs as being Magic and Their Agreement to hold a Contest</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs of what Fir`awn said to Musa when he showed him the great proof. This great sign to Fir`awn was Musa casting down his stick which became a huge snake, and his pulling his hand out from under his arm while it was glowing white without any illness. At this, Fir`awn said, \"This is magic that you have brought to us to bewitch us and conquer the people, so that they will follow you. Then you will outnumber us.\" Fir`awn then said, \"Your plan will not work. We have magic just like yours, so do not let yourself be deceived by that what you are doing.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِداً</div><p>(so appoint a meeting between us and you,) Meaning, `a day that we can come together to present some of our magic to confront yours.

With this, Musa said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ الزِّينَةِ</div><p>(Your appointed meeting is the day of festival,) That was the day of their celebration and their New Year's festivity.

This day was selected so that all of the people could witness the power of Allah to do whatever He wills. They would see the miracles of the prophets and the futility of magic to contest the supernatural prophetic powers. This is why Musa said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَن يُحْشَرَ النَّاسُ</div><p>(and let the people assemble) meaning all of them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ضُحًى</div><p>(when the sun has risen (forenoon).) meaning in the morning, just before noon.

It is never something hidden, or something for sale. This is why he did not say that the meeting should be at night, but rather, it was to be held during the bright part of the day. Ibn `Abbas said, \"The day of their festivity was the day of `Ashura'.\" As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, \"It was the day of their great celebration.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"It was the day of their great bazzar.\" These statements are not contradictory. I say that Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his armies on a day similar to this, just as is confirmed in the Sahih. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"It was a flat place where all of the people were on the same level, having an equal view of the event.

    "<h2>The Meeting of the Two Parties, Musa's Propagation of the Message and the Magicians</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted informs that when Fir`awn and Musa agreed to an appointed meeting at a specified place and time, Fir`awn began to gather some magicians from the cities of his kingdom. Every person who had any affiliation with magic at that time was summoned, and magic was very widespread and in demand at that time. This is as Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ائْتُونِى بِكُلِّ سَـحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ </div><p>(And Fir`awn said: \"Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.\") 10:79 Then, the day came. It was the day when all of the people gathered, which was well-known, being the day of the festival. Fir`awn was there sitting upon his throne surrounded by the elite officials of his kingdom. The subjects were all standing on his right and his left. Then, Musa came forward leaning upon his stick accompanied by his brother Harun. The magicians were standing in front of Fir`awn in rows and he was prodding them, inciting them and encouraging them to do their best on this day. They wanted to please him and he was promising them and inspiring them. They said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لاّجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَـلِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ </div><p>(Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners He (Fir`awn) said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near (to myself).\") 26:41-42 </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَى وَيْلَكُمْ لاَ تَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً</div><p>(Musa said to them: \"Woe unto you!

If you do this, then you would be lying on Allah.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ</div><p>(lest He (Allah) should destroy you completely by a torment.) This means, `He will destroy you with a destructive punishment that will not spare anything, or anyone.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ افْتَرَىفَتَنَـزَعُواْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ</div><p>(\"...And surely, he who invents a lie will fail miserably.\" Then they debated one with another what they must do,) It has been said that this means that they argued among themselves.

And Allah knows best. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَسَرُّواْ النَّجْوَى</div><p>(and they kept their talk secret.) means, they held secret counsel among themselves about this matter. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ إِنْ هَـذَنِ لَسَاحِرَنِ</div><p>(They said: \"Verily, these are two Hadhan magicians...\") This is a way of speaking with some of the Arabs and this Ayah has been recited according to the grammar of their dialect. There are also others who recite it as, (إِنَّ هَذَيْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ) Which carries the same meaning, \"Verily, these are two Hadhayn magicians.\" This is the popular style of language in Arabic grammar. The grammarians have extensive discussions in reply to the first recitation and its grammatical explanation, but this is not the place for such a discussion. The main point is that the magicians said among themselves, \"You all know that this man and his brother (Musa and Harun) are two knowledgeable magicians who are quite aware of the skill of magic. They want to defeat you and your people today and conquer the people, causing the masses to follow them. They want to fight against Fir`awn and his armies, and they are seeking victory over him. And their ultimate goal is to expel you from your land.\" Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى</div><p>(and to take you away from your exemplary way.) This means, `they want to expose this way (of yours) openly, which is magic.' For verily, they were considered great because of their magic. They had wealth and sustenance because of this magic. They were actually saying, \"If these two (Musa and Harun) are victorious, they will destroy you and expel you from your land. In doing so, they will be the first individuals to do so, and they will be given great power of leadership without you.\" Ibn `Abbas mentioned concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ الْمُثْلَى</div><p>(and to take you away from your exemplary way. ) \"This means their kingdom, which they were in, and their livelihood.\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"This superior way means that which they were upon.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَجْمِعُواْ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ائْتُواْ صَفّاً</div><p>(So devise your plot, and assemble in line.) This means, \"All of you come together in one row, and throw that which is in your hands at one time in order to dazzle the eyes (of the people) and defeat this man and his brother.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْيَوْمَ مَنِ اسْتَعْلَى</div><p>(And whoever overcomes this day will be indeed successful.) meaning \"Between you and us.

Thus, Allah revealed to him at the right moment, to throw what was in his right hand, which was the stick. When he did so, it swallowed what they had made. It became a huge, monstrous creature with legs, a neck, a head and fangs. It went after these ropes and sticks until none of them remained, except that it was devoured and swallowed by this beast. At the same time, the magicians and all of the people were watching with their own eyes, seeing this amazing event in broad daylight. Thus, the miracle was performed and the evidence was clear.

They recognized that it was the truth without any doubt. They knew that no one had any power to do this except for One Who says for a thing \"Be,\" and it is.

This means, \"You say that my people and I are astray and that you (magicians), Musa and his people are following correct guidance, but you will come to know who will be punished and remain punished.\" So when he attacked with this and threatened them, their souls eased them because of their belief in Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

It could be that they were swearing, \"By He Who has created us.\" It also could be connected in meaning to the clear signs mentioned before it.

Therefore, He alone deserves worship and humility and you do not (Fir`awn)!\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقْضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍ</div><p>(So decree whatever you desire to decree,) \"Do whatever you wish and whatever your hands are able to achieve.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا تَقْضِى هَـذِهِ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَآ</div><p>(for you can only decree (regarding) this life of the world.) meaning, \"You only have power in this world and it is a world that will come to an end.

Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى</div><p>(And Allah is better as regards reward in comparison to your reward, and more lasting.) means, \"He is better for us than you.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَبْقَى</div><p>(and more lasting.) More lasting in reward than what you pro- mised us and made us aspire to. It is apparent that Fir`awn (may Allah curse him) was bent upon their punishment, and that what he did to them was a mercy from Allah for them. This is why Ibn `Abbas and others of the Salaf said, \"They woke up in that morning as magicians, but they became witnesses of faith by the evening. \" </p>",

    "<h2>The Magicians admonish Fir`awn</h2><p>The clear intent of this is to be a completion of what the magicians admonished Fir`awn with. They warned him of the vengeance of Allah and His eternal and everlasting punishment. They also encouraged him to seek Allah's eternal and endless reward.

There he will neither die nor live.) 87:11-13</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord made an end of us.\" He will say: \"Verily, you shall abide forever.\") 43:77 Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا، فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يَمُوتُونَ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَلكِنْ أُنَاسٌ تُصِيبُهُمُ النَّارُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ فَتُمِيتُهُمْ إِمَاتَةً حَتَّى إِذَا صَارُوا فَحْمًا أُذِنَ فِي الشَّفَاعَةِ فَجِيءَ بِهِمْ ضَبَائِرَ ضَبَائِرَ، فَبُثُّوا عَلَى أَنْهَارِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ أَفِيضُوا عَلَيْهِمْ، فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ تَكُونُ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْل»</p><p>(The dwellers of Hellfire, who are those who deserve it, they will not die in it, nor will they be living. Rather, they will be a people who will be punished by the Fire due to their sins. It will be gradually killing them and devouring them until they become burnt coals. Then, intercession will be allowed and they will be brought (out of Hell) group by group and they will be spread on the rivers of Paradise. It will then be said, \"O people of Paradise, pour (water) over them.\" Then, they will start to grow like the growing of a seed on the muddy banks of a flowing river.) A man among the people said, \"It is as if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ lived in the desert.\" This is how Muslim recorded this narration in his Sahih. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَن يَأْتِهِ مُؤْمِناً قَدْ عَمِلَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(But whoever comes to Him (Allah) as a believer, and has done righteous good deeds,) whoever meets his Lord on the Day of Judgment as a believer in his heart, then verily, his intentions in his heart will be affirmed to be true by his statements and deeds.</p><p>فَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الدَّرَجَـتُ الْعُلَى</p><p>(for such are the high ranks,) Paradise, which has the highest levels, the most tranquil rooms and the nicest homes. Imam Ahmad reported from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Prophet said,</p><p>«الْجَنَّةُ مِائَةُ دَرَجَةٍ مَا بَيْنَ كُلِّ دَرَجَتَيْنِ كَمَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، وَالْفِرْدَوْسُ أَعْلَاهَا دَرَجَةً، وَمِنْهَا تَخْرُجُ الْأَنْهَارُ الْأَرْبَعَةُ، وَالْعَرْشُ فَوْقَهَا، فَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْس»</p><p>(Paradise has one hundred levels and between each level is a distance like the distance between the sky and the earth. Al-Firdaws is the name of the highest of its levels. From it springs the four rivers and the Throne is above it. Therefore, when you ask Allah, then ask Him for Al-Firdaws.) This narration was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi. In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَهْلَ عِلِّيِّينَ لَيَرَوْنَ مَنْ فَوْقَهُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ الْكَوْكَبَ الْغَابِرَ فِي أُفُقِ السَّمَاءِ لِتَفَاضُلِ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ تِلْكَ مَنَازِلُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَالَ: بَلى، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ رِجَالٌ آمَنُوا بِاللهِ وَصَدَّقُوا الْمُرْسَلِين»</p><p>(Verily, the people of the `Illiyyin will see those who are above them just as you see the fading star in the horizon of the sky, due to the different status of virtue between them. ) The people said, \"O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, these are the dwellings of the Prophets.\" He replied, (Of course. And I swear by the One Whom my soul is in His Hand, (it is for) men who had faith in Allah and they believed the Messengers.) In the Sunan collections this narration is mentioned with the additional wording,</p><p>«وَإِنَّ أَبَا بَكْرٍ وَعُمَرَ لَمِنْهُمْ وَأَنْعَمَا»</p><p>(And verily Abu Bakr and `Umar are of them and they will be most favored.) His saying,</p><p>جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ</p><p>(Adn Gardens,) meaning established as a residence. It is merely used here in reference to the high ranks mentioned previously.</p><p>تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَارُ خَـالِدِينَ فِيهَا</p><p>(under which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever,) meaning that they will abide in it for eternity.</p><p>وَذلِكَ جَزَآءُ مَن تَزَكَّى</p><p>(and such is the reward of those who purify themselves.) One who purifies himself from dirt, filth and associating partners with Allah. This is the person who worships Allah alone, without ascribing partners to Him, and he follows the Messengers in the good they came with all that they claim.</p>",
    "<h2>The Children of Israel leave Egypt</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs that He commanded Musa to journey at night with the Children of Israel, when Fir`awn refused to release them and send them with Musa. He was to take them away from Fir`awn's captivity. Allah expounds upon this in Surahs other than this noble Surah. Musa left with the Children of Israel, and when the people of Egypt awoke in the morning they found that not a single one of them remained in Egypt. Fir`awn became extremely furious. He sent callers into all of the cities to gather together his army from all of his lands and provinces. He said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـؤُلاءِ لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ - وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ </div><p>(Verily, these indeed are but a small band.

Then, at that moment, Allah revealed to Musa, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً</div><p>(And strike a dry path for them in the sea.) So Musa struck the sea with his stick and he said, \"Split for me, by the leave of Allah.\" Thus, it split, and each separate part of the water became like a huge mountain. Then, Allah sent a wind to the land of the sea and it burned the soil until it became dry like the ground that is on land. For this reason Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِى الْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً</div><p>(and strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken...)

    "<h2>A Reminder for the Children of Israel of</h2><p>Allah's Favors upon Them Allah reminds of His tremendous favors upon the Children of Israel and His numerous blessings. He saved them from their enemy, Fir`awn, and He relieved their eyes by drowning him and his hosts all at one time while they watched. Allah said,</p><p>وَأَغْرَقْنَا ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ</p><p>(And We drowned Fir`awn people while you were looking.) 2:50 Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Al-Madinah, he found the Jews fasting the day of `Ashura'.

Then, the Prophet said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ أَوْلَى بِمُوسَى فَصُومُوه»</p><p>(We have more right to Musa (than them), so fast it.) Muslim also recorded this narration in his Sahih. Then, Allah made a covenant with Musa and the Children of Israel on the right side of the Mountain, after the destruction of Fir`awn. This is the Mountain upon which Allah spoke to Musa and He told Musa's people to look at it when they requested to see Allah. It is also the same Mountain upon which Musa was given the Tawrah, while at the same time the Children of Israel began worshipping the (statue of a) calf, as Allah relates in the forth coming Ayat. The manna and quails have previously been discussed in Surah Al-Baqarah and other Surahs. Manna was a sweet substance that descended upon them from the sky and the quail Salwa was a type of bird that would fall down to them. They would fill every pot with them as ample provisions until the following day. This was a kindness and a mercy from Allah upon them. It was a manifestation of Allah's good treatment of them. For this reason Allah says,</p><p>كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَـتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ وَلاَ تَطْغَوْاْ فِيهِ فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِى</p><p>(Eat of the Tayyibat wherewith We have provided you, and commit no transgression or oppression therein, lest My anger should justly descend on you.)

Allah said,</p><p>وَأَغْرَقْنَا ءَالَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ</p><p>(And We drowned Fir`awn people while you were looking.) 2:50 Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to Al-Madinah, he found the Jews fasting the day of `Ashura'. Therefore he asked them about it and they said, `This is the day that Allah gave Musa victory over Fir`awn.' Then, the Prophet said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ أَوْلَى بِمُوسَى فَصُومُوه»</p><p>(We have more right to Musa (than them), so fast it.) Muslim also recorded this narration in his Sahih. Then, Allah made a covenant with Musa and the Children of Israel on the right side of the Mountain, after the destruction of Fir`awn. This is the Mountain upon which Allah spoke to Musa and He told Musa's people to look at it when they requested to see Allah. It is also the same Mountain upon which Musa was given the Tawrah, while at the same time the Children of Israel began worshipping the (statue of a) calf, as Allah relates in the forth coming Ayat. The manna and quails have previously been discussed in Surah Al-Baqarah and other Surahs. Manna was a sweet substance that descended upon them from the sky and the quail Salwa was a type of bird that would fall down to them. They would fill every pot with them as ample provisions until the following day. This was a kindness and a mercy from Allah upon them. It was a manifestation of Allah's good treatment of them. For this reason Allah says,</p><p>كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَـتِ مَا رَزَقْنَـكُمْ وَلاَ تَطْغَوْاْ فِيهِ فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِى</p><p>(Eat of the Tayyibat wherewith We have provided you, and commit no transgression or oppression therein, lest My anger should justly descend on you.) This means, \"Eat from this sustenance which I have provided for you, and do not transgress against My sustenance by taking it without necessity or you will be opposing what I have commanded you.\"</p><p>فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِى</p><p>(lest My anger should justly descend on you.) This means, \"I will become angry with you.\"</p><p>وَمَن يَحْلِلْ عَلَيْهِ غَضَبِى فَقَدْ هَوَى</p><p>(And he on whom My anger descends, he is indeed perished.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means that he will indeed be made miserable.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِنِّى لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً</p><p>(And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds,) meaning, \"Whoever turns to Me in repentance, then I will accept his repentance regardless of whatever sin he did.\" Allah, the Exalted, even accepts the repentance of the Children of Israel who worshipped the calf. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>تَابَ</p><p>(who repents,) This means to turn away from what one was involved in of disbelief, associating partners with Allah, disobedience of Allah or hypocrisy. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَآمَنَ</p><p>(and believes) This means the person's belief in his heart.</p><p>وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحَاً</p><p>(and does righteous deeds,) his action with his bodily limbs. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(and then Ihtada.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means that he then does not doubt.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>ثُمَّ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(and then Ihtada.) \"This means he adheres to Islam until he dies.\" We see here that there is a specific order in which these things are presented. This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><p>ثُمَّ كَانَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالصَّبْرِ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالْمَرْحَمَةِ</p><p>(Then he became one of those who believed and recommended one another to perseverance and patience and recommended one another to pity and compassion.) 90:17</p>",
    "<h2>Musa goes to the Appointment with Allah and the Children of Israel succumb to worship the Calf</h2><p>Allah relates what happened when Musa traveled with the Children of Israel after Fir`awn's destruction.</p><p>فَأَتَوْاْ عَلَى قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَى أَصْنَامٍ لَّهُمْ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى اجْعَلْ لَّنَآ إِلَـهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ ءَالِهَةٌ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ</p><p>إِنَّ هَـؤُلآء مُتَبَّرٌ مَّا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَـطِلٌ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ-</p><p>(And they came upon a people devoted to some of idols. They said: \"O Musa! Make for us god as they have gods.\" He said: \"Verily, you are a people who know not. Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in. And all that they are doing is in vain.\") 7:138-139 Then, Allah made a covenant with Musa of thirty nights after which He added to them ten more nights. Thus, they were forty nights in all. The covenant was that he was to fast these number of days, during both the day and night. Thus, Musa made haste to go to the Mountain and he left his brother, Harun, in charge over the Children of Israel. This is why Allah says,</p><p>وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَومِكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>قَالَ هُمْ أُوْلآء عَلَى أَثَرِى</p><p>(\"And what made you hasten from your people, O Musa\" He said: \"They are close on my footsteps.\") These means that they have arrived and are settled near the Mountain.</p><p>وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَى</p><p>(and I hastened to You, O my Lord, that You might be pleased.) meaning, \"So You will be more pleased with me.\"</p><p>قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِن بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ السَّامِرِىُّ</p><p>((Allah) said: \"Verily, We have tried your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray.\") Allah informs His Prophet, Musa, of what happened to the Children of Israel after he left them, and their deification of the calf that As-Samiri had made for them. During this time period, Allah wrote for Musa the Tablets, which contained the Tawrah. Allah said,</p><p>وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُوْرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation for all things (and said): \"Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein. I shall show you the home of evildoers.\") 7:145 This means, \"I will show you the final outcome of what will happen to those who abandon My obedience and oppose My command.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَرَجَعَ مُوسَى إِلَى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَـنَ أَسِفاً</p><p>(Then Musa returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow Asif.) This means that after Allah informed him of what they were doing, he became extremely angry and upset with them. He was very worried for them. During this time he received the Tawrah, which contained their Shari`ah (Law), this was a great honor for them. For they were a people who used to worship other than Allah. Every person with sound reason and good sense could see that what they were doing was false and foolish. This is why Allah said that he (Musa) returned to them in a state of anger and sorrow. The word for sorrow used here is Asif, which is used to emphasize to the severity of his anger. Mujahid said, \"In a state of anger and sorrow means worried.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"Asif here means in a state of sadness because of what his people had done after him.\"</p><p>قَالَ يَقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً</p><p>(He (Musa) said: \"O my people! Did not your Lord promise you a fair promise...\") This means, \"Did He not promise you in that which I have spoken to you, every good in this life and in the Hereafter, and the good end in the final outcome of things You have already witnessed how He helped you defeat your enemy (Fir`awn) and He made you victorious over him and He blessed you with other bounties as well through His help.\"</p><p>أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْعَهْدُ</p><p>(Did then the promise seem to you long in coming) meaning, `in waiting for what Allah had promised you and forgetting His previous favors and the covenant that He made with you before.'</p><p>أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p>(Or did you desire that wrath should descend from your Lord on you, ) The word `Or' here means `Nay, but.' It is used here to separate between a previous item and a coming item. It is as if it is saying, \"Nay, but you want to make permissible the anger of your Lord upon you by what you have done. Therefore, you have broken your promise to me.\" The Children of Israel said in reply to Musa's blame and rebuke,</p><p>مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا</p><p>(We broke not our promise to you of our own will,) Meaning by our power and our choice. Then, they began making lame excuses and they told him how they got rid of that which they were carrying of Coptic jewelry that they had borrowed from them (the Egyptian Copts) when they left Egypt. Therefore they cast it, meaning that they threw it away. Thus, it became a calf that made a moaning sound that would gradually rise in pitch. This calf was an ordeal, a hindrance and test. This is why Allah said,</p><p>فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى السَّامِرِىُّفَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ</p><p>(\"...that was what As-Samiri suggested.\" Then he took out (of the fire) for them (a statue of) a calf which was mooing.) Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>هَـذَآ إِلَـهُكُمْ وَإِلَـهُ مُوسَى</p><p>(This is your god, and the god of Musa.) \"So they became religiously devoted to it (the calf) and they loved it with a love that they had never loved anything else with before. \" Allah then says,</p><p>فَنَسِىَ</p><p>(but he had forgotten.) This means that he abandoned what he was following of the religion of Islam. This is referring to As-Samiri. Allah says in refuting them and rebuking them, and also explaining to them their folly and foolishness in that which they had done,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) This is about the calf. `Do they not see that it does not respond to them when they ask it and when they speak to it'</p><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) Meaning in their worldly affairs and matters of the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nay, by Allah, the moaning sound of the calf was nothing but wind that would enter into its behind and come out of its mouth, thus causing it to make a sound.\" In a Hadith of Al-Fitun recorded from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, it is mentioned that this calf's name was Bahmut. In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\"</p>",

Allah says in refuting them and rebuking them, and also explaining to them their folly and foolishness in that which they had done,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) This is about the calf. `Do they not see that it does not respond to them when they ask it and when they speak to it'</p><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) Meaning in their worldly affairs and matters of the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nay, by Allah, the moaning sound of the calf was nothing but wind that would enter into its behind and come out of its mouth, thus causing it to make a sound.\" In a Hadith of Al-Fitun recorded from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, it is mentioned that this calf's name was Bahmut. In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\"</p>",
    "<h2>Musa goes to the Appointment with Allah and the Children of Israel succumb to worship the Calf</h2><p>Allah relates what happened when Musa traveled with the Children of Israel after Fir`awn's destruction.</p><p>فَأَتَوْاْ عَلَى قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَى أَصْنَامٍ لَّهُمْ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى اجْعَلْ لَّنَآ إِلَـهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ ءَالِهَةٌ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ</p><p>إِنَّ هَـؤُلآء مُتَبَّرٌ مَّا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَـطِلٌ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ-</p><p>(And they came upon a people devoted to some of idols. They said: \"O Musa! Make for us god as they have gods.\" He said: \"Verily, you are a people who know not. Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in. And all that they are doing is in vain.\") 7:138-139 Then, Allah made a covenant with Musa of thirty nights after which He added to them ten more nights. Thus, they were forty nights in all. The covenant was that he was to fast these number of days, during both the day and night. Thus, Musa made haste to go to the Mountain and he left his brother, Harun, in charge over the Children of Israel. This is why Allah says,</p><p>وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَومِكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>قَالَ هُمْ أُوْلآء عَلَى أَثَرِى</p><p>(\"And what made you hasten from your people, O Musa\" He said: \"They are close on my footsteps.\") These means that they have arrived and are settled near the Mountain.</p><p>وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَى</p><p>(and I hastened to You, O my Lord, that You might be pleased.) meaning, \"So You will be more pleased with me.\"</p><p>قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِن بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ السَّامِرِىُّ</p><p>((Allah) said: \"Verily, We have tried your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray.\") Allah informs His Prophet, Musa, of what happened to the Children of Israel after he left them, and their deification of the calf that As-Samiri had made for them. During this time period, Allah wrote for Musa the Tablets, which contained the Tawrah. Allah said,</p><p>وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُوْرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation for all things (and said): \"Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein. I shall show you the home of evildoers.\") 7:145 This means, \"I will show you the final outcome of what will happen to those who abandon My obedience and oppose My command.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَرَجَعَ مُوسَى إِلَى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَـنَ أَسِفاً</p><p>(Then Musa returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow Asif.) This means that after Allah informed him of what they were doing, he became extremely angry and upset with them. He was very worried for them. During this time he received the Tawrah, which contained their Shari`ah (Law), this was a great honor for them. For they were a people who used to worship other than Allah. Every person with sound reason and good sense could see that what they were doing was false and foolish. This is why Allah said that he (Musa) returned to them in a state of anger and sorrow. The word for sorrow used here is Asif, which is used to emphasize to the severity of his anger. Mujahid said, \"In a state of anger and sorrow means worried.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"Asif here means in a state of sadness because of what his people had done after him.\"</p><p>قَالَ يَقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً</p><p>(He (Musa) said: \"O my people! Did not your Lord promise you a fair promise...\") This means, \"Did He not promise you in that which I have spoken to you, every good in this life and in the Hereafter, and the good end in the final outcome of things You have already witnessed how He helped you defeat your enemy (Fir`awn) and He made you victorious over him and He blessed you with other bounties as well through His help.\"</p><p>أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْعَهْدُ</p><p>(Did then the promise seem to you long in coming) meaning, `in waiting for what Allah had promised you and forgetting His previous favors and the covenant that He made with you before.'</p><p>أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p>(Or did you desire that wrath should descend from your Lord on you, ) The word `Or' here means `Nay, but.' It is used here to separate between a previous item and a coming item. It is as if it is saying, \"Nay, but you want to make permissible the anger of your Lord upon you by what you have done. Therefore, you have broken your promise to me.\" The Children of Israel said in reply to Musa's blame and rebuke,</p><p>مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا</p><p>(We broke not our promise to you of our own will,) Meaning by our power and our choice. Then, they began making lame excuses and they told him how they got rid of that which they were carrying of Coptic jewelry that they had borrowed from them (the Egyptian Copts) when they left Egypt. Therefore they cast it, meaning that they threw it away. Thus, it became a calf that made a moaning sound that would gradually rise in pitch. This calf was an ordeal, a hindrance and test. This is why Allah said,</p><p>فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى السَّامِرِىُّفَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ</p><p>(\"...that was what As-Samiri suggested.\" Then he took out (of the fire) for them (a statue of) a calf which was mooing.)

    "<h2>Musa goes to the Appointment with Allah and the Children of Israel succumb to worship the Calf</h2><p>Allah relates what happened when Musa traveled with the Children of Israel after Fir`awn's destruction.</p><p>فَأَتَوْاْ عَلَى قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَى أَصْنَامٍ لَّهُمْ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى اجْعَلْ لَّنَآ إِلَـهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ ءَالِهَةٌ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ</p><p>إِنَّ هَـؤُلآء مُتَبَّرٌ مَّا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَـطِلٌ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ-</p><p>(And they came upon a people devoted to some of idols. They said: \"O Musa! Make for us god as they have gods.\" He said: \"Verily, you are a people who know not. Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in. And all that they are doing is in vain.\") 7:138-139 Then, Allah made a covenant with Musa of thirty nights after which He added to them ten more nights. Thus, they were forty nights in all. The covenant was that he was to fast these number of days, during both the day and night. Thus, Musa made haste to go to the Mountain and he left his brother, Harun, in charge over the Children of Israel. This is why Allah says,</p><p>وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَومِكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>قَالَ هُمْ أُوْلآء عَلَى أَثَرِى</p><p>(\"And what made you hasten from your people, O Musa\" He said: \"They are close on my footsteps.\") These means that they have arrived and are settled near the Mountain.</p><p>وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَى</p><p>(and I hastened to You, O my Lord, that You might be pleased.) meaning, \"So You will be more pleased with me.\"</p><p>قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِن بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ السَّامِرِىُّ</p><p>((Allah) said: \"Verily, We have tried your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray.\") Allah informs His Prophet, Musa, of what happened to the Children of Israel after he left them, and their deification of the calf that As-Samiri had made for them. During this time period, Allah wrote for Musa the Tablets, which contained the Tawrah. Allah said,</p><p>وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُوْرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation for all things (and said): \"Hold unto these with firmness, and enjoin your people to take the better therein. I shall show you the home of evildoers.\") 7:145 This means, \"I will show you the final outcome of what will happen to those who abandon My obedience and oppose My command.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَرَجَعَ مُوسَى إِلَى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَـنَ أَسِفاً</p><p>(Then Musa returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow Asif.) This means that after Allah informed him of what they were doing, he became extremely angry and upset with them. He was very worried for them. During this time he received the Tawrah, which contained their Shari`ah (Law), this was a great honor for them. For they were a people who used to worship other than Allah. Every person with sound reason and good sense could see that what they were doing was false and foolish. This is why Allah said that he (Musa) returned to them in a state of anger and sorrow. The word for sorrow used here is Asif, which is used to emphasize to the severity of his anger. Mujahid said, \"In a state of anger and sorrow means worried.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"Asif here means in a state of sadness because of what his people had done after him.\"</p><p>قَالَ يَقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً</p><p>(He (Musa) said: \"O my people! Did not your Lord promise you a fair promise...\") This means, \"Did He not promise you in that which I have spoken to you, every good in this life and in the Hereafter, and the good end in the final outcome of things You have already witnessed how He helped you defeat your enemy (Fir`awn) and He made you victorious over him and He blessed you with other bounties as well through His help.\"</p><p>أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْعَهْدُ</p><p>(Did then the promise seem to you long in coming) meaning, `in waiting for what Allah had promised you and forgetting His previous favors and the covenant that He made with you before.'</p><p>أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p>(Or did you desire that wrath should descend from your Lord on you, ) The word `Or' here means `Nay, but.' It is used here to separate between a previous item and a coming item. It is as if it is saying, \"Nay, but you want to make permissible the anger of your Lord upon you by what you have done. Therefore, you have broken your promise to me.\" The Children of Israel said in reply to Musa's blame and rebuke,</p><p>مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا</p><p>(We broke not our promise to you of our own will,) Meaning by our power and our choice. Then, they began making lame excuses and they told him how they got rid of that which they were carrying of Coptic jewelry that they had borrowed from them (the Egyptian Copts) when they left Egypt. Therefore they cast it, meaning that they threw it away. Thus, it became a calf that made a moaning sound that would gradually rise in pitch. This calf was an ordeal, a hindrance and test. This is why Allah said,</p><p>فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى السَّامِرِىُّفَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ</p><p>(\"...that was what As-Samiri suggested.\" Then he took out (of the fire) for them (a statue of) a calf which was mooing.) Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>هَـذَآ إِلَـهُكُمْ وَإِلَـهُ مُوسَى</p><p>(This is your god, and the god of Musa.) \"So they became religiously devoted to it (the calf) and they loved it with a love that they had never loved anything else with before. \" Allah then says,</p><p>فَنَسِىَ</p><p>(but he had forgotten.) This means that he abandoned what he was following of the religion of Islam. This is referring to As-Samiri. Allah says in refuting them and rebuking them, and also explaining to them their folly and foolishness in that which they had done,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) This is about the calf. `Do they not see that it does not respond to them when they ask it and when they speak to it'</p><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً</p><p>(and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good) Meaning in their worldly affairs and matters of the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nay, by Allah, the moaning sound of the calf was nothing but wind that would enter into its behind and come out of its mouth, thus causing it to make a sound.\" In a Hadith of Al-Fitun recorded from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, it is mentioned that this calf's name was Bahmut. In reference to the excuse of these ignorant people, they claimed that they were merely ridding themselves of the jewelry of the Copts. In the process of doing so, they cast the jewelry (into the pit of fire) and ended up worshipping the calf. Thus, they were seeking to rid themselves of something detestable, but wound up doing something even worse. This is similar to an authentic narration reported from `Abdullah bin `Umar. A man from `Iraq asked him about the ruling of mosquitoes' blood if it get on one's garment. The man wanted to know if it is permissible to pray in such a garment or not. Ibn `Umar replied by saying, \"Look at the people of `Iraq. They killed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Al-Husayn, and yet they're asking about the blood of the mosquito.\"</p>",

Likewise, We relate to you the information of the past just as it happened, without any increase or decrease.

And they stand in awe for fear of Him.) 21:28 He also says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ</div><p>(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) 34:23 And He says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَـئِكَةُ صَفّاً لاَّ يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَقَالَ صَوَاباً </div><p>(The Day that Ar-Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious allows, and he will speak what is right.) 78:38 In the Two Sahihs it is reported from the leader of the Children of Adam and the Noblest of all the creatures to Allah, Muhammad : </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«آتِي تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ، وَأَخِرُّ للهِ سَاجِدًا، وَيَفْتَحُ عَلَيَّ بِمَحَامِدَ لَا أُحْصِيهَا الْآنَ، فَيَدَعُنِي مَا شَاءَ أَنْ يَدَعَنِي، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ وَقُلْ يُسْمَعْ، وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ فَيَحُدُّ لِي حَدًّا، فَأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ ثُمَّ أَعُود»</div><p>(I will come under the Throne and I will fall down into prostration. Then, I will be inspired to make praises (of Allah) that I am not able to recall them now. Allah will leave me in this condition as long as He wishes. Then, He will say, \"O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.\" Then, a designated group will be allowed for me (to intercede on their behalf). Allah will then enter them into Paradise and I will return (to repeat the process again). ) The Prophet mentioned doing this four times. May Allah's blessings and peace be upon him and the rest of the Prophets as well. In another Hadith it also mentions that he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ تَعَالَى: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، فَيُخْرِجُونَ خَلْقًا كَثِيرًا، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ نِصْفُ مِثْقَالٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، أَخْرِجُوا مِنَ النَّارِ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مَا يَزِنُ ذَرَّةً، مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ أَدْنَى أَدْنَى مِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَان»</div><p>(Allah, the Exalted, will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a seed's weight of faith in his heart.\" So a large number of people will be brought out. Then He will say, \"Bring out of the Fire whoever has a half of a seed's weight of faith in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of a speck of dust in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of the smallest and tiniest particle of dust of faith in his heart.\") And the Hadith continues. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(He knows what happens to them and what will happen to them,) He encompasses all creation with His knowledge. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً</div><p>(but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.) This is like His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ</div><p>(And they will never encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. ) 2:255 Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ</div><p>(And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"This means that the creatures will be humbled, submissive and compliant to their Compeller, the Ever Living, Who does not die, the Sustainer of all, Who does not sleep.\" He is the maintainer of everything. He determines the affairs of everything and preserves everything. He is perfect in His Self. He is the One Whom everything is in need of and whom nothing could survive without. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً</div><p>(And he who carried wrongdoing, will be indeed a complete failure.) meaning on the Day of Resurrection. For verily, Allah will give every due right to the one who deserved it. Even the ram who lost its horn will be given revenge against the one who had horns. In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</div><p>(Beware of wrongdoing (or oppression), for verily, wrongdoing will be darknesses on the Day of Resurrection.) And the true failure is for whoever meets Allah while associating partners with Him. Allah the Exalted says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</div><p>(\"Verily, associating partners with Me is the great wrongdoing.\") Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً </div><p>(And he who works deeds of righteousness, while he is a believer, then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) After Allah mentions the wrongdoers and their threat, He then commends the pious people and mentions the judgement they receive. Their judgement is that they will not be wronged nor oppressed. This means that their evils will not be increased and their good deeds will not be decreased. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Zulm means an increase that comes from the sins of others being placed upon the person, and Hadm means a decrease. </p>",
    "<h2>The Qur'an was revealed so that the People would have Taqwa and reflect</h2><p>After Allah, the Exalted, mentions that on the Day of Judgement both the good and the evil will be recompensed and there is no avoiding it, He then explains that the Qur'an was revealed as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner in the clear and eloquent Arabic language.

In doing so he used to move his tongue rapidly with its recital. Then, Allah revealed this Ayah. This means that whenever Jibril would say an Ayah, the Prophet would say it with him due to his eagerness to memorize it.

    "<h2>The Story of Adam and Iblis</h2><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, man was named Insan only because he was given a covenant, but he forgot it (Nasiya).\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported the same from Ibn `Abbas. Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</p><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says,</p><p>فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</p><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant.</p><p>فَقُلْنَا يـَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ</p><p>(Then We said: \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife...\") here wife refers to Hawwa'.</p><p>فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَى</p><p>(So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed.) meaning, `Do not be hasty in doing something that will get you expelled from Paradise, or else you will be fatigued, discomforted and worried, seeking your sustenance. But here, in Paradise, you live a life of ease with no burdens and no difficulties.'</p><p>إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَى</p><p>(Verily, you will never be hungry therein nor naked.) The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation.</p><p>وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَؤُا فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَى</p><p>(And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.) These two characteristics are also opposites. Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat.</p><p>فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَـنُ قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى</p><p>(Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away\") It has already been mentioned that he caused them to fall through deception.</p><p>وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ</p><p>(And he swore by Allah to them both: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\") 7:21 It has already preceded in our discussion that Allah took a promise from Adam and his wife that although they could eat from every fruit, they could not come near a specific tree in Paradise. However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</p><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</p><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said,</p><p>وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَى ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَى - ثُمَّ اجْتَبَـهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَى</p><p>(Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.)

However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</p><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</p><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said,</p><p>وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same.

Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.)

Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, \"He abandoned it.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ اسْجُدُواْ لاًّدَمَ</p><p>(And when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam.\") He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him.

Due to this Allah says,</p><p>فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</p><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.)

Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat.</p><p>فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّيْطَـنُ قَالَ يـَادَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَى</p><p>(Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam!

However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</p><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</p><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said,</p><p>وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same.

Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.)

Due to this Allah says,</p><p>فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَى</p><p>(They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.)

Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away\") It has already been mentioned that he caused them to fall through deception.</p><p>وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ</p><p>(And he swore by Allah to them both: \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\") 7:21 It has already preceded in our discussion that Allah took a promise from Adam and his wife that although they could eat from every fruit, they could not come near a specific tree in Paradise. However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ شَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ مَا يَقْطَعُهَا، وَهِيَ شَجَرَةُ الْخُلْد»</p><p>(Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا</p><p>(Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ، كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةُ سَحُوقٍ،فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ، فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إِلَى عَوْرَتِهِ جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمَنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ، فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلَامَ الرَّحْمَنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا، وَلَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً، أَرَأَيْتَ إِنْ تُبْتُ وَرَجَعْتُ أَعَائِدِي إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ؟ قَالَ: نَعَم»</p><p>(Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, \"O Adam, are you fleeing from me\" When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, \"No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise\" Allah replied, \"Yes.\") This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>فَتَلَقَّى ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said,</p><p>وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p>(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, \"They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.\" Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَى ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَى - ثُمَّ اجْتَبَـهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَى</p><p>(Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«حَاجَّ مُوسَى آدَمَ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: أَنْتَ الَّذِي أَخْرَجْتَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ بِذَنْبِكَ وَأَشْقَيْتَهُمْ؟ قَالَ آدَمُ: يَا مُوسَى، أَنْتَ الَّذِي اصْطَفَاكَ اللهُ بِرِسَالَاتِهِ وَبِكَلَامِهِ، أَتَلُومُنِي عَلَى أَمْرٍ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي أَوْ قَدَّرَهُ اللهُ عَلَيَّ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَنِي؟ قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم: فَحَجَّ آدَمُ مُوسَى»</p><p>(Musa argued with Adam and he said to him, \"Are you the one who got mankind expelled from Paradise because of your sin and you caused them grief!\" Adam replied, \"Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me\") Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.) This Hadith has various routes of transmission in the Two Sahihs as well as the Musnad collections.</p>",

    "<h2>Do not look at the Enjoyment of the Wealthy, be patient in the worship of Allah</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, \"Do not look at what these people of luxury and their likes and peers have of nice comforts. For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.\" Mujahid said,</p><p>أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(various groups of them,) \"This means the wealthy people.\" This means, \"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) better than that which We have given them.\" This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءاتَيْنَـكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْءَانَ الْعَظِيمَ لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p>(And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.) 15:87-88 Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى</p><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) 93:5 For this reason, Allah says,</p><p>وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى</p><p>(But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. ) In the Sahih it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</p><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><p>«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</p><p>(The blessings of the earth.) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p>(that We may test them thereby.) \"So that We may put them to trial.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.) This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً</p><p>(O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell).) 66:6 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at `Umar bin Al-Khattab's. `Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray. However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)\" Allah said;</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.) 65:2-3 Allah also says,</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) until,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.) 51:56-58 Thus, Allah says,</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) Verily, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ تَفَرَّغْ لِعِبَادَتِي أَمْلَأْ صَدْرَكَ غِنىً وَأَسُدَّ فَقْرَكَ، وَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ، مَلَأْتُ صَدْرَكَ شُغْلًا وَلَمْ أَسُدَّ فَقْرَك»</p><p>(Allah, the Exalted, says, \"O son of Adam, perform My worship and I will fill your chest with wealth and fulfill your needs. If you do not do so, then I will fill your chest with toil and I will not fulfill your needs.\") It is also reported from Zayd bin Thabit that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا هَمَّهُ فَرَّقَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ، وَجَعَلَ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ، وَلَمْ يَأْتِهِ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَا كُتِبَ لَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَتِ الْآخِرَةُ نِيَّتَهُ، جَمَعَ لَهُ أَمْرَهُ وَجَعَلَ غِنَاهُ فِي قَلْبِهِ، وَأَتَتْهُ الدُّنْيَا وَهِيَ رَاغِمَة»</p><p>(Whoever makes the worldly life his major concern, then Allah will scatter his situation for him (i.e. make it difficult) and his poverty will be placed between his eyes. He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him (i.e. made easy) and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway (in spite of his not seeking it).) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement,</p><p>لَوْلاَ</p><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad ﷺ bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى الصُّحُفِ الاٍّولَى</p><p>(Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former papers (Scriptures)) This means the Qur'an which Allah revealed to him while he was an unlettered man who could not write well and who did not study with the People of the Book. Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord!

If only You had sent us a Messenger,) meaning, `before you destroyed us, so we could have believed in him and followed him.' This is like Allah said,</p><p>فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</p><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe.</p><p>وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</p><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says,</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</p><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat. Then, Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) \"Say, O Muhammad, to those who deny you, oppose you and continue in their disbelief and obstinance.\"</p><p>كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ</p><p>(Each one is waiting,) among you and us;</p><p>فَتَرَبَّصُواْ</p><p>(so wait you too;) This is a command to await (anticipate).</p><p>فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَـبُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ</p><p>(and you shall know who are they that are on As-Sirat As-Sawi.)

The Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya' will follow this, if Allah wills. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>",
    "<h2>Do not look at the Enjoyment of the Wealthy, be patient in the worship of Allah</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, \"Do not look at what these people of luxury and their likes and peers have of nice comforts. For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.\" Mujahid said,</p><p>أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(various groups of them,) \"This means the wealthy people.\" This means, \"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) better than that which We have given them.\" This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءاتَيْنَـكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْءَانَ الْعَظِيمَ لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p>(And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.) 15:87-88 Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى</p><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) 93:5 For this reason, Allah says,</p><p>وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى</p><p>(But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. ) In the Sahih it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</p><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><p>«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</p><p>(The blessings of the earth.) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p>(that We may test them thereby.) \"So that We may put them to trial.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.) This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً</p><p>(O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell).) 66:6 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at `Umar bin Al-Khattab's. `Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray.

This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.\" Mujahid said,</p><p>أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(various groups of them,) \"This means the wealthy people.\" This means, \"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) better than that which We have given them.\" This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءاتَيْنَـكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْءَانَ الْعَظِيمَ لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p>(And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.) 15:87-88 Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى</p><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) 93:5 For this reason, Allah says,</p><p>وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى</p><p>(But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. ) In the Sahih it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</p><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><p>«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</p><p>(The blessings of the earth.) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p>(that We may test them thereby.) \"So that We may put them to trial.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.) This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً</p><p>(O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell).) 66:6 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at `Umar bin Al-Khattab's. `Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray. However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)\" Allah said;</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.) 65:2-3 Allah also says,</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) until,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.) 51:56-58 Thus, Allah says,</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) Verily, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ تَفَرَّغْ لِعِبَادَتِي أَمْلَأْ صَدْرَكَ غِنىً وَأَسُدَّ فَقْرَكَ، وَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ، مَلَأْتُ صَدْرَكَ شُغْلًا وَلَمْ أَسُدَّ فَقْرَك»</p><p>(Allah, the Exalted, says, \"O son of Adam, perform My worship and I will fill your chest with wealth and fulfill your needs. If you do not do so, then I will fill your chest with toil and I will not fulfill your needs.\") It is also reported from Zayd bin Thabit that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا هَمَّهُ فَرَّقَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ، وَجَعَلَ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ، وَلَمْ يَأْتِهِ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَا كُتِبَ لَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَتِ الْآخِرَةُ نِيَّتَهُ، جَمَعَ لَهُ أَمْرَهُ وَجَعَلَ غِنَاهُ فِي قَلْبِهِ، وَأَتَتْهُ الدُّنْيَا وَهِيَ رَاغِمَة»</p><p>(Whoever makes the worldly life his major concern, then Allah will scatter his situation for him (i.e. make it difficult) and his poverty will be placed between his eyes. He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him (i.e. made easy) and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway (in spite of his not seeking it).) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement,</p><p>لَوْلاَ</p><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad ﷺ bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى الصُّحُفِ الاٍّولَى</p><p>(Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former papers (Scriptures)) This means the Qur'an which Allah revealed to him while he was an unlettered man who could not write well and who did not study with the People of the Book. Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger...\") This means, \"If We had destroyed these rejecting people before We sent this Noble Messenger to them and revealed the Mighty Book to them, they would have said,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger,) meaning, `before you destroyed us, so we could have believed in him and followed him.' This is like Allah said,</p><p>فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</p><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe.</p><p>وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</p><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says,</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</p><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat. Then, Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) \"Say, O Muhammad, to those who deny you, oppose you and continue in their disbelief and obstinance.\"</p><p>كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ</p><p>(Each one is waiting,) among you and us;</p><p>فَتَرَبَّصُواْ</p><p>(so wait you too;) This is a command to await (anticipate).</p><p>فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَـبُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ</p><p>(and you shall know who are they that are on As-Sirat As-Sawi.) This means the straight road.</p><p>وَمَنِ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And who are they that have let themselves be guided. ) meaning guidance to the truth and the path of right guidance. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(And they will know, when they see the torment, who it is that is most astray from the path!) 25:42 And Allah said,</p><p>سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ</p><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is liar, the insolent one!) 54:26 This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, and all praise and gratitude is due to Allah. The Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya' will follow this, if Allah wills. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>",

If only You had sent us a Messenger...\") This means, \"If We had destroyed these rejecting people before We sent this Noble Messenger to them and revealed the Mighty Book to them, they would have said,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger,) meaning, `before you destroyed us, so we could have believed in him and followed him.' This is like Allah said,</p><p>فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</p><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe.</p><p>وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</p><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says,</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</p><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat. Then, Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) \"Say, O Muhammad, to those who deny you, oppose you and continue in their disbelief and obstinance.\"</p><p>كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ</p><p>(Each one is waiting,) among you and us;</p><p>فَتَرَبَّصُواْ</p><p>(so wait you too;) This is a command to await (anticipate).</p><p>فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَـبُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ</p><p>(and you shall know who are they that are on As-Sirat As-Sawi.) This means the straight road.</p><p>وَمَنِ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And who are they that have let themselves be guided. ) meaning guidance to the truth and the path of right guidance. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(And they will know, when they see the torment, who it is that is most astray from the path!) 25:42 And Allah said,</p><p>سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ</p><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is liar, the insolent one!) 54:26 This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, and all praise and gratitude is due to Allah. The Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya' will follow this, if Allah wills. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>",
    "<h2>Do not look at the Enjoyment of the Wealthy, be patient in the worship of Allah</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, \"Do not look at what these people of luxury and their likes and peers have of nice comforts. For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.\" Mujahid said,</p><p>أَزْوَجاً مِّنْهُمْ</p><p>(various groups of them,) \"This means the wealthy people.\" This means, \"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) better than that which We have given them.\" This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ ءاتَيْنَـكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْءَانَ الْعَظِيمَ لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p>(And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.) 15:87-88 Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى</p><p>(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) 93:5 For this reason, Allah says,</p><p>وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى</p><p>(But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. ) In the Sahih it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p>«مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟»</p><p>(What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah\" He said,</p><p>«بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْض»</p><p>(The blessings of the earth.) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.\" Qatadah said,</p><p>لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p>(that We may test them thereby.) \"So that We may put them to trial.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.) This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً</p><p>(O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell).) 66:6 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at `Umar bin Al-Khattab's. `Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray. However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say,</p><p>وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلوةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p>(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)\" Allah said;</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p>(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.) 65:2-3 Allah also says,</p><p>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) until,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.) 51:56-58 Thus, Allah says,</p><p>لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p>(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) Verily, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ تَفَرَّغْ لِعِبَادَتِي أَمْلَأْ صَدْرَكَ غِنىً وَأَسُدَّ فَقْرَكَ، وَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ، مَلَأْتُ صَدْرَكَ شُغْلًا وَلَمْ أَسُدَّ فَقْرَك»</p><p>(Allah, the Exalted, says, \"O son of Adam, perform My worship and I will fill your chest with wealth and fulfill your needs. If you do not do so, then I will fill your chest with toil and I will not fulfill your needs.\") It is also reported from Zayd bin Thabit that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا هَمَّهُ فَرَّقَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ، وَجَعَلَ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ، وَلَمْ يَأْتِهِ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَا كُتِبَ لَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَتِ الْآخِرَةُ نِيَّتَهُ، جَمَعَ لَهُ أَمْرَهُ وَجَعَلَ غِنَاهُ فِي قَلْبِهِ، وَأَتَتْهُ الدُّنْيَا وَهِيَ رَاغِمَة»</p><p>(Whoever makes the worldly life his major concern, then Allah will scatter his situation for him (i.e. make it difficult) and his poverty will be placed between his eyes. He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him (i.e. made easy) and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway (in spite of his not seeking it).) Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالْعَـقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p><p>(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement,</p><p>لَوْلاَ</p><p>(Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad ﷺ bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِى الصُّحُفِ الاٍّولَى</p><p>(Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former papers (Scriptures)) This means the Qur'an which Allah revealed to him while he was an unlettered man who could not write well and who did not study with the People of the Book. Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ءايَـتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الاٌّيَـتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ - أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ يُتْلَى عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَى لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord\" Say: \"The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.\" It is not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.) 29:50-51 In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا مِنْ نَبِيَ إِلَّا وَقَدْ أُوتِيَ مِنَ الْآياتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَىىِمثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(There was not any Prophet except that he was given signs that caused men to believe. That which I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, so I hope that I have the most followers among them (the Prophets) on the Day of Resurrection.) In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them. Then Allah says,</p><p>وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this, they would surely have said: \"Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger...\") This means, \"If We had destroyed these rejecting people before We sent this Noble Messenger to them and revealed the Mighty Book to them, they would have said,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger,) meaning, `before you destroyed us, so we could have believed in him and followed him.' This is like Allah said,</p><p>فَنَتَّبِعَ ءَايَـتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَى</p><p>(we should certainly have followed Your Ayat, before we were humiliated and disgraced.) Allah, the Exalted, explains that these rejecters are stubborn and obstinate and they will not believe.</p><p>وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ ءايَةٍ حَتَّى يَرَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ الاٌّلِيمَ</p><p>(Even if every sign should come them, until they see the painful torment.) 10:97 This is as Allah says,</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa (of Allah), that you may receive mercy.) Until His statement,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ</p><p>(because of their turning away.) 6:155-157 Allah also says,</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَى مِنْ إِحْدَى الاٍّمَمِ</p><p>(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42</p><p>وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَـنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if there came to them a sign, they would surely believe therein.) 6:109 to the completion of those Ayat. Then, Allah says,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) \"Say, O Muhammad, to those who deny you, oppose you and continue in their disbelief and obstinance.\"</p><p>كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ</p><p>(Each one is waiting,) among you and us;</p><p>فَتَرَبَّصُواْ</p><p>(so wait you too;) This is a command to await (anticipate).</p><p>فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَـبُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ</p><p>(and you shall know who are they that are on As-Sirat As-Sawi.) This means the straight road.</p><p>وَمَنِ اهْتَدَى</p><p>(And who are they that have let themselves be guided. ) meaning guidance to the truth and the path of right guidance. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ الْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً</p><p>(And they will know, when they see the torment, who it is that is most astray from the path!) 25:42 And Allah said,</p><p>سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ الْكَذَّابُ الاٌّشِرُ</p><p>(Tomorrow they will come to know who is liar, the insolent one!) 54:26 This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, and all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.
