    "<h2>The Qur'an and the Proofs of its Truth Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators who disbelieve in the Qur'an'--</p><p>أَرَءَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ</p><p>(Tell me, if it) -- this Qur'an --</p><p>مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ كَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ</p><p>(is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it) means, `what do you think your position is before the One Who revealed it to His Messenger' Allah says:</p><p>مَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ هُوَ فِى شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(Who is more astray than one who is in opposition far away.) means, he is in a state of disbelief, stubbornness and opposition to the truth, and is following a path that leads far away from guidance.

But it will undoubtedly come to pass. Then Allah states that He is Able to do all things and He encompasses all things, and it is very easy for Him to bring about the Hour:</p><p>أَلاَ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُّحِيطُ</p><p>(Verily, He is surrounding all things!) means, all of creation is subject to His control, dominion and knowledge; He is controlling all things by His power, so whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen, and there is no god worthy of worship apart from Him. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Fussilat. To Allah be praise and blessings.</p>",

The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said, \"Why should we strive if it is something that is already cut and dried\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«سَدِّدُوا وَقَارِبُوا فَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ الْجَنَّةِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَلٍ،وَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ النَّارِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَل»</p><p>(Strive with your deeds as hard as you can for middle course or close to it, for the person who is destined for Paradise will die doing the deeds of the people of Paradise, regardless of what he did before, and the person who is destined for Hell will die doing the deeds of the people of Hell, regardless of what he did before.)

    "<h2>The Provision of Allah in this World and the Hereafter</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of His kindness towards His creation, in that He provides for every last one of them and does not forget anyone. When it comes to His provision, the righteous and the sinner are alike. Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي الاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِى كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And no moving creature is there on the earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.) (11:6) And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(He gives provisions to whom He wills.) means, He gives generously to whomsoever He wills.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْقَوِىُّ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Strong, the Almighty.) means, there is nothing that can overpower Him. Then Allah says:</p><p>مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ الاٌّخِرَةِ</p><p>(Whosoever desires the reward of the Hereafter,) means, whoever does things for the sake of the Hereafter,</p><p>نَزِدْ لَهُ فِى حَرْثِهِ</p><p>(We give him increase in his reward, ) meaning, `We will give him strength and help him to do what he wants to do, and We will increase it for him. So for every good, We will multiply it and give him between ten and seven hundred good rewards,' as much as Allah wills.</p><p>وَمَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ الدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَا لَهُ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ مِن نَّصِيبٍ</p><p>(and whosoever desires the reward of this world, We give him thereof, and he has no portion in the Hereafter.) means, whoever strives for the purpose of worldly gains, and never pays any heed to the Hereafter at all, Allah will deny him the Hereafter; and in this world, if He wills He will give to him and if He does not will, he will gain neither. So the one who strives with this intention in mind will have the worst deal in this world and in the Hereafter. The evidence for that is the fact that this Ayah is reinforced by the passage in Subhan (i.e., Surat Al-Isra') in which Allah says: y</p><p>مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَـجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَـهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا - وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَـئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا - كُلاًّ نُّمِدُّ هَـؤُلاءِ وَهَـؤُلاءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُورًا - انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَـتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلاً</p><p>(Whoever desires the quick-passing, We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will (enter) burn therein disgraced and rejected. And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it while he is a believer -- then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated. On each -- these as well as those -- We bestow from the bounties of your Lord. And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden. See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.) (17:18-21) It was reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«بَشِّرْ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةَ بِالسَّنَاءِ وَالرِّفْعَةِ وَالنَّصْرِ وَالتَّمْكِينِ فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَمَنْ عَمِلَ مِنْهُمْ عَمَلَ الْاخِرَةِ لِلدُّنْيَا، لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ فِي الْاخِرَةِ مِنْ نَصِيب»</p><p>(Give the glad tidings to this Ummah of sublimity, high status, victory and power in the land. But whoever among them does the deeds of the Hereafter for the sake of worldly gain, will have no portion of the Hereafter.)\"</p><h2>Making Legislation for the Creatures is Shirk Allah says:</h2><p>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُواْ لَهُمْ مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Or have they partners with Allah who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained) means, they do not follow what Allah has ordained for you of upright religion; on the contrary, they follow what their devils (Shayatin), of men and Jinn, have prescribed for them. They instituted taboos, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah or Ham. They also permitted eating flesh and blood of animals not slaughtered for consumption, gambling and other kinds of misguidance, ignorance and falsehood. These are things that they invented during Jahiliyyah, when they came up with all kinds of false rulings on what was permitted and what was forbidden, and false rites of worship and other corrupt ideas. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ عَمْرَو بْنَ لُحَيِّ بْنِ قَمَعَةَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(I saw `Amr bin Luhayy bin Qama`ah dragging his intestines in Hell) -- because he had been the first one to introduce the idea of the Sa'ibah. This man was one of the kings of the Khuza`ah tribe, and he was the first one to do these things. He was the one who had made the Quraysh worship idols, may the curse of Allah be upon him. Allah said:</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةُ الْفَصْلِ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ</p><p>(And had it not been for a decisive Word, the matter would have been judged between them.) means, the punishment would have been hastened for them, were it not for the fact that it had already been decreed that it would be delayed until the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>وَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, for the wrongdoers there is a painful torment.) i.e., an agonizing torment in Hell, what a terrible destination.</p><h2>The Terror of the Idolators in the Place of Gathering</h2><p>تَرَى الظَّـلِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا كَسَبُواْ</p><p>(You will see the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned,) means, in the arena of Resurrection.</p><p>وَهُوَ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ</p><p>(and it will surely befall them.) means, the thing that they fear will undoubtedly happen to them. This is how they will be on the Day of Resurrection; they will be in a state of utter fear and terror.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ فِى رَوْضَـتِ الْجَنَّـتِ لَهُمْ مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(But those who believe and do righteous deeds (will be) in the flowering meadows of the Gardens. They shall have whatsoever they desire with their Lord.) What comparison can there be between the former and the latter How can the one who will be in the arena of resurrection in a state of humiliation and fear, deserving it for his wrongdoing, be compared with the one who will be in the gardens of Paradise, enjoying whatever he wants of food, drink, clothing, dwellings, scenery, spouses and other delights such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has never crossed the minds of men. Allah says:</p><p>ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</p><p>(That is the supreme grace.) means, the ultimate victory and complete blessing.</p>",

So the one who strives with this intention in mind will have the worst deal in this world and in the Hereafter. The evidence for that is the fact that this Ayah is reinforced by the passage in Subhan (i.e., Surat Al-Isra') in which Allah says: y</p><p>مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَـجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَـهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا - وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَـئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا - كُلاًّ نُّمِدُّ هَـؤُلاءِ وَهَـؤُلاءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُورًا - انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَـتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلاً</p><p>(Whoever desires the quick-passing, We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.

They instituted taboos, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah or Ham. They also permitted eating flesh and blood of animals not slaughtered for consumption, gambling and other kinds of misguidance, ignorance and falsehood. These are things that they invented during Jahiliyyah, when they came up with all kinds of false rulings on what was permitted and what was forbidden, and false rites of worship and other corrupt ideas. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«رَأَيْتُ عَمْرَو بْنَ لُحَيِّ بْنِ قَمَعَةَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(I saw `Amr bin Luhayy bin Qama`ah dragging his intestines in Hell) -- because he had been the first one to introduce the idea of the Sa'ibah. This man was one of the kings of the Khuza`ah tribe, and he was the first one to do these things. He was the one who had made the Quraysh worship idols, may the curse of Allah be upon him. Allah said:</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةُ الْفَصْلِ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ</p><p>(And had it not been for a decisive Word, the matter would have been judged between them.) means, the punishment would have been hastened for them, were it not for the fact that it had already been decreed that it would be delayed until the Day of Resurrection.</p><p>وَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, for the wrongdoers there is a painful torment.) i.e., an agonizing torment in Hell, what a terrible destination.</p><h2>The Terror of the Idolators in the Place of Gathering</h2><p>تَرَى الظَّـلِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا كَسَبُواْ</p><p>(You will see the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned,) means, in the arena of Resurrection.</p><p>وَهُوَ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ</p><p>(and it will surely befall them.) means, the thing that they fear will undoubtedly happen to them. This is how they will be on the Day of Resurrection; they will be in a state of utter fear and terror.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ فِى رَوْضَـتِ الْجَنَّـتِ لَهُمْ مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(But those who believe and do righteous deeds (will be) in the flowering meadows of the Gardens.

Allah says:</p><p>ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</p><p>(That is the supreme grace.) means, the ultimate victory and complete blessing.</p>",
    "<h2>The Provision of Allah in this World and the Hereafter</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of His kindness towards His creation, in that He provides for every last one of them and does not forget anyone.

Then Allah says:</p><p>مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ الاٌّخِرَةِ</p><p>(Whosoever desires the reward of the Hereafter,) means, whoever does things for the sake of the Hereafter,</p><p>نَزِدْ لَهُ فِى حَرْثِهِ</p><p>(We give him increase in his reward, ) meaning, `We will give him strength and help him to do what he wants to do, and We will increase it for him.

All I ask of you is that you withhold your evil from me and let me convey the Messages of my Lord. If you will not help me, then do not disturb me, for the sake of the ties of kinship that exist between you and I.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about the Ayah:</p><p>إِلاَّ الْمَوَدَّةَ فِى الْقُرْبَى</p><p>(except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.)

And Allah said:</p><p>وَيُحِقُّ الْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَـتِهِ</p><p>(and establishes the truth by His Word.) means, He establishes it and strengthens it and makes it clear by His Words, i.e., by His evidence and signs.</p><p>إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p>(Verily, He knows well what are in the breasts.) means, all that is hidden in the hearts of men.</p>",
    "<h2>Good News of the Blessings of Paradise for the People of Faith</h2><p>Having mentioned the gardens of Paradise, Allah then says to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds:</p><p>ذَلِكَ الَّذِى يُبَشِّرُ اللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</p><p>(That is whereof Allah gives glad tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous good deeds.) meaning, this will undoubtedly come to them, because it is glad tidings from Allah to them.</p><p>قُل لاَّ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِلاَّ الْمَوَدَّةَ فِى الْقُرْبَى</p><p>(Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.\") means, `say, O Muhammad, to these idolators among the disbeliever of Quraysh: I do not ask you for anything in return for this message and sincere advice which I bring to you. All I ask of you is that you withhold your evil from me and let me convey the Messages of my Lord. If you will not help me, then do not disturb me, for the sake of the ties of kinship that exist between you and I.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about the Ayah:</p><p>إِلاَّ الْمَوَدَّةَ فِى الْقُرْبَى</p><p>(except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.) Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"To be kind to the family of Muhammad ﷺ&nbsp;.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"No, you have jumped to a hasty conclusion. There was no clan among Quraysh to whom the Prophet did not have some ties of kinship.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Except that you uphold the ties of kinship that exist between me and you.\" This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad with a different chain of narration.</p><p>وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَّزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْناً</p><p>(And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof) means, `whoever does a good deed, We will increase him in good for it, i.e., in reward.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً</p><p>(Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) (4:40)</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate.) means, He forgives many bad deeds and increases a small amount of good deeds; He conceals and forgives sins and He multiplies and increases the reward of good deeds.</p><h2>The Accusation that the Prophet fabricated the Qur'an -- and the Response to that</h2><p>Allah's saying;</p><p>أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً فَإِن يَشَإِ اللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ</p><p>(Or say they: \"He has invented a lie against Allah\" If Allah willed, He could have sealed up your heart.) means, `if you had invented any lies against Him, as these ignorant people claim,'</p><p>يَخْتِمْ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ</p><p>(He could have sealed up your heart.) means, `and thus caused you to forget what had already come to you of the Qur'an.'

    "<h2>Allah accepts Repentance and responds to Supplications</h2><p>Here Allah reminds His servants that He accepts repentance.

    "<h2>Allah accepts Repentance and responds to Supplications</h2><p>Here Allah reminds His servants that He accepts repentance. If they turn to Him and come back to Him, then by His kindness and generosity He forgives, overlooks and conceals (their sins), as He says:</p><p>وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ يَجِدِ اللَّهَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً</p><p>(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (4:110) It was reported in Sahih Muslim that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«للهُ تَعَالَى أَشَدُّ فَرَحًا بِتَوْبَةِ عَبْدِهِ حِينَ يَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ أَحَدِكُمْ كَانَتْ رَاحِلَتُهُ بِأَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ، فَانْفَلَتَتْ مِنْهُ، وَعَلَيْهَا طَعَامُهُ وَشَرَابُهُ، فَأَيِسَ مِنْهَا فَأَتَى شَجَرَةً فَاضْطَجَعَ فِي ظِلِّهَا، قَدْ أَيِسَ مِنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ، فَبَيْنَمَا هُوَ كَذَلِكَ إِذَا هُوَ بِهَا، قَائِمَةً عِنْدَهُ، فَأَخَذَ بِخِطَامِهَا، ثُمَّ قَالَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ: اللْهُمَّ أَنْتَ عَبْدِي وَأَنَا رَبُّكَ، أَخْطَأَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَح»</p><p>(Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than anyone of you who loses his riding beast in a barren land, and it was carrying his food and drink; he despairs of ever finding it, so he comes to a tree and lies down in its shade, having given up all hope of finding his riding beast; then whilst he is there like that, suddenly he sees it standing near him, so he takes hold of its reins and because of his great joy he says, \"O Allah,You are my slave and I am Your Lord!\" -- i.e,. he makes a mistake because of his great joy. )\" A similar report was also narrated in the Sahih from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants,) It was reported that Az-Zuhri said, concerning this Ayah, that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; said:</p><p>«للهُ أَشَدُّ فَرَحًا بِتَوْبَةِ عَبْدِهِ مِنْ أَحَدِكُمْ يَجِدُ ضَالَّتَهُ فِي الْمَكَانِ الَّذِي يَخَافُ أَنْ يَقْتُلَهُ فِيهِ الْعَطَش»</p><p>(Allah rejoices more over the repentance of His servant than one of you feels when he finds his lost camel in a place where he had feared that he would die of thirst.)\" Hammam bin Al-Harith said, \"Ibn Mas`ud was asked about a man who commits immoral sins with a woman and then marries her.

    "<h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion.

He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.

Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns.

He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.)

When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p>",

    "<h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion.

He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.

    "<h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion.

He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p>",

Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ </div><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ </div><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ </div><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ </div><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</div><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ </div><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</div><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p>",

Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives.

    "<h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.)

    "<h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.)

But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms.

Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)

    "<h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.)

    "<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him.

Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p>",

(21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw.

The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path.

And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.)

Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p>",
    "<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him!

He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay!

The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.

    "<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

(Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!

They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay!

The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.)

But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant.

The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.

    "<h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument.

Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path.

And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.)

And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p>",

Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",
    "<p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</p><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><p>قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</p><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p>وَأَنَّهُ</p><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><p>فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p>لَدَيْنَآ</p><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p>لَّعَلِّى</p><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p>حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><p>كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p>أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</p><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p>وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><p>وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p>فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</p><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</p><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p>وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</p><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><p>سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</p><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><p>وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</p><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p><h2>The Idolators' admission that Allah is the Sole Creator, and Further Evidence of that</h2><p>Allah says: `If you, O Muhammad, were to ask these idolators who associate others with Allah and worship others besides Him,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ الْعَزِيزُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(\"Who has created the heavens and the earth\" They will surely say: \"The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.\") In other words, they will admit that the Creator of all that is Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, yet they still worship others -- idols and false gods -- alongside Him.</p><p>الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الاٌّرْضَ مَهْداً</p><p>(Who has made for you the earth like a bed,) means, smooth, stable and firm, so that you can travel about in it, and stand on it and sleep and walk about, even though it is created above water, but He has strengthened it with the mountains, lest it should shake.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً</p><p>(and has made for you roads therein,) means, paths between the mountains and the valleys.</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(in order that you may find your way.) means, in your journeys from city to city, region to region, land to land.</p><p>وَالَّذِى نَزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ</p><p>(And Who sends down water from the sky in due measure, ) means, according to what is sufficient for your crops, fruits and drinking water for yourselves and your cattle.</p><p>فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً</p><p>(then We revive a dead land therewith,) means, a barren land, for when the water comes to it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). By referring to the revival of the earth, Allah draws attention to how He will bring bodies back to life on the Day of Resurrection, after they have been dead.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ</p><p>(and even so you will be brought forth.) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَالَّذِى خَلَقَ الأَزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا</p><p>(And Who has created all the pairs) meaning, of everything that grows in the earth, all kinds of plants, crops, fruits, flowers, etc., and all different kinds of animals.</p><p>وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الْفُلْكِ</p><p>(and has appointed for you ships) or vessels,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ</p><p>(and cattle on which you ride.) means, He has subjugated them to you and made it easy for you to eat their meat, drink their milk and ride on their backs. Allah says:</p><p>لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(In order that you may mount on their backs, ) meaning, sit comfortably and securely,</p><p>عَلَى ظُهُورِهِ</p><p>(on their backs) means, on the backs of these kinds of animals.</p><p>ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ</p><p>(and then may remember the favor of your Lord) means, whereby these animals are subjugated to you.</p><p>إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ</p><p>(when you mount thereon, and say: \"Glory to Him Who has subjected this to us, and we could have never had it.\") means, if it were not for the fact that Allah has subjugated these things to us, we could never have done this by our own strength.' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said: \"We could not have done this ourselves.\"</p><p>وَإِنَّآ إِلَى رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p>(And verily, to Our Lord we indeed are to return.) means, `We will return to Him after our death, and our ultimate destination is with Him.' In this Ayah, mention of earthly journeys draws attention to the journey of the Hereafter, just as elsewhere, mention of earthly provision draws attention to the importance of ensuring provision for the Hereafter, as Allah says:</p><p>وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ التَّقْوَى</p><p>(And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the Taqwa) (2:197). And mention of earthly garments is also used to draw attention to the raiment of the Hereafter:</p><p>وَرِيشًا وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَى ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ</p><p>(and as an adornment; and the raiment of the Taqwa, that is better) (7:26).</p><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators' attribution of Offspring to Allah</h2><p>Here Allah speaks of the lies and fabrications of the idolators, when they devoted some of their cattle to their false gods and some to Allah, as He described in Surat Al-An`am where He said:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ الْحَرْثِ وَالاٌّنْعَامِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَى شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p>(And they assign to Allah share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah\" according to their claim, \"and this is for our partners.\" But the share of their partners reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their partners! Evil is the way they judge!) (6:136). Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:</p><p>أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الاٍّنثَى - تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَى</p><p>(Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!) (53:21-22) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ الإنسَـنَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Yet, they assign to some of His servants a share with Him. Verily, man is indeed a manifest ingrate!) Then He says:</p><p>أَمِ اتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَـكُم بِالْبَنِينَ</p><p>(Or has He taken daughters out of what He has created, and He has selected for you sons) This is a denunciation of them in the strongest terms, as He goes on to say:</p><p>وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ</p><p>(And if one of them is informed of the news of that which he sets forth as a parable to the Most Gracious, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with grief!) means, if one of these people is given the news that there has been born to him one of those which he attributes to Allah, i.e., a daughter, he hates this news and it depresses and overwhelms him so much that he keeps away from people because he feels so ashamed. Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah</p><p>أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِى الْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِى الْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ</p><p>(A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah</p><p>وَجَعَلُواْ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ الَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَـنِ إِنَـثاً</p><p>(And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:</p><p>أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ</p><p>(Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females</p><p>سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَـدَتُهُمْ</p><p>(Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,</p><p>وَيُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection. This is a stern warning and a serious threat.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ الرَّحْمَـنُ مَا عَبَدْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(And they said: \"If it had been the will of the Most Gracious, we should not have worshipped them.\") means, (they said:) `if Allah had willed, He would have prevented us from worshipping these idols which are images of the angels who are the daughters of Allah; He knows about this and He approves of it.' By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him. Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى اللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضَّلَـلَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\" Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied.) (16:36)</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") (43:45) And Allah says in this Ayah, after mentioning this argument of theirs:</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that.) meaning, of the truth of what they say and the arguments they put forward.</p><p>وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They do nothing but lie!) means, they tell lies and fabricate untruths.</p><p>مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ</p><p>(They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do nothing but lie!) Mujahid said, \"They do not appreciate the power of Allah.\"</p><h2>The Idolators have no Proof</h2><p>Allah condemns the idolators for worshipping others instead of Allah with no evidence or proof for doing so.</p><p>أَمْ ءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ كِتَـباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ</p><p>(Or have We given them any Book before this) means, before their idolatry.</p><p>فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ</p><p>(to which they are holding fast) means, with regard to what they are doing. This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَـناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen. Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(Nay! They say: \"we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.\") meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p>(And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;</p><p>وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم</p><p>(and we by their footsteps) means, behind them</p><p>مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers. Their hearts and their words are similar.</p><p>كَذَلِكَ مَآ أَتَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ قَالُواْ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ - أَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ طَـغُونَ</p><p>(Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: \"A sorcerer or a madman!\" Have they transmitted this saying to these Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!) (51:52-53) And Allah says here:</p><p>وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ</p><p>(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\") Then He says:</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad, to these idolators --'</p><p>أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَى مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ ءَابَآءَكُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(\"Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following\" They said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\") `Even if they were convinced of the truth of what you have brought to them, they will not follow it, because of their evil intentions and their arrogance towards the truth and its people.'</p><p>فَانتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ</p><p>(So We took revenge on them) means, on the disbelieving nations, by inflicting various kinds of punishments, as Allah has described in the stories of those nations.</p><p>فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(then see what was the end of those who denied) means, see what became of them, how they were destroyed and how Allah saved the believers.</p><h2>Ibrahim's Declaration of Tawhid Here</h2><p>Allah tells us about His servant, Messenger and close Friend, the leader of the monotheists and the father of all subsequent Prophets, from whom Quraysh were descended and claimed to have taken their religion. He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ لاًّبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِى بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ - إِلاَّ الَّذِى فَطَرَنِى فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(\"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.\" And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p>(that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَـقِيَةً فِى عَقِبِهِ</p><p>(And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) \"This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.\" A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, \"The word of Islam,\" which refers to the same thing suggested by the group.</p><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـؤُلاَءِ</p><p>(Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,</p><p>وَءَابَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.</p><p>حَتَّى جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.</p><p>وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ الْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.\") means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ</p><p>(And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,</p><p>لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:</p><p>نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)</p><p>لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً</p><p>(so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.</p><p>وَرَحْمَةُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p>(But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess.</p><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2><p>وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً</p><p>(And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.</p><p>لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِالرَّحْمَـنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ</p><p>(We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.</p><p>عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ</p><p>(whereby they ascend,) means, go up. And their houses would have doors, i.e., locks on their doors,</p><p>وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ</p><p>(and thrones on which they could recline,) means, all of that would be made of silver.</p><p>وَزُخْرُفاً</p><p>(And adornments) means, and gold. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.</p><p>وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:</p><p>«لَوْ أَنَّ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاء»</p><p>(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.</p><p>وَالاٌّخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger ﷺ of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, \"O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. \" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reclining, but he sat up and said:</p><p>«أَوَ فِي شَكَ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟»</p><p>(Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:</p><p>«أُولئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَـيِّـبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا»</p><p>(Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:</p><p>«أَمَا تَرْضَى أَنْ تَــكُونَ لَهُمُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَا تَشْرَبُوا فِي آنِيَةِ الذَّهَبِ وَالْفِضَّةِ، وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا فِي صِحَافِهَا، فَإِنَّهَا لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَلَنَا فِي الْاخِرَة»</p><p>(Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«لَوْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا تَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ مَا سَقَى مِنْهَا كَافِرًا شَرْبَةَ مَاءٍ أَبَدًا»</p><p>n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)\" At-Tirmidhi said: \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><h2>The Shaytan is the Companion of the One Who turns away from Ar-Rahman</h2><p>وَمَن يَعْشُ</p><p>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly)) means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p><p>عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ</p><p>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,) Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p><p>نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ</p><p>(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.) This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى</p><p>(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him) (4:115),</p><p>فَلَمَّا زَاغُواْ أَزَاغَ اللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ</p><p>(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away) (61:5), and</p><p>وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them) (41:25). Allah says here:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَنَا</p><p>(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,) meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p><p>قَالَ يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p>(he says, \"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts -- a worst companion (indeed)!\") Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا) (Till, when they both come to Us.) referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies. Then Allah says:</p><p>وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِى الْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ</p><p>(It will profit you not this Day as you did wrong, (and) that you will be sharers in the punishment.) means, `your being together in the Fire will not help you in the slightest, and you will both partake of the painful punishment.' Allah says:</p><p>أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ الصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِى الْعُمْىَ وَمَن كَانَ فِى ضَلَـلٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>Can you make the deaf to hear, or can you guide the blind or him who is in manifest error؟ means, `that is not up to you. All you have to do is convey the Message, but you do not have to guide them. Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He is Wise and Just in doing so.'</p><h2>Allah's Vengeance upon the Enemies of His Messenger will surely come to pass</h2><p>Allah further says:</p><p>فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(And even if We take you away, We shall indeed take vengeance on them.) means, `We will inevitably wreak vengeance upon them and punish them, even if you pass away.'</p><p>أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ الَّذِى وَعَدْنَـهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ</p><p>(Or (if) We show you that wherewith We threaten them, then verily, We have perfect command over them.) means, `We are able to do both,' but Allah will not take His Messenger (in death) until He gives him the joy of seeing his enemies brought low and gives him power and authority over them and their wealth. This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2><p>Allah then says;</p><p>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِى أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p>(So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you. Verily, you are on the straight path.) means, hold fast to the Qur'an which has been sent down to your heart, for it is truth and what it leads to is truth that shows the way to the straight path that leads to Gardens of Delight and eternal, everlasting goodness.</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is a Dhikr for you and your people,) It was said that this means, `it is an honor for you and your people;' this was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ</p><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you (O mankind) a Book in which there is Dhikrukum (your Reminder). Will you not then understand) (21:10)</p><p>وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ</p><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214)</p><p>وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(and you will be questioned.) means, `about this Qur'an, and how you acted upon it and what your response to it was.'</p><p>وَاسْئلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَـنِ ءَالِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p>(And ask whom We sent before you of Our Messengers: \"Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious\") means, `all the Messengers called their people to the same as that to which you are calling mankind, namely the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and they forbade the worship of idols and false gods.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.\") (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (وَاسْأَلِ الَّذِينَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ (مِنْ) رُسُلِنَا) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Musa was sent with the Message of Tawhid to Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2><p>Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Musa, peace be upon him, and how He sent him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.</p><p>وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ ءَايَةٍ إِلاَّ هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا</p><p>(And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,</p><p>يأَيُّهَ السَّاحِرُ</p><p>(\"O you sorcerer!...\") meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ ءَايَـتٍ مّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ - وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يَمُوسَى ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا الرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُم بَـلِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ</p><p>(So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: \"O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.\" But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)</p><h2>Fir`awn's Address to His People and how Allah punished Him</h2><p>Allah tells us how Fir`awn stubbornly persisted in his rebellion and disbelief. He assembled his people and addressed them in a vainglorious fashion, boasting of his dominion over Egypt.</p><p>أَلَيْسَ لِى مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـذِهِ الاٌّنْهَـرُ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِى</p><p>(Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me) Qatadah said, \"They had gardens and rivers of flowing water.\"</p><p>أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ</p><p>(See you not then) means, `do you not see my position of might and power' -- implying that Musa and his followers were poor and weak. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى</p><p>(Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression.) (79:23-25)</p><p>أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـذَا الَّذِى هُوَ مَهِينٌ</p><p>(Am I not better than this one who is despicable) As-Suddi said, \"He was saying, `indeed I am better than this one, who is despicable'.\" Some of the grammarians of Basrah said that Fir`awn -- may the curse of Allah be upon him -- was saying that he was better than Musa, peace be upon him. But this is an obvious lie, may continued curses be upon him until the Day of Resurrection. By describing Musa as despicable he meant -- as Sufyan said -- insignificant. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"He meant, weak.\" Ibn Jarir said, \"He meant, he had no power, authority or wealth.\"</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly) means, he cannot speak clearly, he stammers and cannot speak well. Fir`awn's description of Musa as \"despicable\" is a lie; rather it is he who was despicable and insignificant, lacking in physical, moral and religious terms, and it is Musa who was noble, truthful, righteous and upright.</p><p>وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ</p><p>(and can scarcely express himself clearly). This was also a lie. Although something happened to Musa's tongue when he was a child, when it was burnt by a coal. He asked Allah to loosen the knot from his tongue (i.e., to correct his speech defect) so that they could understand what he said, and Allah had answered his prayer and said:</p><p>قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</p><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa) (20:36). It may be the case that some problem remained which he had not asked to be relieved of, as Al-Hasan Al-Basri suggested, and that he had asked only to be relieved of that which stood in the way of his conveying the Message. A person cannot be blamed for physical matters over which he has no control. Even though Fir`awn had the intelligence to understand that, he wanted to confuse and mislead his people, who were ignorant and stupid. So he said:</p><p>فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِىَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ</p><p>(Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him...) meaning, adornments which are placed on the arms. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Qatadah and others.</p><p>أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ</p><p>(or angels sent along with him) meaning, to serve him and to testify that he is telling the truth. He looked only at outward appearances and did not understand the true inner matters that are clearer than what he focused on, if only he had understood that. Allah says:</p><p>فَاسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ</p><p>(Thus he fooled his people, and they obeyed him.) meaning, he confused them and invited them to misguidance, and they responded to him.</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were ever a people who were rebellious.) Then Allah says:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said it means: \"When they angered Us means, they provoked Our wrath.\" Ad-Dahhak said, it means \"They made Us angry.\" This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and other scholars of Tafsir. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Uqbah bin `Amir, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مَا يَشَاءُ، وَهُوَ مُقِيمٌ عَلى مَعَاصِيهِ، فَإِنَّمَا ذَلِكَ اسْتِدْرَاجٌ مِنْهُ لَه»</p><p>(When you see that Allah gives a person what he wants even though he is persisting in sin, that means that Allah is enticing him into destruction.) Then he recited:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all.) It was reported that Tariq bin Shihab said, \"I was with `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, and the issue of sudden death was mentioned. He said, `It is a relief for the believer and a source of regret for the disbeliever.' Then he recited the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all). \" `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I found that punishment comes with negligence, meaning the Ayah:</p><p>فَلَمَّآ ءَاسَفُونَا انتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَـهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</p><p>(So when they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all).\"</p><p>فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ</p><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) Abu Mijlaz said, \"Precedent for others who do the same as they did.\" He and Mujahid said, \"An example, i.e., a lesson to those who come after them.\" Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path, and unto Him is the final return.</p><h2>The Contempt of the Quraysh for the son of Maryam, and His true Status with Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how the Quraysh persisted in their disbelief and stubborn arguments:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) Several others narrated that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak said, \"They laughed, i.e., they were astounded by that.\" Qatadah said, \"They were repelled by that and they laughed.\" Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"They turned away.\" The reason for this was mentioned by Muhammad bin Ishaq in As-Sirah. He said, \"According to what I have heard, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat down one day with Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah in the Masjid, and An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came and sat down with them. There were also other men from the Quraysh in the gathering. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke, then An-Nadr bin Al-Harith came up to him and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke to him until he defeated him in argument. Then he recited to him and to them,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ got up and went to sit with `Abdullah bin Al-Zab`ari At-Tamimi. Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah said to him, `By Allah, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith could not match the son of `Abd Al-Muttalib in argument. Muhammad ﷺ claims that we and these gods that we worship are fuel for Hell.' `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, `By Allah, if I meet with him I will defeat him in argument. Ask Muhammad ﷺ whether everyone that is worshipped instead of Allah will be in Hell with those who worshipped him, for we worship the angels, and the Jews worship `Uzayr, and the Christians worship the Messiah `Isa bin Maryam.' Al-Walid and those who were sitting with him were amazed at what `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said, and they thought that he had come up with a good point. He said this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:</p><p>«كُلُّ مَنْ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْبَدَ مِنْ دُونِ اللهِ فَهُوَ مَعَ مَنْ عَبَدَهُ، فَإِنَّهُمْ إِنَّمَا يَعْبُدُونَ الشَّيْطَانَ وَمَنْ أَمَرَهُمْ بِعِبَادَتِه»</p><p>(Everyone who likes to worship something other than Allah will be with the one whom he worshipped, for indeed they are worshipping the Shaytan and whomever told them to worship that person.)\" Then Allah revealed the words:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا الْحُسْنَى أُوْلَـئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, those for whom the good has preceded from Us, they will be removed far therefrom (Hell)) (21:101), meaning that `Isa, `Uzayr and rabbis and monks who were also worshipped, who spent their lives in devotion towards Allah. The misguided people who came after them took them as lords instead of Allah. Concerning the notion of worshipping the angels as daughters of Allah, the following words were revealed:</p><p>وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son (or children).\" Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) (21:26) Concerning `Isa bin Maryam, the fact that he is worshipped instead of Allah, and to the amazement of Al-Walid and the others who were present at the argument, the following was revealed:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) meaning, they take this argument as a basis for rejecting your message. Then Allah mentions `Isa bin Maryam and says:</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ - وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(He was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth. And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for the Hour. ) meaning, the miracles and signs that happened at his hands, such as raising the dead and healing the sick, are sufficient as signs of the approach of the Hour.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَاتَّبِعُونِ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it. And follow Me! This is the straight path).\" Ibn Jarir mentioned that Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p>وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ</p><p>(And when the son of Maryam is quoted as an example, behold, your people cry aloud thereat.) \"This means the Quraysh, when it was said to them:</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it.) (21:98) The Quraysh said to him: `What about `Isa bin Maryam' He said:</p><p>«ذَاكَ عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُه»</p><p>(He is the servant and Messenger of Allah.) They said, `By Allah, he means that we should take him as a lord just as the Christians took `Isa son of Maryam as a lord.' Then Allah said:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\"</p><p>وَقَالُواْ ءَأَالِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ</p><p>(And say: \"Are our gods better or is he\"). Qatadah said, \"They were saying, `our gods are better than him'.\" Qatadah said; \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, recited it (أَآلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هذَا) (Are our gods better or is this (person))\" they mean Muhammad ﷺ.</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument.) means, for the sake of stubborn argument, for they knew that he (`Isa ) was not included in the Ayah (21:98), because that would not make sense. The words,</p><p>إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:98) are addressed to the Quraysh, for they used to worship idols and false gods -- they did not worship the Messiah so why should he be included in what the Ayah says What they said was only for the sake of argument; they did not really believe in it. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا ضَلَّ قَوْمٌ بَعْدَ هُدًى كَانُوا عَلَيْهِ، إِلَّا أُوْرِثُوا الْجَدَل»</p><p>g(No people go astray after having been guided, but they resort to (futile) argument.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah:</p><p>مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاَ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ</p><p>(They quoted not the above example except for argument. Nay! But they are a quarrelsome people).\" It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, we do not know it except from the Hadith of Hajjaj bin Dinar...\"</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He (`Isa) was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him,) means, `Isa, peace be upon him; he was no more than one of the servants of Allah whom Allah blessed with prophethood and messengership.</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) means, `a sign, proof and evidence of Our power to do whatever We will.'</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلَـئِكَةً فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ</p><p>(And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth.) As-Suddi said, \"They would have taken your place on (the earth). \" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Qatadah said, \"They would have succeeded one another just as you succeed one another.\" This view is implied by the former veiw. Mujahid said, \"They would have populated the earth instead of you.\" Allah's saying:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he (`Isa) shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) The correct view concerning this phrase is that it refers to his descent before the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p>(And there is none of the People of the Scripture but must believe in him before his death) (4:159). -- meaning before the death of `Isa, peace be upon him --</p><p>وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them )4:159(. This meaning has the support from an alternate recitation of the Aya0t؛ (وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلَمٌ لِلسَّاعَةِ) (And he shall be a known sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, evidence that the Hour will surely come. Mujahid said:</p><p>وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ</p><p>(And he shall be a sign for (the coming of) the Hour.) means, sign and \"One of the signs of the Hour will be the appearance of `Isa son of Maryam before the Day of Resurrection. \" Something similar was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Many Mutawatir Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that `Isa will descend before the Day of Resurrection as a just ruler and fair judge.</p><p>فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا</p><p>(Therefore have no doubt concerning it.) means, do not doubt that it will surely come to pass.</p><p>وَاتَّبِعُونِ</p><p>(And follow Me.) means, `in what I tell you about it.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌوَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ</p><p>(This is the straight path. And let not Shaytan hinder you.) means, from following the truth.</p><p>إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌوَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(Verily, he (Satan) to you is a plain enemy. And when `Isa came with (Our) clear proofs, he said: \"I have come to you with Al-Hikmah...\"), meaning prophethood:</p><p>وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِى تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ</p><p>(and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) in which you differ.) Ibn Jarir said, \"This means religious matters, not worldly matters.\" What he said is good.</p><p>فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(Therefore have Taqwa of Allah) means, `with regard to what I command you to do.'</p><p>وَأَطِيعُونِ</p><p>(and obey me.) means, `in what I bring to you.'</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(Verily, Allah! He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is the straight path.) means, `you and I are enslaved to Him, in need of Him and we commonly share in the worship of Him Alone, associating none with Him.'</p><p>هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ</p><p>(This is the straight path) means, `what I have brought to you is the straight path, which is the worship of the Lord, may He exalted, Alone.'</p><p>فَاخْتَلَفَ الاٌّحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ</p><p>(But the sects from among themselves differed. ) means, they differed and became parties and factions, some who stated that he (`Isa) was the servant and Messenger of Allah -- which is true - while others claimed that he was the son of Allah or that he himself was Allah -- glorified be Allah far above what they say. Allah says:</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(So woe to those who do wrong from the torment of a painful Day)!</p><h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><p>إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><p>الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><p>يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><p>ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><p>أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</p><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><p>تُحْبَرُونَ</p><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><p>يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</p><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><p>مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</p><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><p>وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</p><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><p>وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><p>خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><p>لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</p><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><p>مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</p><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Punishment of the Doomed</h2><p>The description of the state of the blessed is followed by a description of the state of the doomed.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُجْرِمِينَ فِى عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـلِدُونَ لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(Verily, the criminals will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. It will not be lightened for them,) meaning, not even for one moment.</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ</p><p>(and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein,) means, they will despair of any goodness.</p><p>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(We wronged them not, but they were the wrongdoers.) means, by their committing wrong actions after proof had been established against them and Messengers had been sent to them, but they rejected them and rebelled, so they are to be punished accordingly. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik...\") who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, \"Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting on the Minbar:</p><p>وَنَادَوْاْ يمَـلِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p>(And they will cry: \"O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us.\") meaning, `let Him destroy our souls and give us some respite from our predicament.' But it will be as Allah says:</p><p>لاَ يُقْضَى عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا</p><p>(Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).</p><p>وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الاٌّشْقَى - الَّذِى يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَى - ثُمَّ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَا</p><p>(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:</p><p>قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّـكِثُونَ</p><p>He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Allah says:</p><p>لَقَدْ جِئْنَـكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَـرِهُونَ</p><p>(but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:</p><p>أَمْ أَبْرَمُواْ أَمْراً فَإِنَّا مُبْرِمُونَ</p><p>(Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, \"They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.\" What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:</p><p>أَمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّا لاَ نَسْمَعُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَهُم</p><p>(Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.</p><p>بَلَى وَرُسُلُنَا لَدَيْهِمْ يَكْتُبُونَ</p><p>(Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'</p><p>قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبّ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاْرْضِ رَبّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ- فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ وَيَلْعَبُواْ حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ- وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآء إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاْرْضِ إِلَـهٌ وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ-</p><h2>Allah has no Offspring Allah says:</h2><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) -- `O Muhammad' --</p><p>إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ</p><p>(If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of the worshippers.) meaning, `if this were so, then I would worship Him on that basis, because I am one of His servants; I obey all that He commands me and I am not too arrogant or proud to worship Him.' This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:</p><p>لَّوْ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَى مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</p><p>(Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created. But glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (39:4). Allah says here:</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ رَبِّ الْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne! Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.</p><p>فَذَرْهُمْ يَخُوضُواْ</p><p>(So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,</p><p>وَيَلْعَبُواْ</p><p>(and play) in their world,</p><p>حَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى يُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day.</p><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى فِى السَّمآءِ إِلَـهٌ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ إِلَـهٌ</p><p>(It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.</p><p>وَهُوَ الْحَكِيمُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.) This Ayah is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَهُوَ اللَّهُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَفِى الاٌّرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p>(And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) (6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.</p><p>وَتَبَارَكَ الَّذِى لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p>(And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.</p><p>وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ</p><p>(and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.</p><p>وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p>(and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished.</p><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2><p>وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ</p><p>(And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.</p><p>الشَّفَـعَةَ</p><p>(of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.</p><p>إِلاَّ مَن شَهِدَ بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave.</p><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\" How then are they turned away) means, `if you ask these idolators who associate others in worship with Allah,'</p><p>مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\") means, they will admit that He Alone is the Creator of all things and He has no partner in that. Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:</p><p>فَأَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</p><p>(How then are they turned away)</p><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") means, Muhammad ﷺ said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ يرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُواْ هَـذَا الْقُرْءاَنَ مَهْجُوراً</p><p>(And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.\") (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: \"`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (وَقَالَ الرَّسُولُ ياربِّ) (And the Messenger will say: \"O my Lord!\") Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p>وَقِيلِهِ يرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>(And his saying: \"O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!\") \"Allah is stating what Muhammad ﷺ said.\" Qatadah said, \"These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.\"</p><p>فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p>(So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.</p><p>وَقُلْ سَلَـمٌ</p><p>(and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'</p><p>فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.</p>",

    "<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, \"We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.\"' He said, \"We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: \"No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.\") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.\"' According to another report: \"A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.\"</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)\" He said, \"This means the day of Badr.\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.\" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)\" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)\"This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, \"It is Ad-Dukh,\" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said \"covering mankind.\"</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): \"Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!\") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\") (6:27)</p><p>وَأَنذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ</p><p>(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say: \"Our Lord!

(14:44) Allah says here:</p><p>أَنَّى لَهُمُ الذِّكْرَى وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ - ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ</p><p>(How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: \"(He is) one taught, a madman!\") meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ - وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.

Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَـهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.)

This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance. Ibn Jarir said, \"Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that \"the great Batshah\" is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection.\" This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, \"We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.\"' He said, \"We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: \"No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.\") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.\"' According to another report: \"A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.\"</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)\" He said, \"This means the day of Badr.\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.\" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)\" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)\"This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, \"It is Ad-Dukh,\" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said \"covering mankind.\"</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): \"Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!\") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)!

Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!\" (It will be said): \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).) (14:44) Allah says here:</p><p>أَنَّى لَهُمُ الذِّكْرَى وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ - ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ</p><p>(How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: \"(He is) one taught, a madman!\") meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ - وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.

Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَـهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.)

Verily, We will exact retribution.) Ibn Mas`ud interpreted this to mean the day of Badr. This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance. Ibn Jarir said, \"Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that \"the great Batshah\" is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection.\" This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, \"We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.\"' He said, \"We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: \"No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.\") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.\"' According to another report: \"A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.\"</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)\" He said, \"This means the day of Badr.\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.\" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)\" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)\"This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, \"It is Ad-Dukh,\" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said \"covering mankind.\"</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): \"Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!\") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire!

Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!\" (It will be said): \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).) (14:44) Allah says here:</p><p>أَنَّى لَهُمُ الذِّكْرَى وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ - ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ</p><p>(How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: \"(He is) one taught, a madman!\") meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ - وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.

(34:51-52)</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَـهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.)

Verily, We will exact retribution.) Ibn Mas`ud interpreted this to mean the day of Badr. This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance. Ibn Jarir said, \"Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that \"the great Batshah\" is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection.\" This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, \"We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.\"' He said, \"We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: \"No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.\") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.\"' According to another report: \"A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.\"</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)\" He said, \"This means the day of Badr.\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.\" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)\" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)\"This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, \"It is Ad-Dukh,\" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said \"covering mankind.\"</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): \"Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!\") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire!

This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire!

Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!\" (It will be said): \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).) (14:44) Allah says here:</p><p>أَنَّى لَهُمُ الذِّكْرَى وَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ - ثُمَّ تَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ مُعَلَّمٌ مَّجْنُونٌ</p><p>(How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: \"(He is) one taught, a madman!\") meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى</p><p>(On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ - وَقَالُواْ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانِ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.

Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَـهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِى طُغْيَـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</p><p>(And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.)

Verily, We will exact retribution.) Ibn Mas`ud interpreted this to mean the day of Badr. This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance. Ibn Jarir said, \"Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that \"the great Batshah\" is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection.\" This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.</p>",
    "<h2>Alarming the Idolators with News of the Day when the Sky will bring forth a visible Smoke</h2><p>Allah says, these idolaters are playing about in doubt, i.e., the certain truth has come to them, but they doubt it and do not believe in it. Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, \"We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,</p><p>يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.\"' He said, \"We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet</p><p>قُلْ مَآ أَسْـَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ الْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ</p><p>(Say: \"No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.\") (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.\"' According to another report: \"A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.\"</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ - يَغْشَى النَّاسَ هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:</p><p>إِنَّا كَاشِفُواْ الْعَذَابِ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ عَآئِدُونَ</p><p>(Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:</p><p>يَوْمَ نَبْطِشُ الْبَطْشَةَ الْكُبْرَى إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَ</p><p>(On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)\" He said, \"This means the day of Badr.\" Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.\" This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتْى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخُرُوجَ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجَ عِيْسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَثَلَاثَةَ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارًا تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنَ تَسُوقُ النَّاسَ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا، وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)\" This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Ibn Sayyad:</p><p>«إِنِّي خَبَأْتُ لَكَ خَبْأ»</p><p>(I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was concealing from him the words,</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)\"This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, \"It is Ad-Dukh,\" meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:</p><p>«اخْسَأْ فَلَنْ تَعْدُوَ قَدْرَك»</p><p>(Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:</p><p>فَارْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى السَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah</p><p>يَغْشَى النَّاسَ</p><p>(Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said \"covering mankind.\"</p><p>هَـذَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا - هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.</p><p>رَّبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مْؤْمِنُونَ</p><p>((They will say): \"Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!\") means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى النَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِـَايَـتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: \"Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!\") (6:27)</p><p>وَأَنذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَى أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ</p><p>(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say: \"Our Lord!

After Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, had stayed among them for a long time, and the proof of Allah had been established against them, and that only increased them in disbelief and stubbornness, he prayed to his Lord against them, a prayer which was answered.

After Musa, may Allah be pleased with him, had stayed among them for a long time, and the proof of Allah had been established against them, and that only increased them in disbelief and stubbornness, he prayed to his Lord against them, a prayer which was answered.

Verily, they are a host to be drowned.) When Musa and the Children of Israel has crossed the sea, Musa wanted to strike it with his staff so that it would go back as it had been, and it would form a barrier between then and Fir`awn and prevent him from reaching them. But Allah commanded him to leave it as it was, quiet and divided, and gave him the glad tidings that they were a host to be drowned, and that he should not fear either being overtaken by Fir`awn or drowning in the sea. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاتْرُكِ الْبَحْرَ رَهْواً</div><p>(And leave the sea as it is (quiet and divided).) means, leave it as it is and keep moving. Mujahid said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَهْواً</div><p>(as it is) means, a dry path, as it is. `Do not command it to go back; leave it until the last of them have entered it.' This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, Simak bin Harb and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمْ تَرَكُواْ مِن جَنَّـتٍ وَعُيُونٍ وَزُرُوعٍ</div><p>(How many of gardens and springs that they left behind.

Then all of that was taken away in a single morning, they departed from this world and went to Hell, what a terrible abode!</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَـهَا قَوْماً ءَاخَرِينَ </div><p>(Thus (it was)!

So they did not deserve to be given a respite, because of their disbelief, sin, transgression and stubbornness. Ibn Jarir recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"A man came to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and said to him: `O Abu Al-`Abbas, Allah says,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّمَآءُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُنظَرِينَ </div><p>(And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given respite) -- do the heavens and the earth weep for anybody' He, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `Yes, there is no one who does not have a gate in the heavens through which his provision comes down and his good deeds ascend. When the believer dies, that gate is closed; it misses him and weeps for him, and the place of prayer on earth where he used to pray and remember Allah also weeps for him. But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them.\"' Al-`Awfi reported something similar from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ نَجَّيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْمُهِينِ - مِن فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَالِياً مِّنَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ </div><p>(And indeed We saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment from Fir`awn; verily, he was arrogant and was of the excessive. ) Here Allah reminds them of how He saved them from their humiliation and subjugation at the hands of Fir`awn, when they were forced to do menial tasks.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَالِياً</div><p>(From Fir`awn; verily, he was arrogant) means, he was proud and stubborn.

    "<h2>Refutation of Those Who deny the Resurrection</h2><p>Here Allah denounces the idolators for their denial of the Resurrection and their belief that there is nothing after this life and no life or resurrection after death, which they based on the fact that their forefathers had died and had not returned.

He will make the evildoers fuel for the fire of Hell, and on that Day you will be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger will be a witness over you. Then Allah threatens them and warns them of the irresistible torment other idolators like who denied the resurrection, suffered. Such as the people of Tubba`, i.e., Saba'. Allah destroyed them, wreaked havoc upon their land and scattered them here and there throughout the land, as we have already seen in Surah Saba'. This was brought about because the idolators denied the Resurrection. Here too, the idolaters are compared to them. They Tubba` were Arab descendants of Qahtan, just as these people (Quraysh) were Arab descendants of `Adnan. Among the people of Himyar -- who are also known as Saba' -- when a man became their king, they called him Tubba`, just as the title Chosroes was given to the king of Persia, Caesar to the king of the Romans, Fir`awn to the disbelieving ruler of Egypt, Negus to the king of Ethiopia, and so on among other nations. But it so happened that one of the Tubba` left Yemen and went on a journey of conquest until he reached Samarqand, expanding his kingdom and domain. He is the one who founded Al-Hirah. It is agreed that he passed through Al-Madinah during the days of Jahiliyyah. He fought its inhabitants but they resisted him; they fought him by day and supplied him with food by night, so he felt ashamed before them and refrained from harming them. He was accompanied by two Jewish rabbis who advised him and told him that he would never prevail over this city, for it would be the place to which a Prophet would migrate towards the end of time. So he retreated and took them (the two rabbis) with him to Yemen. When he passed by Makkah, he wanted to destroy the Ka`bah, but they told him not to do that either. They told him about the significance of this House, that it had been built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, and that it would become of great importance through that Prophet who would be sent towards the end of time. So he respected it, performed Tawaf around it, and covered it with a fine cloth. Then he returned to Yemen and invited its people to follow the religion of guidance along with him. At that time, the religion of Musa, peace be upon him, was the religion followed by those who were guided, before the coming of the Messiah, peace be upon him. So the people of Yemen accepted the religion of guidance along with him. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا أَدْرِي تُبَّعٌ نَبِيًّا كَانَ، أَمْ غَيْرَ نَبِي»</p><p>(I do not know whether Tubba` was a Prophet or not.)

So it all comes from Him without rivals to dispute His authority; surely, this fact is completely certain.\" Allah said.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.)</p><h2>The Command to be Patient with the Harm of Idolators</h2><p>Allah's saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُل لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ يَغْفِرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Say to the believers to forgive those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) means, let the believers forgive the disbelievers and endure the harm that they direct against them. In the beginning of Islam, Muslims were ordered to observe patience in the face of the oppression of the idolators and the People of the Scriptures so that their hearts may incline towards Islam. However, when the disbelievers persisted in stubbornness, Allah legislated for the believers to fight in Jihad. Statements of this meaning were collected from `Abdullah bin `Abbas and Qatadah. Mujahid said about Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَرْجُونَ أَيَّامَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) \"They do not appreciate Allah's favors.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيَجْزِىَ قَوْماً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ</div><p>(that He may recompense people, according to what they have earned.) meaning, if the believers forgive the disbelievers in this life, Allah will still punish the disbelievers for their evil in the Hereafter. Allah's statement next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ </div><p>(Whosoever does a good deed, it is for himself, and whosoever does evil, it is against (himself). Then to your Lord you will be made to return.) meaning, you will all return to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, when you and your actions will be displayed before Him. Then, He will recompense you for your deeds, good for good and evil for evil.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ - وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ الْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِى بِيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ - ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ </div>",

In the Sahih, it is reported that Allah the Exalted will ask some of His servants on the Day of Resurrection,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَمْ أُزَوِّجْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ وَالْإِبِلَ، وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بَلَى يَارَبِّ. فَيَقُولُ: أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلَاقِيَّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا. فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: فَالْيَوْمَ أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي»</div><p>(\"Have I not given you a spouse, honored you and subjected the camels and horses to you Have I not allowed you to be a chief and a master\" The servant will say in answer, \"Yes, O Lord!\" Allah will say, \"Did you think that you would ever meet Me\" He will say, \"No.\" Allah the Exalted will say, \"then this Day, I will forget you as you forgot Me.\") Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُم بِأَنَّكُمُ اتَّخَذْتُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُواً</div><p>(This, because you took the revelations of Allah in mockery.) `We gave you this punishment as retribution because you mocked Allah's proofs that He sent to you, and made them the subject of jokes and jest,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَغَرَّتْكُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(and the life of the world deceived you.) `this life fooled you and you were seduced by to it, thus becoming among the ultimate losers,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يُخْرَجُونَ مِنْهَا</div><p>(So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there), from Hellfire,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ</div><p>(nor shall they be returned to the worldly life.) no apologies shall be sought from them, but they will be punished without limit or delay, just as a group of the believers will enter Paradise without limit or delay. After Allah mentioned His judgement for the believers and the disbelievers, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلِلَّهِ الْحَمْدُ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَرَبِّ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(So all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth,) He is their Owner and the Owner of all that is in and on them, and surely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(and the Lord of all that exists.) Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And His is the majesty in the heavens and the earth, ) meaning, the kingship, according to Mujahid. This Ayah means, Allah is the Almighty, Worthy of all praise; everything and everyone is subservient and in complete need of and dependent upon Him. In an authentic Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا أَسْكَنْتُهُ نَارِي»</div><p>(Allah the Exalted said, \"Glory is My robe and pride is My garment; whoever rivals Me for either of them, I will make him reside in My Fire!\") Muslim collected a similar Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</div><p>(and He is the Al-`Aziz,) Who is never resisted or rivaled,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَكِيمُ</div><p>(Al-Hakim) all wise in His statements, actions, legislation and the decree that He appoints; all glory and praise are due to Him, none has the right to be worshipped but He, Alone. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jathiyah. All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone.</p>"
