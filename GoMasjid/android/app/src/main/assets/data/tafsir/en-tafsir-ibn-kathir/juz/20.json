    "<h2>The Command to praise Allah and send Blessings on His Messengers</h2><p>Allah commands His Messenger to say:</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ</p><p>(Praise and thanks be to Allah,) meaning, for His innumerable blessings upon His servants and for His exalted Attributes and most beautiful Names. And He commands him to send peace upon the servants of Allah whom He chose and selected, i.e., His noble Messengers and Prophets, may the best of peace and blessings from Allah be upon them. This was the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others; the meaning of the servants He has chose is the Prophets. He said, \"This like He said in the Ayah;</p><p>سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ الْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ</p><p>وَسَلَـمٌ عَلَى الْمُرْسَلِينَ - وَالْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</p><p>(Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of honor and power! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him! And peace be on the Messengers! And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, Lord of all that exists.) (37:180-182).\" Ath-Thawri and As-Suddi said, \"This refers to the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ, may Allah be pleased with them all.\" Something similar was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and there is no contradiction between the two views, because they were also among the servants of Allah whom He had chosen, although the description is more befitting of the Prophets.</p><p>ءَآللَّهُ خَيْرٌ أَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p>(Is Allah better, or what they ascribe as partners (to Him)) This is a question aimed at denouncing the idolators for their worship of other gods besides Allah. Some more Proofs of Tawhid Then Allah begins to explain that He is the Only One Who creates, provides and controls, as He says:</p><p>أَمَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ</p><p>(Is not He Who created the heavens) meaning, He created those heavens which are so high and serene, with their shining stars and revolving planets. And He created the earth, with its varying heights and densities, and He created everything in it, mountains, hills, plains, rugged terrain, wildernesses, crops, trees, fruits, seas and animals of all different kinds and colors and shapes, etc.</p><p>وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً</p><p>(and sends down for you water from the sky,) means, He sends it as a provision for His servants,</p><p>فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ</p><p>(whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight) means, beautiful and delightful to behold.</p><p>مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنبِتُواْ شَجَرَهَا</p><p>(It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees.) meaning, `you are not able to cause their trees to grow. The One Who is able to do that is the Creator and Provider, Who is doing all this Alone and Independent of any idol and other rival.' The idolators themselves admitted this, as Allah says in another Ayah:</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you ask them: \"Who has created them\" they will certainly say: \"Allah.\") (31:25)</p><p>وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الاٌّرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And if you were to ask them: \"Who sends down water from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death\" they will surely reply: \"Allah.\") (29:63) Meaning they will admit that He is the One Who does all these things, Alone, with no partner or associate, but then they worship others alongside Him, others who they admit cannot create or provide anything. But the Only One Who deserves to be worshipped is the Only One Who can create and provide, Allah says:</p><p>أَإِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Is there any god with Allah) meaning, `is there any god that can be worshipped alongside Allah, when it is clear to you and anyone who with reason that He is the Creator and Provider, as you yourselves admit' Then Allah says:</p><p>بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ</p><p>(Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!) meaning, they describe others as being equal and comparable to Allah.</p>",
    "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّن جَعَلَ الاٌّرْضَ قَرَاراً</div><p>(Is not He Who has made the earth as a fixed abode,) meaning, stable and stationary, so that it does not move or convulse, because if it were to do so, it would not be a good place for people to live on. But by His grace and mercy, He has made it smooth and calm, and it is not shaken or moved. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ الَّذِى جَعَـلَ لَكُـمُ الاٌّرْضَ قَـرَاراً وَالسَّمَآءَ بِنَـآءً</div><p>(Allah, Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place and the sky as a canopy) (40:64).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ خِلاَلَهَآ أَنْهَاراً</div><p>(and has placed rivers in its midst,) means, He has placed rivers which are fresh and sweet, cutting through the earth, and He has made them of different types, large rivers, small rivers and some in between. He has caused them to flow in all directions, east, west, south, north, according to the needs of mankind in different areas and regions, as He has created them throughout the world and sends them their provision according to their needs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَهَا رَوَاسِىَ</div><p>(and has placed firm mountains therein, ) means, high mountains which stabilize the earth and make it steadfast, so that it does not shake.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ حَاجِزاً</div><p>(and has set a barrier between the two seas) means, He has placed a barrier between the fresh water and the salt water, to prevent them from mixing lest they corrupt one another. Divine wisdom dictates that each of them should stay as it is meant to be. The sweet water is that which flows in rivers among mankind, and it is meant to be fresh and palatable so that it may be used to water animals and plants and fruits. The salt water is that which surrounds the continents on all sides, and its water is meant to be salty and undrinkable lest the air be corrupted by its smell, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخاً وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً </div><p>(And it is He Who has let free the two seas, this is palatable and sweet, and that is salty and bitter; and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.) (25:53) Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءِلـهٌ مَّعَ اللهِ</div><p>(Is there any god with Allah) meaning, any god who could do this, or who deserves to be worshipped Both meanings are indicated by the context.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(Nay, but most of them know not!) means, in that they worship others than Allah.</p>",
    "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ</div><p>(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him) (17:67),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْـَرُونَ</div><p>(Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help) (16:53). Similarly, Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ</div><p>(Is not He Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him,) meaning, Who is the only One to Whom the person in desperate need turns, and the only One Who can relieve those who are stricken by harm Imam Ahmad reported that a man of Balhajim said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what are you calling for\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَدْعُو إِلَى اللهِ وَحْدَهُ الَّذِي إِنْ مَسَّكَ ضُرٌّ فَدَعَوْتَهُ كَشَفَ عَنْكَ، وَالَّذِي إِنْ أَضْلَلْتَ بِأَرْضٍ قَفْرٍ فَدَعَوْتَهُ رَدَّ عَلَيْكَ، وَالَّذِي إِنْ أَصَابَتْكَ سَنَةٌ فَدَعَوْتَهُ أَنْبَتَ لَك»</div><p>(I am calling people to Allah Alone, the One Who, if you call on Him when harm befalls you, will relieve you; and when you are lost in the wilderness, you call on Him and He brings you back: and when drought (famine) strikes, you call on Him and He makes your crops grow.) He said: \"Advise me.\" He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تَسُبَّنَّ أَحَدًا وَلَا تَزْهَدَنَّ فِي الْمَعْرُوفِ، وَلَوْ أَنْ تَلْقَى أَخَاكَ وَأَنْتَ مُنْبَسِطٌ إِلَيْهِ وَجْهُكَ، وَلَوْ أَنْ تُفْرغَ مِنْ دَلْوِكَ فِي إِنَاءِ الْمُسْتَقِي، وَاتَّزِرْ إِلَى نِصْفِ السَّاقِ فَإِنْ أَبَيْتَ فَإِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ، وَإِيَّاكَ وَإِسْبَالَ الْإِزَارِ فَإِنَّ إِسْبَالَ الْإِزَارِ مِنَ الْمَخِيلَةِ وَإِنَّ اللهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمَخِيلَة»</div><p>(Do not slander anyone and do not think of any good deed as insignificant, even if it is only meeting your brother with a cheerful face or emptying your vessel into the vessel of one who is asking for water. Wear your lower garment at mid-calf length, or -- if you insist -- let it reach your ankles, and beware of lowering the garment below the ankles along the ground, for it is a form of showing-off, and Allah does not like showing-off.)</p><h2>The Story of a Mujahid who fought for the sake of Allah</h2><p>In his biography of Fatimah bint Al-Hasan Umm Ahmad Al-`Ajaliyyah, Al-Hafiz bin `Asakir reported that she said: \"One day the disbelievers defeated the Muslims in a battle. There was a good horse which belonged to a rich man who was also righteous. The horse just stood there, so its owner said, `What is the matter with you Woe to you! I was only preparing you for a day such as this.' The horse said to him: `How can you expect me not to perform badly, when you delegated my feeding to the grooms, and they mistreated me and only fed me a little' The man said, `I make you a promise before Allah that from this day on, only I will feed you from my own lap.' So the horse began to run, and his owner was saved, and after that he only ever fed the horse from his own lap. This story became well known among the people, and they started to come to him to hear the story from his own lips. News of this reached the king of Byzantium, and he said: `A city where this man is, will be kept safe from harm.' He wanted to bring the man to his own city, so he sent an apostate (a man who had left Islam) who was living in his city to go to him, and when he reached him, he pretended that his intentions towards Islam and its followers were good, so the Mujahid trusted him. One day they went out walking along the shore, but the apostate made a pact with another person, a follower of the Byzantine king, to come and help him take the Mujahid prisoner. When they made their move, he lifted his gaze to the sky and said, `O Allah! He has deceived me by swearing in Your Name, so protect me in whatever way You will.' Then two wild animals came out and seized them, and the Mujahid came back safe and sound. \" The Inheritance of the Earth</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ حُلَفَآءَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(and makes you inheritors of the earth,) means, each generation inherits from the generation that came before them, one after the other, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِن بَعْدِكُم مَّا يَشَآءُ كَمَآ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ ءَاخَرِينَ</div><p>(if He wills, He can destroy you, and in your place make whom He wills as your successors, as He raised you from the seed of other people) (6:133),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَكُمْ خَلَـئِفَ الاٌّرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَـتٍ</div><p>(And it is He Who has made you generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth. And He has raised you in ranks, some above others) (6:165),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَـئِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِى الأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً</div><p>(And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: \"Verily, I am going to place generations after generations on earth.\") (2:30) meaning, people who will come after one another, as we have already stated. Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ حُلَفَآءَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(and makes you inheritors of the earth,) means, nation after nation, generation after generation, people after people. If He had willed, He could have created them all at one time, and not made some of them the offspring of others. If He had willed, He could have created them all together, as He created Adam from dust. If He had willed, He could have made some of them the offspring of others, but not caused any of them to die until they all died at one time; in this case the earth would have become constricted for them and it would be too difficult for them to live and earn a living, and they would have caused inconvenience and harm to one another. But His wisdom and decree ruled that they should be created from one soul, then their numbers should be greatly increased, so He created them on the earth and made them generation after generation, nation after nation, until their time will come to an end and there will be no one left on earth, as Allah has decreed and as He has completely counted out their numbers. Then the Resurrection will come to pass, and each person will be rewarded or punished according to his deeds. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ السُّوءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ حُلَفَآءَ الاٌّرْضِ أَءِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Is not He Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations Is there any god with Allah) meaning, is there anyone else able to do that, or a god with Allah worth worshipping -- while you know that He is the only one who can do that, having no partners</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</div><p>(Little is that you remember!) meaning, how little they think about that which would guide them to the truth and show them the straight path.</p>",
    "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمَّن يَهْدِيكُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ</div><p>(Is not He Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea,) meaning, by means of what He has created of heavenly and earthly signposts. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلامَـتٍ وَبِالنَّجْمِ هُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ </div><p>(And landmarks and by the stars, they guide themselves.) (16:16)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُواْ بِهَا فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ</div><p>(It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea...)

    "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ - إِنَّهُ هُوَ يُبْدِىءُ وَيُعِيدُ </div><p>(Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful. Verily, He it is Who begins and repeats.) (85:12-13)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ والاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(and Who provides for you from heaven and earth) with the rain He sends down from the sky causing the blessings of the earth to grow, as He says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالسَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ الرَّجْعِ - وَالاّرْضِ ذَاتِ الصَّدْعِ </div><p>(By the sky which gives rain, again and again. And the earth which splits.) (86:11-12)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلْجُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ السَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا</div><p>(He knows that which goes into the earth and that which comes forth from it, and that which descends from the heaven and that which ascends to it) (34:2). Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sends down water from the sky as a blessing, and causes it to penetrate the earth, and then come forth as springs. After that, by means of the water He brings forth all kinds of crops, fruits and flowers, in all their different forms and colors.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَـمَكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى </div><p>(Eat and pasture your cattle; verily, in this are signs for men of understanding) (20:54). Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَإِلَـهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Is there any god with Allah) meaning, who did this Or, according to another interpretation: after this (who could be worth worship)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَـنَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(Say: \"Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.\") Produce the evidence of that. But it is known that they have no proof or evidence, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الْكَـفِرُونَ </div><p>(And whoever invokes besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord.

    "<h2>The One Who knows the Unseen is Allah</h2><p>Allah commands His Messenger to inform all of creation that no one among the dwellers of heaven and earth knows the Unseen, except Allah.</p><p>إِلاَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(except Allah) This is an absolute exception, meaning that no one knows this besides Allah, He is alone in that regard, having no partner in that knowledge.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"That which you wish to hasten on has come close to you, or some of it has come close.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi. This is also what is meant in the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هُوَ قُلْ عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيبًا</div><p>(And they say: \"When will that be\" Say: \"Perhaps it is near!\") (17:51)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(They ask you to hasten on the torment.

Then Allah tells us that He is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens and on earth, and that He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, i.e., that which is unseen by His servants and that which they can see. And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا مِنْ غَآئِبَةٍ</div><p>(and there is nothing hidden) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, there is nothing</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(in the heaven and the earth but it is in a Clear Book.)

    "<h2>The Emergence of the Beast of the Earth</h2><p>This is the beast which will emerge at the end of time, when mankind has become corrupt and neglected the commands of Allah and changed the true religion. Then Allah will cause a beast to emerge from the earth. It was said that it will be brought from Makkah, or from somewhere else, as we shall discuss in detail below, if Allah wills. The beast will speak to people about matters. Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, and it was also narrated from `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that it will speak words, meaning, it will address them. Many Hadiths and reports have been narrated about the beast, and we will narrate as many of them as Allah enables us to, for He is the One Whose help we seek. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out from his room while we were discussing the matter of the Hour. He said:</p><p>«لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَرَوْا عَشْرَ آيَاتٍ: طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانُ وَالدَّابَّةُ وَخُرُوجُ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ، وَخُرُوجُ عِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، وَالدَّجَّالُ، وَثَلَاثَةُ خُسُوفٍ: خَسْفٌ بِالْمَغْرِبِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِالْمَشْرِقِ، وَخَسْفٌ بِجَزِيرَةِ الْعَرَبِ، وَنَارٌ تَخْرُجُ مِنْ قَعْرِ عَدَنٍ تَسُوقُ أَوْ تَحْشُرُ النَّاسَ، تَبِيتُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ بَاتُوا وَتَقِيلُ مَعَهُمْ حَيْثُ قَالُوا»</p><p>(The Hour will not come until you see ten signs: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke (Ad-Dukhan); emergence of the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam, upon him be peace; the Dajjal; and three land cave-ins, one in the west, one in the east and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a Fire which will emerge from the midst of Yemen, and will drive or gather the people, stopping with them whenever they stop for the night or to rest during the day.)\" This was also recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers from Hudhayfah, in a Mawquf report. At-Tirmidhi said, \"It is Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Muslim from Hudhayfah in a Marfu` report. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"I memorized a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ which I never forgot afterwards. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ الْآيَاتِ خُرُوجًا طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَخُرُوجُ الدَّابَّةِ عَلَى النَّاسِ ضُحًى، وَأَيَّتُهُمَا مَا كَانَتْ قَبْلَ صَاحِبَتِهَا فَالْأُخْرَى عَلَى إِثْرِهَا قَرِيبًا»</p><p>(The first of the signs to appear will be the rising of the sun from the west, and the emergence of the beast to mankind in the forenoon. Whichever of them appears first, the other will follow close behind it.)</p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«بَادِرُوا بِالْأَعْمَالِ سِتًّا، طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّجَّالَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، وَخَاصَّةَ أَحَدِكُمْ، وَأَمْرَ الْعَامَّة»</p><p>(Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the Dajjal; the beast; the (death) of one of your favorite, or general affliction.) This was recorded by Muslim alone. Muslim also recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the the Prophet said:</p><p>«بَادِرُوا بِالْأَعْمَالِ سِتًّا: الدَّجَّالَ، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَدَابَّةَ الْأَرْضِ، وَطُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَأَمْرَ الْعَامَّةِ، وَخُوَيْصَّةَ أَحَدِكُم»</p><p>(Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the Dajjal; the smoke; the beast of the earth; the rising of the sun from the west; and the (death of one of your favorite) or general affliction.)</p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Ibn Majah recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«بَادِرُوا بِالْأَعْمَالِ سِتًّا: طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا، وَالدُّخَانَ، وَالدَّابَّةَ، الدَّجَّالَ، وَخُوَيْصَّةَ أَحَدِكُمْ، وَأَمْرَ الْعَامَّة»</p><p>(Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the Dajjal; and the (death of one of your favorite) or general affliction.) He was the only one who recorded this version.</p><h2>Another Hadith</h2><p>Abu Dawud At -Tayalisi recorded f rom Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«تَخْرُجُ دَابَّةُ الْأَرْضِ وَمَعَهَا عَصَا مُوسَى وَخَاتَمُ سُلَيْمَانَ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلَامُ، فَتَخْطِمُ أَنْفَ الْكَافِرِ بِالْعَصَا، وَتُجَلِّي وَجْهَ الْمُؤْمِنِ بِالْخَاتَمِ، حَتَّى يَجْتَمِعَ النَّاسُ عَلَى الْخِوَانِ يُعْرَفُ الْمُؤْمِنُ مِنَ الْكَافِر»</p><p>(A beast will emerge from the earth, and with it will be the staff of Musa and the ring of Sulayman, peace be upon them both. It will strike the nose of the disbelievers with the staff, and it will make the face of the believer bright with the ring, until when people gather to eat, they will be able to recognize the believers from the disbelievers.) It also was recorded by Imam Ahmad, with the wording:</p><p>«فَتَخْطِمُ أَنْفَ الْكَافِر بِالْخَاتَمِ، وَتَجْلُو وَجْهَ الْمُؤْمِن بِالْعَصَا، حَتَّى إِنَّ أَهْلَ الْخِوَانَ الْوَاحِدِ لَيَجْتَمِعُونَ فَيَقُولُ هَذَا: يَا مُؤْمِنُ، وَيَقُولُ هَذَا: يَا كَافِر»</p><p>(It will strike the nose of the disbelievers with the ring, and will make the face of the believer bright with the staff, until when people gather for a meal, they will say to one another, O believer, or O disbeliever.) It was also recorded by Ibn Majah. Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn Az-Zubayr described the beast and said, \"Its head is like the head of a bull, its eyes are like the eyes of a pig, its ears are like the ears of an elephant, its horns are like the horns of a stag, its neck is like the neck of an ostrich, its chest is like the chest of a lion, its color is like the colour of a tiger, its haunches are like the haunches of a cat, its tail is like the tail of a ram, and its legs are like the legs of a camel. Between each pair of its joints is a distance of twelve cubits. It will bring out with it the staff of Musa and the ring of Sulayman. There will be no believer left without it making a white spot on his face, which will spread until all his face is shining white as a result; and there will be no disbeliever left without it making a black spot on his face, which will spread until all his face is black as a result, then when the people trade with one another in the marketplace, they will say, `How much is this, O believer' `How much is this, O disbeliever' And when the members of one household sit down together to eat, they will know who is a believer and who is a disbeliever. Then the beast will say: `O so-and-so, enjoy yourself, for you are among the people of Paradise.' And it will say: `O so-and-so, you are among the people of Hell,' This is what Allah says:</p><p>وَإِذَا وَقَعَ الْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِم أَخْرَجْنَا لَهُمْ دَآبَّةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ أَنَّ النَّاسَ كَانُوا بِـَايَـتِنَا لاَ يُوقِنُونَ</p><p>(And when the Word is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayat.)</p><p>وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ فَوْجاً مِّمَّن يُكَذِّبُ بِـَايَـتِنَا فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ</p>",
    "<h2>Gathering the Wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah tells us about the Day of Resurrection when the wrongdoers who disbelieved in the signs and Messengers of Allah will be gathered before Allah, so that He will ask them about what they did in this world, rebuking, scolding and belittling them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ فَوْجاً</div><p>(And the Day when We shall gather out of every nation, a Fawj) means, from every people and generation a group</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّمَّن يُكَذِّبُ بِـَايَـتِنَا</div><p>(of those who denied Our Ayat).

    "<h2>The Terrors of the Day of Resurrection, the Rewards for Good Deeds and the Punishments for Evil Deed</h2><p>Allah tells us about the terrors of the Day when the Sur will be blown. The Sur, as described in the Hadith, is,</p><p>«قَرْنٌ يُنْفَخُ فِيه»</p><p>(a horn which is blown into.) According to the Hadith about the Sur (Trumpet), it is (the angel) Israfil who will blow into it by the command of Allah, may He be exalted. He will blow into it for the first time, for a long time. This will signal the end of the life of this world, and the Hour will come upon the most evil of people ever to live.

Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that a man came to him and said, \"What is this Hadith that you are narrating, that the Hour will come upon such and such people\" He said, \"Subhan Allah or `La Ilaha Illallah (or something similar), I had decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now.

Then mankind will remain for seven years during which there will not be any enmity between any two people. Then Allah will send a cool wind from the direction of Syria, and no one will be left on the face of the earth who has even a speck of goodness or faith in his heart, but it will take him. Even if he entered into the heart of a mountain, the wind would follow him and seize him.)\" He said, \"I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who said:</p><p>«فَيَبْقَى شِرَارُ النَّاسِ فِي خِفَّةِ الطَّيْرِ وَأَحْلَامِ السِّبَاعِ لَا يَعْرِفُونَ مَعْرُوفًا، وَلَا يُنْكِرُونَ مُنْكَرًا، فَيَتَمَثَّلُ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَيَقُولُ: أَلَا تَسْتَجِيبُونَ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: فَمَا تَأْمُرُنَا؟ فَيَأْمُرُهُمْ بِعِبَادَةِ الْأَوْثَانِ، وَهُمْ فِي ذَلِكَ دَارٌّ رِزْقُهُمْ حَسَنٌ عَيْشُهُمْ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ فَلَا يَسْمَعُهُ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَصْغَى لِيتًا وَرَفَعَ لِيتًا قَالَ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَسْمَعُهُ رَجُلٌ يَلُوطُ حَوْضَ إِبِلِهِ، قَالَ: فَيَصْعَقُ وَيَصْعَقُ النَّاسُ، ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللهُ أَوْ قَالَ يُنْزِلُ اللهُ مَطَرًا كَأَنَّهُ الطَّلُّ أَوْ قَالَ:الظِّلُّ نُعْمَانُ الشَّاكُّ فَتَنْبُتُ مِنْهُ أَجْسَادُ النَّاسِ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ أُخْرَى فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنْظُرُونَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هَلُمُّوا إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ وَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ مَسْؤُولُونَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: أَخْرِجُوا بَعْثَ النَّارِ، فَيُقَالُ: مِنْ كَمْ؟ فَيُقَالُ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ تِسْعَمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ، قَالَ: فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَ يَجْعَلُ الْوِلْدَانُ شِيبًا، وَذَلِكَ يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاق»</p><p>(Then the most evil of people will remain, and they will be as nimble as birds and will be more temperamental than wild beasts.

Then the Sur (Trumpet) will be blown, and no one will hear it but he will tilt his head to hear the sound. The first person to hear it will be a man who is setting up the tank for watering his camels. He will fall down, and all the other people will also fall down. Then Allah will send -- or send down -- rain like dew -- or he said, like shade (Nu'man was the one who was not sure) -- from which will grow the bodies of the people. Then the Trumpet will be blown again, and they will get up and look around. Then it will be said: \"O mankind! Go to your Lord!\" And they will be stopped, for they are to be questioned.

That is the blast of the Sur which will terrify everyone, then after that will come the blast which will cause them to die, then the blast which will resurrect them to meet the Lord of the worlds -- this is when all of the creation will be brought forth from their graves. Allah says:</p><p>وَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ</p><p>(And all shall come to Him, humbled.) meaning, humbling themselves and obeying Him, and no one will go against His command. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ</p><p>(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience) (17:52).</p><p>ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ</p><p>(Then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth) (30:25). According to the Hadith about the Sur, when it is blown for the third time, Allah will command the souls to be put into the hole of the Sur (Trumpet), then Israfil will blow into it, after the bodies have grown in their graves and resting places, and when he blows into the Sur (Trumpet), the souls will fly, the believers' souls glowing with light, and the disbelievers' souls looking like darkness. And Allah will say: \"By My might and majesty, every soul will go back to its body.\" And the souls will come back to their bodies and go through them like poison going through a person who is bitten or stung by a poisonous creature. Then they will get up, brushing off the dirt of their graves.

(27:88) meaning, you will see them as if they are fixed and as if they will remain as they are, but they will pass away as the passing away of the clouds, i.e., they will move away from their places. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً - وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(On the Day when the heaven will shake with a dreadful shaking, And the mountains will move away with a (horrible) movement.)

Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>((And it will be said to them) \"Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do\")</p>",
    "<h2>The Terrors of the Day of Resurrection, the Rewards for Good Deeds and the Punishments for Evil Deed</h2><p>Allah tells us about the terrors of the Day when the Sur will be blown.

I had only said that after a little while, you will see a major event which will destroy the House the Ka`bah, and such and such will happen.\" Then he said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَخْرُجُ الدَّجَّالُ فِي أُمَّتِي فَيَمْكُثُ أَرْبَعِينَ لَا أَدْرِي أَرْبَعِينَ يَوْمًا أَوْ أَرْبَعِينَ شَهْرًا أَوْ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًا فَيَبْعَثُ اللهُ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ كَأَنَّهُ عُرْوَةُ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ فَيَطْلُبُهُ فَيُهْلِكُهُ، ثُمَّ يَمْكُثُ النَّاسُ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ لَيْسَ بَيْنَ اثْنَيْنِ عَدَاوَةٌ، ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللهُ رِيحًا بَارِدَةً مِنْ قِبَلِ الشَّامِ، فَلَا يَبْقَى عَلَى وَجْهِ الْأَرْضِ أَحَدٌ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ خَيْرٍ أَوْ إِيمَانٍ إِلَّا قَبَضَتْهُ، حَتَّى لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ دَخَلَ في كَبِدِ جَبَلٍ لَدَخَلَتْهُ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى تَقْبِضَه»</p><p>(The Dajjal will emerge in my Ummah, and will remain for forty -- I do not know whether he said forty days, or forty months, or forty years -- then Allah will send `Isa son of Maryam, who looks like `Urwah bin Mas`ud, and he will search for him and destroy him. Then mankind will remain for seven years during which there will not be any enmity between any two people. Then Allah will send a cool wind from the direction of Syria, and no one will be left on the face of the earth who has even a speck of goodness or faith in his heart, but it will take him. Even if he entered into the heart of a mountain, the wind would follow him and seize him.)\" He said, \"I heard it from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who said:</p><p>«فَيَبْقَى شِرَارُ النَّاسِ فِي خِفَّةِ الطَّيْرِ وَأَحْلَامِ السِّبَاعِ لَا يَعْرِفُونَ مَعْرُوفًا، وَلَا يُنْكِرُونَ مُنْكَرًا، فَيَتَمَثَّلُ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَيَقُولُ: أَلَا تَسْتَجِيبُونَ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: فَمَا تَأْمُرُنَا؟ فَيَأْمُرُهُمْ بِعِبَادَةِ الْأَوْثَانِ، وَهُمْ فِي ذَلِكَ دَارٌّ رِزْقُهُمْ حَسَنٌ عَيْشُهُمْ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ فَلَا يَسْمَعُهُ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا أَصْغَى لِيتًا وَرَفَعَ لِيتًا قَالَ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَسْمَعُهُ رَجُلٌ يَلُوطُ حَوْضَ إِبِلِهِ، قَالَ: فَيَصْعَقُ وَيَصْعَقُ النَّاسُ، ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللهُ أَوْ قَالَ يُنْزِلُ اللهُ مَطَرًا كَأَنَّهُ الطَّلُّ أَوْ قَالَ:الظِّلُّ نُعْمَانُ الشَّاكُّ فَتَنْبُتُ مِنْهُ أَجْسَادُ النَّاسِ، ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ أُخْرَى فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنْظُرُونَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ هَلُمُّوا إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ وَقِفُوهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ مَسْؤُولُونَ، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: أَخْرِجُوا بَعْثَ النَّارِ، فَيُقَالُ: مِنْ كَمْ؟ فَيُقَالُ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ تِسْعَمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ، قَالَ: فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَ يَجْعَلُ الْوِلْدَانُ شِيبًا، وَذَلِكَ يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاق»</p><p>(Then the most evil of people will remain, and they will be as nimble as birds and will be more temperamental than wild beasts.

The Shaytan will appear to them and will say, \"Will you do as I tell you\" They will say, \"What do you command us to do\" He will command them to worship idols but in spite of this their provision will be plentiful and they will lead comfortable lives. Then the Sur (Trumpet) will be blown, and no one will hear it but he will tilt his head to hear the sound. The first person to hear it will be a man who is setting up the tank for watering his camels. He will fall down, and all the other people will also fall down. Then Allah will send -- or send down -- rain like dew -- or he said, like shade (Nu'man was the one who was not sure) -- from which will grow the bodies of the people. Then the Trumpet will be blown again, and they will get up and look around. Then it will be said: \"O mankind! Go to your Lord!\" And they will be stopped, for they are to be questioned. Then it will be said: \"Bring forth the people who are to be sent to the Fire.\" It will be asked: \"How many are they\" It will be said, \"Out of every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" That will be the Day which will make the children grey-headed, and that will be the Day when the Shin shall be uncovered.)

That is the blast of the Sur which will terrify everyone, then after that will come the blast which will cause them to die, then the blast which will resurrect them to meet the Lord of the worlds -- this is when all of the creation will be brought forth from their graves. Allah says:</p><p>وَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَخِرِينَ</p><p>(And all shall come to Him, humbled.) meaning, humbling themselves and obeying Him, and no one will go against His command. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ</p><p>(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience) (17:52).</p><p>ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ</p><p>(Then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth) (30:25). According to the Hadith about the Sur, when it is blown for the third time, Allah will command the souls to be put into the hole of the Sur (Trumpet), then Israfil will blow into it, after the bodies have grown in their graves and resting places, and when he blows into the Sur (Trumpet), the souls will fly, the believers' souls glowing with light, and the disbelievers' souls looking like darkness. And Allah will say: \"By My might and majesty, every soul will go back to its body.\" And the souls will come back to their bodies and go through them like poison going through a person who is bitten or stung by a poisonous creature. Then they will get up, brushing off the dirt of their graves. Allah says:</p><p>يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ سِرَاعاً كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَى نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal.)

(27:88) meaning, you will see them as if they are fixed and as if they will remain as they are, but they will pass away as the passing away of the clouds, i.e., they will move away from their places. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً - وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(On the Day when the heaven will shake with a dreadful shaking, And the mountains will move away with a (horrible) movement.)

Allah says:</p><p>هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>((And it will be said to them) \"Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do\")</p>",
    "<h2>The Terrors of the Day of Resurrection, the Rewards for Good Deeds and the Punishments for Evil Deed</h2><p>Allah tells us about the terrors of the Day when the Sur will be blown. The Sur, as described in the Hadith, is,</p><p>«قَرْنٌ يُنْفَخُ فِيه»</p><p>(a horn which is blown into.) According to the Hadith about the Sur (Trumpet), it is (the angel) Israfil who will blow into it by the command of Allah, may He be exalted. He will blow into it for the first time, for a long time. This will signal the end of the life of this world, and the Hour will come upon the most evil of people ever to live.

At the same time, he was killing their sons and letting their daughters live, to humiliate them and because he feared that there might appear among them the boy who would be the cause of his destruction and the downfall of his kingdom. So Fir`awn took precautions against that happening, by ordering that all boys born to the Children of Israel should be killed, but this precaution did not protect him against the divine decree, because when the term of Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, and for each and every matter there is a decree from Allah. Allah says:</p><p>وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land,) until His saying;</p><p>يَحْذَرُونَ</p><p>(which they feared.)

Fir`awn hoped that by his strength and power he would be saved from Musa, but that did not help him in the slightest. Despite his great power as a king he could not oppose the decree of Allah, which can never be overcome. On the contrary, Allah's ruling was carried out, for it had been written and decreed from past eternity that Fir`awn would meet his doom at the hands of Musa.</p>",

    "<h2>How Musa's Mother was inspired and shown what to do</h2><p>It was mentioned that when Fir`awn killed so many of the males of the Children of Israel, the Copts were scared that the Children of Israel would die out, and they themselves would have to do the heavy labor that the Children of Israel used to do. So they said to Fir`awn, \"If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it.\" So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى</div><p>(And I endued you with love from Me) (20:39).</p><h2>Musa, peace be upon him, in the House of Fir`awn</h2><p>When Musa's mother became so worried and confused, it was inspired into her heart and mind what she should do, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِى اليَمِّ وَلاَ تَخَافِى وَلاَ تَحْزَنِى إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَـعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ </div><p>(And We inspired the mother of Musa (telling): \"Suckle him, but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers.\") Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْتَقَطَهُ ءَالُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوّاً وَحَزَناً</div><p>(Then the household of Fir`awn picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief.)

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى</div><p>(And I endued you with love from Me) (20:39).</p><h2>Musa, peace be upon him, in the House of Fir`awn</h2><p>When Musa's mother became so worried and confused, it was inspired into her heart and mind what she should do, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِى اليَمِّ وَلاَ تَخَافِى وَلاَ تَحْزَنِى إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَـعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ </div><p>(And We inspired the mother of Musa (telling): \"Suckle him, but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers.\") Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْتَقَطَهُ ءَالُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوّاً وَحَزَناً</div><p>(Then the household of Fir`awn picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief.) Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا كَانُواْ خَـطِئِينَ</div><p>(Verily, Fir`awn, Haman and their armies were sinners.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَتِ امْرَأَتُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ</div><p>(And the wife of Fir`awn said: \"A comfort of the eye for me and for you...\") means, when Fir`awn saw him, he wanted to kill him, fearing that he was one of the Children of Israel. But his wife Asiyah bint Muzahim came to the child's defence and tried to endear him to Fir`awn, saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ</div><p>(A comfort of the eye for me and for you.) Fir`awn said: \"For you he may be, but not for me. And this was indeed the case: Allah guided her because of him, and destroyed him at his hands.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى أَن يَنفَعَنَآ</div><p>(perhaps he may be of benefit to us,) This is indeed what happened in her case, for Allah guided her through him and caused her to dwell in Paradise because of him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَدًا</div><p>(or we may adopt him as a son.) She wanted to take him and adopt him as a son, because she had no children from Fir`awn.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(And they perceived not.) means, they did not know what Allah planned for them when they picked him up, by His great wisdom and definitive proof.</p>",
    "<h2>The intense Grief of Musa's Mother, and how He was returned to Her</h2><p>Allah tells us how, when her child was lost in the river, the heart of Musa's mother became empty, i.e., she could not think of any matter in this world except Musa. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu `Ubaydah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِى بِهِ</div><p>(She was very near to disclose his (case),) means, because of the intensity of her grief, she almost told people that she had lost a son. She would have disclosed her situation, if Allah had not given her strength and patience. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْلا أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَى قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَوَقَالَتْ لأُخْتِهِ قُصِّيهِ</div><p>(had We not strengthened her heart, so that she might remain as one of the believers.

So she went out to do that.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبَصُرَتْ بِهِ عَن جُنُبٍ</div><p>(So she watched him from a far place (secretly),) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Off to the side.\" Mujahid said, \"It means she looked from afar. Qatadah said: \"She started to look at him as if she was not really interested.\" When Musa had settled into the house of Fir`awn, after the king's wife had begun to love him and asked Fir`awn not to kill him, they brought to him the wet nurses who were to be found in their household, and he did not accept any of them, refusing to take milk from them. So they took him out to the marketplace, hoping to find a woman who would be suitable to nurse him. When (his sister) saw him in their arms, she recognized him, but she did not give any indication nor did they suspect her. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(And We had already forbidden foster suckling mothers for him,) Because of his honored status with Allah, it was forbidden by divine decree. It was decreed that no one should nurse him except his own mother, and Allah caused this to be the means reuniting him with his mother so that she could nurse him and feel safe after having felt such fear. When his sister saw that they were confused over who should nurse the child,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَـصِحُونَ</div><p>(she said: \"Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and look after him in a good manner\") Ibn `Abbas said: When she said that, they had some doubts about her, so they seized her and asked her, How do you know these people will be sincere and will care for him\" She said to them, \"They will be sincere and will care for him because they want the king to be happy and because they hope for some reward.\" So they let her go. After what she said, being safe from their harm, they took her to their house and brought the baby to his mother. She gave him her breast and he accepted it, so they rejoiced and sent the glad tidings to the wife of Fir`awn. She called for Musa's mother, treating her kindly and rewarding her generously. She did not realize that she was his real mother, but she saw that the baby accepted her breast. Then Asiyah asked her to stay with her and nurse the baby, but she refused, saying, \"I have a husband and children, and I cannot stay with you, but if you would like me to nurse him in my own home, I will do that.\" The wife of Fir`awn agreed to that, and paid her a regular salary and gave her extra gifts and clothing and treated her kindly. The mother of Musa came back with her child, happy that after a time of fear Allah granted her security, prestige, and ongoing provision. There was only a short time between the distress and the way out, a day and night, or thereabouts -- and Allah knows best. Glory be to the One in Whose hands are all things; what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen.

If Allah wills, you will find me one of the righteous.) means, `I do not want to put pressure on you or cause you any inconvenience or argue with you.' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Rabah Al-Lakhmi said, \"I heard `Utbah bin An-Nadar As-Sulami, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ narrating that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ مُوسَى عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ آجَرَ نَفْسَهُ بِعِفَّةِ فَرْجِهِ وَطُعْمَةِ بَطْنِه»</p><p>(Musa, peace be upon him, hired himself out for the purpose of keeping chaste and to feed himself.) And Allah tells us about Musa, peace be upon him:</p><p>قَالَ ذَلِكَ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ أَيَّمَا الاٌّجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ</p><p>(He said: \"That (is settled) between me and you: whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.\") Musa said to his father-in-law, \"The matter is as you say. You have hired me for eight years, and if I complete ten years, that is my choice, but if I do the lesser amount, I will still have fulfilled the covenant and met the conditions.\" So he said:</p><p>أَيَّمَا الاٌّجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ</p><p>(whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me,) meaning, `there will be no blame on me. The complete term is permissible but it is still regarded as something extra.' This is like the Ayah,</p><p>فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him) (2:203). And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Hamzah bin `Amr Al-Aslami, may Allah be pleased with him, who used to fast a great deal and who asked him about fasting while traveling:</p><p>«إِنْ شِئْتَ فَصُمْ، وَإِنْ شِئْتَ فَأَفْطِر»</p><p>(If you wish, then fast, and if you wish, do not fast.) even though it is better to fast, according to the evidence of other reports. And there is evidence which indicates that Musa, peace be upon him, fulfilled the longer of the two terms. Al-Bukhari recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A Jew from the people of Hirah asked me; `Which of the two terms did Musa fulfill' I said, `I do not know until I go to the scholar of the Arabs and ask him.' So I went to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and asked him. He said: `He fulfilled the longer and better of them, for when a Messenger of Allah ﷺ said he would do a thing, he did it.\"' This is how it was recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p>",

You have hired me for eight years, and if I complete ten years, that is my choice, but if I do the lesser amount, I will still have fulfilled the covenant and met the conditions.\" So he said:</p><p>أَيَّمَا الاٌّجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ</p><p>(whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me,) meaning, `there will be no blame on me. The complete term is permissible but it is still regarded as something extra.' This is like the Ayah,</p><p>فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِى يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him) (2:203).

And there is evidence which indicates that Musa, peace be upon him, fulfilled the longer of the two terms. Al-Bukhari recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"A Jew from the people of Hirah asked me; `Which of the two terms did Musa fulfill' I said, `I do not know until I go to the scholar of the Arabs and ask him.' So I went to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and asked him. He said: `He fulfilled the longer and better of them, for when a Messenger of Allah ﷺ said he would do a thing, he did it.\"' This is how it was recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p>",

    "<h2>Musa's Return to Egypt and how he was honored with the Mission and Miracles on the Way</h2><p>In the explanation of the previous Ayah, we have already seen that Musa completed the longer and better of the two terms, which may also be understood from the Ayah where Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا قَضَى مُوسَى الاٌّجَلَ</div><p>(Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term,) meaning, the longer of the two; and Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ</div><p>(and was traveling with his family,) They said: \"Musa missed his country and his relatives, so he resolved to visit them in secret, without Fir`awn and his people knowing. So he gathered up his family and the flocks which his father-in-law had given to him, and set out on a cold, dark, rainy night. They stopped to camp, and whenever he tried to start a fire, he did not succeed. He was surprised by this, and while he was in this state,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ءَانَسَ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ نَاراً</div><p>(he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur) he saw a fire burning from a far.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالَ لاًّهْلِهِ امْكُثُواْ إِنِّى ءَانَسْتُ نَاراً</div><p>(He said to his family: \"Wait, I have seen a fire...\") meaning, `wait while I go there, '</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّعَلِّى ءَاتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ</div><p>(perhaps I may bring to you from there some information,) This was because they lost their way.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ</div><p>(or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves.) so that they could get warm and find relief from the cold.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ أَتَـهَا نُودِىَ مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ</div><p>(So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley,) From the side of the valley that adjoined the mountain on his right, to the west. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ</div><p>(And you were not on the western side, when We made clear to Musa the commandment) (20:44). This indicates that when Musa headed for the fire, he headed in the direction of the Qiblah with the western mountain on his right. He found the fire burning in a green bush on the side of the mountain adjoining the valley, and he stood there amazed at what he was seeing. Then his Lord called him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ</div><p>(from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exits!) meaning, `the One Who is addressing you and speaking to you is the Lord of all that exits, the One Who does what He wills, the One apart from Whom there is no other god or lord, may He be exalted and sanctified, the One Who by His very nature, attributes, words and deeds is far above any resemblance to His creation, may He be glorified.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ</div><p>(And throw your stick!) `the stick that is in your hand' -- as was stated in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى </div><p>(\"And what is that in your right hand, O Musa\" He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.\") (20:17-18). The meaning is: `this stick, which you know so well;'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ أَلْقِهَا يمُوسَى - فَأَلْقَـهَا فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَى </div><p>(\"Cast it down, O Musa!\" He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.) (20:19-20). Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, \"Be!\" and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّى مُدْبِراً</div><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</div><p>(he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يمُوسَى أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الاٌّمِنِينَ</div><p>(O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.) he came back to his original position. Then Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease;) meaning, `when you put your hand in your garment and then draw it out, it will be shining white as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of lightning.' Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ</div><p>(without a disease) i.e., with no trace of leukoderma.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ</div><p>(and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear.) Mujahid said, \"To be free from terror.\" Qatadah said, \"To be free from fear.\" Musa was commanded, when he felt afraid of anything, to draw his hand close to his side to be free from the fear. If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease. These were two clear and definitive proofs of the power of the One Who does as He chooses, and of the truth of the prophethood of the one at whose hands these miracles occurred. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ</div><p>(to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) meaning his leaders and prominent followers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.) means, who are disobedient towards Allah and who go against His commands and His religion.</p>",

Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, \"Be!\" and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّى مُدْبِراً</div><p>(But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ</div><p>(he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing.

If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease.

Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ</div><p>(to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) meaning his leaders and prominent followers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</div><p>(Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.) means, who are disobedient towards Allah and who go against His commands and His religion.</p>",

So Allah took revenge on him, and made him a lesson to others in this world and the Hereafter. He even confronted Musa with that, and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَئِنِ اتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـهَاً غَيْرِى لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ الْمَسْجُونِينَ</div><p>(If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners) (26:29).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَوْقِدْ لِى يَهَـمَـنُ عَلَى الطِّينِ فَاجْعَل لِّى صَرْحاً لَّعَلِّى أَطَّلِعُ إِلَى إِلَـهِ مُوسَى</div><p>(So kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh in order that I may look at the God of Musa;) He commanded his minister and adviser Haman to bake bricks for him, i.e., to make bricks in order to build a Sarh, a exalted towering palace.

Fir`awn built this tower, which was the highest structure ever seen on earth, because he wanted to show his people that Musa was lying when he claimed that there was a God other than Fir`awn.

    "<h2>Proof of the Prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ</h2><p>Allah points out the proof of the prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ, whereby he told others about matters of the past, and spoke about them as if he were hearing and seeing them for himself.

Similarly, Allah told him about Maryam and her story, as Allah said:</p><p>وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلَـمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ</p><p>(You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam; nor were you with them when they disputed) (3:44), meaning, `you were not present then, but Allah has revealed this to you.'

This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَإِذْ نَادَى رَبُّكَ مُوسَى</p><p>(And (remember) when your Lord called Musa) (26:10).</p><p>إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى</p><p>(When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa) (79:16).</p><p>وَنَـدَيْنَـهُ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ الاٌّيْمَنِ وَقَرَّبْنَاهُ نَجِيّاً</p><p>(And We called him from the right side of At-Tur, and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him) (19:52).</p><p>وَلَـكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ</p><p>(But (you are sent) as a mercy from your Lord,) means, `you were not a witness to any of those things, but Allah has revealed them to you and told you about them as a mercy from Him to you and to His servants, by sending you to them,'</p><p>لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may remember or receive admonition.) means, `so that they may be guided by that which you bring from Allah.'</p><p>وَلَوْلا أَن تُصِيبَهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً</p><p>(And if (We had) not (sent you to the people of Makkah) -- in case a calamity should seize them for (the deeds) that their hands have sent forth, they would have said: \"Our Lord!

This is like what Allah says about the situation after He revealed His blessed Book the Qur'an:</p><p>أَن تَقُولُواْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ الْكِتَـبُ عَلَى طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَـفِلِينَ أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَـبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ</p><p>(Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So, now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy) (6:156-157).</p><p>رُّسُلاً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ</p><p>(Messengers as bearers of good news as well as warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers) (4:165).</p><p>يَـأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَى فَتْرَةٍ مَّنَ الرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا جَآءَنَا مِن بَشِيرٍ وَلاَ نَذِيرٍ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ</p><p>(O People of the Scripture!

And there are many similar Ayat.</p>",
    "<h2>Proof of the Prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ</h2><p>Allah points out the proof of the prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ, whereby he told others about matters of the past, and spoke about them as if he were hearing and seeing them for himself. But he was an illiterate man who could not read books, and he grew up among a people who knew nothing of such things. Similarly, Allah told him about Maryam and her story, as Allah said:</p><p>وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلَـمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ</p><p>(You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam; nor were you with them when they disputed) (3:44), meaning, `you were not present then, but Allah has revealed this to you.' Similarly, Allah told him about Nuh and his people, and how He saved Nuh and drowned his people, then He said:</p><p>تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ الْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَآ أَنتَ وَلاَ قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـذَا فَاصْبِرْ إِنَّ الْعَـقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p>(This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you ; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So, be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have Taqwa) (11:49). And at the end of the same Surah (Hud) Allah says:</p><p>ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ الْقُرَى نَقُصُّهُ عَلَيْكَ</p><p>(That is some of the news of the towns which We relate unto you) (11: 100). And here, after telling the story of Musa from beginning to end and how Allah began His revelation to him and spoke with him, Allah says:</p><p>وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ الْغَرْبِىِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَى مُوسَى الاٌّمْرَ</p><p>(And you were not on the western side (of the Mount), when We made clear to Musa the commandment,) meaning, `you -- O Muhammad -- were not on the western side of the mountain where Allah spoke to Musa from the tree which was to the east of it, in the valley.'</p><p>وَمَا كنتَ مِنَ الشَّـهِدِينَ</p><p>(and you were not among the witnesses.) `to that event, but Allah has revealed this to you,' so that it may be evidence and proof of events which happened centuries ago, for people have forgotten the evidence that Allah established against them and what was revealed to the earlier Prophets.</p><p>وَمَا كُنتَ ثَاوِياً فِى أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا</p><p>(And you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, reciting Our Ayat to them.) meaning, `you were not living among the people of Madyan reciting Our Ayat to them, when you started to tell about Our Prophet Shu`ayb and what he said to his people and how they responded.'</p><p>وَلَكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ</p><p>(But it is We Who kept sending. ) means, `but We revealed that to you and sent you to mankind as a Messenger.'</p><p>وَمَا كُنْتَ بِجَانِبِ الطُّورِ إِذْ نَادَيْنَا</p><p>(And you were not at the side of At-Tur when We called.)

And there are many similar Ayat.</p>",
    "<h2>The stubborn Response of the Disbelievers</h2><p>Allah tells us that if people were to be punished before proof was established against them, they would use the excuse that no Messenger came to them, but when the truth did come to them through Muhammad ﷺ, in their stubbornness, disbelief, ignorance and misguided thinking, they said:</p><p>لَوْلا أُوتِىَ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَى</p><p>(Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa) Meaning -- and Allah knows best -- many signs like the staff, the hand, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood, the destruction of crops and fruits -- which made things difficult for the enemies of Allah -- and the parting of the sea, the clouds (following the Children of Israel in the wilderness and) shading them, the manna and quails, and other clear signs and definitive proof, miracles which Allah wrought at the hands of Musa as evidence and proof against Fir`awn and his chiefs and the Children of Israel. But all of this had no effect on Fir`awn and his chiefs; on the contrary, they denied Musa and his brother Harun, as Allah tells us:</p><p>أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءابَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and that you two may have greatness in the land We are not going to believe you two!) (10:78)</p><p>فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْلَكِينَ</p><p>(So they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed.) (23:48)</p><h2>The Rebellious do not believe in Miracles</h2><p>Allah says here:</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَى مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old) Did not mankind disbelieve in those mighty signs which were given to Musa</p><p>قَالُواْ سِحْرَانِ تَظَـهَرَا</p><p>(They say: \"Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!\") cooperating or working one with the other.</p><p>وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا بِكُلٍّ كَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(And they say: \"Verily, in both we are disbelievers.\") meaning, `we disbelieve in each of them.' Because of the close relationship between Musa and Harun, mention of one includes the other.</p><h2>False Accusation that Musa and Harun (peace be upon them both) practiced Magic</h2><p>Mujahid bin Jabr said, \"The Jews told Quraysh to say this to Muhammad , then Allah said: `Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old They say: Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!' This refers to Musa and Harun, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both,</p><p>تَظَـهَرَا</p><p>(each helping the other) i.e., working together and supporting one another.\" This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Razin that the phrase \"two kinds of magic\" referred to Musa and Harun. This is a good suggestion. And Allah knows best.</p><h2>The Response to this False Accusation</h2><p>سِحْرَانِ تَظَـهَرَا</p><p>(Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this refers to the Tawrah and the Qur'an, because Allah says next:</p><p>قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ</p><p>(Say: \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two that I may follow it.\") Allah often mentions the Tawrah and the Qur'an together, as in the Ayat:</p><p>قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِى جَآءَ بِهِ مُوسَى نُوراً وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ</p><p>(Say: \"Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to mankind...) until:</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down.\") (6:91-92) And at the end of the same Surah, Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ ءاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ تَمَامًا عَلَى الَّذِى أَحْسَنَ</p><p>(Then, We gave Musa the Book, to complete (Our favor) upon those who would do right) (6: 154).</p><p>وَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ</p><p>(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa of Allah, that you may receive mercy) (6:155). And the Jinn said:</p><p>إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</p><p>(Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it) (46:30). Waraqah bin Nawfal said, \"This is An-Namus, who came down to Musa.\" And those who are possessed of insight know instinctively that among the many Books which He has sent down to His Prophets, there is no Book more perfect, more eloquent or more noble than the Book which He revealed to Muhammad ﷺ, which is the Qur'an. Next to it in status and greatness is the Book which Allah revealed to Musa bin `Imran, which is the Book concerning which Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَـبِ اللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَآءَ</p><p>(Verily, We did send down the Tawrah, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests, for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto) (5:44). The Injil was revealed as a continuation and complement of the Tawrah and to permit some of the things that had been forbidden to the Children of Israel. Allah says:</p><p>قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</p><p>(Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful.) meaning, `in your efforts to refute the truth with false arguments.'</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكَ</p><p>(But if they answer you not,) means, `if they do not respond to what you tell them, and do not follow the truth,'</p><p>فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ</p><p>(then know that they only follow their own lusts.) means, with no basis or evidence. p</p><p>وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ اتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ بِغَيْرِ هُدًى مِّنَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts, without guidance from Allah) means, with no guidance taken from the Book of Allah.</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(Verily, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.)</p><p>وَلَقَدْ وَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ الْقَوْلَ</p><p>(And indeed now We have conveyed the Word) Mujahid said: \"We have explained the Word to them.\" As-Suddi said something similar. Qatadah said: \"Allah is saying, `He has told them what He did in the past and what He will do in the future.\"'</p><p>لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(in order that they may remember.)

    "<h2>Allah guides Whom He wills</h2><p>Allah says to His Messenger : `O Muhammad:</p><p>لاَ تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ</p><p>(Verily, you guide not whom you like)' meaning, `the matter does not rest with you; all that you have to do is convey the Message, and Allah will guide whom He wills, and His is the ultimate wisdom,' as He says:</p><p>لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills.)

And He knows best those who are the guided.) meaning: Allah knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be misguided. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that this Ayah was revealed concerning Abu Talib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He used to protect the Prophet, support him and stand by him. He loved the Prophet dearly, but this love was a natural love, i.e., born of kinship, not a love that was born of the fact that he was the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. When he was on his deathbed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called him to Faith and to enter Islam, but the decree overtook him and he remained a follower of disbelief, and Allah's is the complete wisdom. Az-Zuhri said: \"Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib narrated to me that his father, Al-Musayyib bin Hazan Al-Makhzumi, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Abu Talib was dying, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and `Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah with him.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«وَاللهِ مَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا كَمَا يَغْمِسُ أَحَدُكُمْ إِصْبَعَهُ فِي الْيَمِّ، فَلْيَنْظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْه»</p><p>(By Allah, the life of this world in comparison to the Hereafter is as if one of you were to dip his finger in the sea; let him see what comes back to him. ) Allah's saying:</p><p>أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Have you then no sense) means, do those who prefer this world to the Hereafter have no sense</p><p>أَفَمَن وَعَدْنَـهُ وَعْداً حَسَناً فَهُوَ لاَقِيهِ كَمَن مَّتَّعْنَاهُ مَتَـعَ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ هُوَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ</p><p>(Is he whom We have promised an excellent promise -- which he will find true -- like him whom We have made to enjoy the luxuries of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those brought up) Is the one who believes in the reward which Allah has promised in return for righteous deeds, which he will undoubtedly attain, like one who disbelieves in the meeting with Allah and in His promises and threats He is only enjoying a few days in this life,</p><p>ثُمَّ هُوَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ</p><p>(then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those brought up.) Mujahid and Qatadah said: \"He will be among those who are punished.\" It was said that this was revealed concerning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Jahl, or that it was revealed concerning Hamzah and Ali, and Abu Jahl. Both views were narrated from Mujahid. The apparent meaning is that it is more general than that. This is like the Ayah where Allah describes a believer in Paradise looking out at his companion who is in Hell, and saying:</p><p>وَلَوْلاَ نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ</p><p>(Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).) (37:57) And Allah says:</p><p>وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ الجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ</p><p>(but the Jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him)) (37:158).</p>",
    "<h2>The Idolators and Their Partners and the Emnity between Them in the Hereafter</h2><p>Allah informs of how He will rebuke the idolators on the Day of Resurrection, when He will call them and say:</p><p>أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ</p><p>(\"Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert\") meaning, `where are the gods which you used to worship in the world, the idols and rivals Can they help you or save you' This is said in the nature of a rebuke and warning, as in the Ayah,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَّا خَوَّلْنَـكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ وَمَا نَرَى مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَآءَكُمُ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَآءُ لَقَد تَّقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنكُم مَّا كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ</p><p>(And truly, you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time. You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you. We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed to be partners with Allah. Now all relations between you and them have been cut off, and all that you used to claim has vanished from you.) (6:94) His saying:</p><p>قَالَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ</p><p>(Those about whom the Word will have been fulfilled) means the Shayatin and evil Jinn, and those who used to advocate disbelief.</p><p>رَبَّنَا هَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ أَغْوَيْنَآ أَغْوَيْنَـهُمْ كَمَا غَوَيْنَا تَبَرَّأْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كَانُواْ إِيَّانَا يَعْبُدُونَ</p><p>(\"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence before You. It was not us they worshipped.\") They will testify against them and say that they led them astray, then they will declare their innocence of their worship. This is like the Ayat:</p><p>وَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً</p><p>كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً</p><p>(And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.) (19:81-82)</p><p>وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ</p><p>(And who is more astray than one who calls besides Allah, who will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5-6). Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said to his people:</p><p>إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً</p><p>(You have taken idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other.) (29:25)</p><p>إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ</p><p>(When those who were followed disown those who followed, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them) until:</p><p>وَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p>(And they will never get out of the Fire.) (2:166-167). Allah says:</p><p>وَقِيلَ ادْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ</p><p>(And it will be said (to them): \"Call upon your partners,\") meaning, `to save you from the predicament you are in, as you hoped that they would do in this world.'</p><p>فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ</p><p>(and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them, and they will see the torment.) means, they will realize for sure that they are inevitably destined for the Fire. His saying:</p><p>لَوْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَهْتَدُونَ</p><p>(If only they had been guided!) means, when they see the punishment with their own eyes, they will wish that they had been among the guided in this world. This is like the Ayah,</p><p>وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُواْ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقاً - وَرَأَى الْمُجْرِمُونَ النَّارَ فَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا</p><p>(And the Day He will say: \"Call those partners of Mine whom you claimed.\" Then they will cry unto them, but they will not answer them, and We shall put a Mawbiq (a barrier) between them.

Allah says:</p><p>فَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الاٌّنبَـآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ</p><p>(Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that Day, and they will not be able to ask one another.) Mujahid said: \"The proof will be obscured from them,\" so they will not be able to ask one another for help by virtue of their blood ties. Allah's saying:</p><p>فَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً</p><p>(But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds,) means, in this world.</p><p>فَعَسَى أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُفْلِحِينَ</p><p>(then perhaps he will be among those who are successful.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.

    "<h2>Allah informs us how Qarun responded to the exhortations of his people when they sought to guide him</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى</div><p>(He said: \"This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.\") meaning, `I have no need of your advice; Allah has only given me this wealth because He knows that I deserve it and because He loves me. ' In other words: `He has given it to me because He knows that I am fit for this.' This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا مَسَّ الإِنسَـنَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَـهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ</div><p>(When harm touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We have changed it into a favor from Us, he says: \"Only because of knowledge I obtained it.\") (39:49) An alternative interpretation of this Ayah says that the meaning is: \"Only because of what Allah knows about me did I obtain this favor.\" This is like His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـذَا لِى</div><p>(And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity has touched him, he is sure to say: \"This is from me.\") (41:50) meaning, \"I deserved it.\" Imam `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam explained this Ayah very well. Concerning the phrase,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَى عِلْمٍ عِندِى</div><p>(He said: \"This has been given to me only because of the knowledge I possess.\") He said: \"Were it not for the fact that Allah is pleased with me and knows my virtue, He would not have given me this wealth.\" And He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً</div><p>(Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount they had collected) This is what those who have little knowledge say when they see a person whom Allah has granted a lot of wealth; they say that if he did not deserve it, Allah would not have given it to him.</p>",

This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ</div><p>(Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for himself) (41:46). Whoever does a righteous deed, the benefit of that deed will come back to him, for Allah has no need of the deeds of His servants, and even if all of them were to be as pious as the most pious man among them, that would not add to His dominion in the slightest. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن جَاهَدَ فَإِنَّمَا يُجَـهِدُ لِنَفْسِهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِىٌّ عَنِ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allah stands not in need of any of the creatures.) Then Allah tells us that even though He has no need of His creatures, He is kind and generous to them. He will still give to those who believe and do righteous deeds the best of rewards, which is that He will expiate for them their bad deeds, and will reward them according to the best deeds that they did. He will accept the fewest good deeds and in return for one good deed will give anything between ten rewards and seven hundred, but for every bad deed, He will give only one evil merit, or even that He may overlook and forgive. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً </div><p>(Surely, Allah wrongs not even the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) (4:40). And He says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ لَنُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَحْسَنَ الَّذِى كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(Those who believe, and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall expiate from them their evil deeds and We shall indeed reward them according to the best of that which they used to do.)</p>",
    "<p>Allah commands His servants to be dutiful to parents, after urging them to adhere to belief in His Tawhid, because a person's parents are the cause of his existence. So he must treat them with the utmost kindness and respect, his father for spending on him and his mother because of her compassion for him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلاَهُمَا فَلاَ تَقُل لَّهُمَآ أُفٍّ وَلاَ تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلاً كَرِيمًا - وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ مِنَ الرَّحْمَةِ وَقُل رَّبِّ ارْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِى صَغِيرًا </div><p>(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.

And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: \"My Lord!

It is Allah Who will gather you with the group of the righteous, not with the group of your parents, even though you were the closest of people to them in the world.

In the Sahih, it also says:</p><p>«مَا قُتِلَتْ نَفْسٌ ظُلْمًا إِلَّا كَانَ عَلَى ابْنِ آدَمَ الْأَوَّلِ كِفْلٌ مِنْ دَمِهَا، لِأَنَّهُ أَوَّلُ مَنْ سَنَّ الْقَتْل»</p><p>(No person is killed unlawfully, but a share of the guilt will be upon the first son of Adam, because he was the first one to initiate the idea of killing another.)</p><p>وَلَيُسْـَلُنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ</p><p>(and verily, they shall be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about that which they used to fabricate.) means, the lies they used to tell and the falsehood they used to fabricate. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ conveyed the Message with which he was sent, then he said:</p><p>«إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظُّلْمَ، فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَعْزِمُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَقُولُ: وَعِزَّتِي وَجَلَالِي لَا يَجوزُنِي الْيَوْمَ ظُلْمٌ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي مُنَادٍ فَيَقُولُ: أَيْنَ فُلَانُ بْنُ فُلَانٍ؟ فَيَأْتِي يَتْبَعُهُ مِنَ الْحَسَنَاتِ أَمْثَالَ الْجِبَالِ، فَيَشْخَصُ النَّاسُ إِلَيْهَا أَبْصَارَهُمْ، حَتَّى يَقُومَ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الرَّحْمنِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ، ثُمَّ يَأْمُرُ الْمُنَادِيَ فَيُنَادِي: مَنْ كَانَتْ لَهُ تِبَاعَةٌ أَوْ ظَلَامَةٌ عِنْدَ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانٍ فَهَلُمَّ، فَيُقْبِلُونَ حَتَّى يَجْتَمِعُوا قِيَامًا بَيْنَ يَدَيِ الرَّحْمنِ، فَيَقُولُ الرَّحْمنُ: اقْضُوا عَنْ عَبْدِي، فَيَقُولُونَ: كَيْفَ نَقْضِي عَنْهُ؟ فَيَقُولُ: خُذُوا لَهُمْ مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ، فَلَا يَزَالُونَ يَأْخُذُونَ مِنْهَا حَتَّى لَا يَبْقَى مِنْهَا حَسَنَةٌ، وَقَدْ بَقِيَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ الظَّلَامَاتِ، فَيَقُولُ: اقْضُوا عَنْ عَبْدِي، فَيَقُولُونَ: لَمْ يَبْقَ لَهُ حَسَنَةٌ، فَيَقُولُ: خُذُوا مِنْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ فَاحْمِلُوهَا عَلَيْه»</p><p>(Beware of injustice, for Allah will swear an oath of the Day of Resurrection and will say: \"By My glory and majesty, no injustice will be overlooked today.\" Then a voice will call out, \"Where is so-and-so the son of so-and-so\" He will be brought forth, followed by his good deeds which appear like mountains while the people are gazing at them in wonder, until he is standing before the Most Merciful. Then the caller will be commanded to say: \"Whoever is owed anything by so-and-so the son of so-and-so, or has been wronged by him, let him come forth.\" So they will come forth and gather before the Most Merciful, then the Most Merciful will say: \"Settle the matter for My servant.\" They will say, \"How can we settle the matter\" He will say, \"Take from his good deeds and give it to them.\" They will keep taking from his good deeds until there is nothing left, and there will still people with scores to be settled. Allah will say, \"Settle the matter for My servant.\" They will say, \"He does not have even one good deed left.\" Allah will say, \"Take from their evil deeds and give them to him.\") Then the Prophet quoted this Ayah:</p><p>وَلَيَحْمِلُنَّ أَثْقَالَهُمْ وَأَثْقَالاً مَّعَ أَثْقَالِهِمْ وَلَيُسْـَلُنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ</p><p>(And verily, they shall bear their own loads, and other loads besides their own; and verily, they shall be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about that which they used to fabricate.) There is a corroborating report in the Sahih with a different chain of narration:</p><p>«إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِحَسَنَاتٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ وَقَدْ ظَلَمَ هَذَا، وَأَخَذَ مَالَ هَذَا، وَأَخَذَ مِنْ عِرْضِ هَذَا، فَيَأْخُذُ هَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ، وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ، فَإِذَا لَمْ تَبْقَ لَهُ حَسَنَةٌ، أُخِذَ مِنْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ فَطُرِحَ عَلَيْه»</p><p>(A man will come on the Day of Resurrection with good deeds like mountains, but he had wronged this one, taken the wealth of that one and slandered the honor of another. So each of them will take from his good deeds. And if there is nothing left of his good deeds, it will be taken from their evil and placed on him.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Arrogant Claim of the Disbelievers that They would carry theSins of Others if They would return to Disbelief</h2><p>Allah tells us that the disbelievers of Quraysh said to those who believed and followed the truth: leave your religion, come back to our religion, and follow our way;</p><p>وَلْنَحْمِلْ خَطَـيَـكُمْ</p><p>(and let us bear your sins.) meaning, `if there is any sin on you, we will bear it and it will be our responsibility'. It is like a person saying: \"Do this, and your sin will be on my shoulders.\" Allah says, proving this to be a lie:</p><p>وَمَا هُمْ بِحَـمِلِينَ مِنْ خَطَـيَـهُمْ مِّن شَىْءٍ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ</p><p>(Never will they bear anything of their sins. Surely, they are liars.) in their claim that they will bear the sins of others, for no person will bear the sins of another. Allah says:</p><p>وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى</p><p>(and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin) (35:18).</p><p>وَلاَ يَسْـَلُ حَمِيمٌ حَمِيماً يُبَصَّرُونَهُمْ</p><p>(And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition), though they shall be made to see one another) (70:10-11).</p><p>وَلَيَحْمِلُنَّ أَثْقَالَهُمْ وَأَثْقَالاً مَّعَ أَثْقَالِهِمْ</p><p>(And verily, they shall bear their own loads, and other loads besides their own.) Here Allah tells us that those who call others to disbelief and misguidance will, on the Day of Resurrection, bear their own sins and the sins of others, because of the people they misguided. Yet that will not detract from the burden of those other people in the slightest, as Allah says:</p><p>لِيَحْمِلُواْ أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ</p><p>(That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge) (16:25). In the Sahih, it says:</p><p>«مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الْأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا، وَمَنْ دَعَا إِلَى ضَلَالَةٍ كَانَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْإثْمِ مِثْلُ آثَامِ مَنِ اتَّبَعَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ آثَامِهِمْ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(Whoever calls others to true guidance, will have a reward like that of those who follow him until the Day of Resurrection, without it detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever calls others to misguidance, will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him until the Day of Resurrection, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.) In the Sahih, it also says:</p><p>«مَا قُتِلَتْ نَفْسٌ ظُلْمًا إِلَّا كَانَ عَلَى ابْنِ آدَمَ الْأَوَّلِ كِفْلٌ مِنْ دَمِهَا، لِأَنَّهُ أَوَّلُ مَنْ سَنَّ الْقَتْل»</p><p>(No person is killed unlawfully, but a share of the guilt will be upon the first son of Adam, because he was the first one to initiate the idea of killing another.)</p><p>وَلَيُسْـَلُنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ</p><p>(and verily, they shall be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about that which they used to fabricate.) means, the lies they used to tell and the falsehood they used to fabricate.

    "<h2>Nuh and His People</h2><p>Here Allah consoles His servant and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ by telling him that Nuh, peace be upon him, stayed among his people for this long period of time, calling them night and day, in secret and openly, but in spite of all that they still persisted in their aversion to the truth, turning away from it and disbelieving in him. Only a few of them believed with him.

    "<h2>Ibrahim's preaching to His People</h2><p>Allah tells us how His servant, Messenger and close friend Ibrahim, the Imam of the monotheists, called his people to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, to fear Him alone, to seek provision from Him alone, with no partner or associate, to give thanks to Him alone, for He is the One to Whom thanks should be given for the blessings which none can bestow but He. Ibrahim said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاتَّقُوهُ</div><p>(Worship Allah, and have Taqwa of Him,) meaning worship Him and fear Him Alone, with all sincerity.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(that is better for you if you know.) if you do that you will attain good in this world and the next, and you will prevent evil from yourselves in this world and the Hereafter. Then Allah states that the idols which they worshipped were not able to do any harm or any good, and tells them, \"You made up names for them and called them gods, but they are created beings just like you.\" This interpretation was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. It was also the view of Mujahid and As-Suddi. Al-Walibi reported from Ibn `Abbas: \"You invent falsehood, means, you carve idols,\" which do not have the power to provide for you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَابْتَغُواْ عِندَ اللَّهِ الرِّزْقَ</div><p>(so seek from Allah your provision,) This emphasizes the idea of asking Allah Alone. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </div><p>(You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help.) (1:5) And His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ ابْنِ لِى عِندَكَ بَيْتاً فِى الْجَنَّةِ</div><p>(My Lord! Build for me, with You, a home in Paradise) (66:11). Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَابْتَغُواْ</div><p>(so seek) meaning, ask for</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عِندَ اللَّهِ الرِّزْقَ</div><p>(from Allah your provision,) meaning, do not seek it from anyone or anything other than Him, for no one else possesses the power to do anything.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاعْبُدُوهُ وَاشْكُرُواْ لَهُ</div><p>(and worship Him, and be grateful to Him.) Eat from what He has provided and worship Him Alone, and give thanks to Him for the blessings He has given you.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(To Him you will be brought back.) means, on the Day of Resurrection, when He will reward or punish each person according to his deeds.

    "<h2>Ibrahim's preaching to His People</h2><p>Allah tells us how His servant, Messenger and close friend Ibrahim, the Imam of the monotheists, called his people to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, to fear Him alone, to seek provision from Him alone, with no partner or associate, to give thanks to Him alone, for He is the One to Whom thanks should be given for the blessings which none can bestow but He. Ibrahim said to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاتَّقُوهُ</div><p>(Worship Allah, and have Taqwa of Him,) meaning worship Him and fear Him Alone, with all sincerity.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(that is better for you if you know.) if you do that you will attain good in this world and the next, and you will prevent evil from yourselves in this world and the Hereafter. Then Allah states that the idols which they worshipped were not able to do any harm or any good, and tells them, \"You made up names for them and called them gods, but they are created beings just like you.\" This interpretation was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. It was also the view of Mujahid and As-Suddi.

    "<h2>The Evidence for Life after Death</h2><p>Allah tells us that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, showed them the proof of life after death, which they denied, in their souls. For Allah created them after they had been nothing at all, then they came into existence and became people who could hear and see. The One Who originated this is able to repeat it, it is very easy for Him. Then he taught them to contemplate the visible signs on the horizons and the things that Allah has created: the heavens with their stars and planets, moving and stationary, the earth with its plains and mountains, its valleys, deserts and wildernesses, trees and rivers, fruits and oceans. All of that indicates that these are themselves created things, and that there must be a Creator Who does as He chooses, Who merely says to a thing \"Be!\" and it is. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ يُبْدِىءُ اللَّهُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ </div><p>(See they not how Allah originates the creation, then repeats it.

    "<h2>The Evidence for Life after Death</h2><p>Allah tells us that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, showed them the proof of life after death, which they denied, in their souls. For Allah created them after they had been nothing at all, then they came into existence and became people who could hear and see. The One Who originated this is able to repeat it, it is very easy for Him. Then he taught them to contemplate the visible signs on the horizons and the things that Allah has created: the heavens with their stars and planets, moving and stationary, the earth with its plains and mountains, its valleys, deserts and wildernesses, trees and rivers, fruits and oceans. All of that indicates that these are themselves created things, and that there must be a Creator Who does as He chooses, Who merely says to a thing \"Be!\" and it is. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ يُبْدِىءُ اللَّهُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ </div><p>(See they not how Allah originates the creation, then repeats it. Verily, that is easy for Allah.) This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</div><p>(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him) (30:27). Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ بَدَأَ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ اللَّهُ يُنشِىءُ النَّشْأَةَ الاٌّخِرَةَ</div><p>(Say: \"Travel in the land and see how He originated the creation, and then Allah will bring forth the creation of the Hereafter.\") meaning, the Day of Resurrection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(Verily, Allah is able to do all things.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(He punishes whom He wills, and shows mercy to whom He wills;) He is the Ruler Who is in control, Who does as He wishes and judges as He wants, and there is none who can put back His judgement. None can question Him about what He does; rather it is they who will be questioned, for His is the power to create and to command, and whatever He decides is fair and just, for He is the sovereign who cannot be unjust in the slightest. According to a Hadith recorded by the Sunan compilers:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ اللهَ لَوْ عَذَّبَ أَهْلَ سَمَاوَاتِهِ وَأَهْلَ أَرْضِهِ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ وَهُوَ غَيْرُ ظَالِم لَهُم»</div><p>(If Allah willed to punish the dwellers of His heavens and His earth, He would do so, while He would not be unjust to them.) Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُقْلَبُونَ </div><p>(He punishes whom He wills, and shows mercy to whom He wills; and to Him you will be returned.) You will return to Him on the Day of Resurrection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ فِى السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(And you cannot escape on the earth or in the heaven. ) No one in heaven or on earth can flee from Him, for He is the Subduer Who is above His servants, and everything fears Him and is in need of Him, while He is the One Who is Independent of all else.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍوَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِ اللَّهِ وَلِقَآئِهِ</div><p>(And besides Allah you have neither any protector nor any helper.

    "<h2>The Response of Ibrahim's People -- and how Allah controlled the Fire</h2><p>Allah tells us how Ibrahim's people stubbornly and arrogantly disbelieved, and how they resisted the truth with falsehood.

No greater fire had ever been lit. Then they went to Ibrahim, seized him and put him into a catapult, then they threw him into the fire. But Allah made it cool and safe for him, and after spending several days in it, he emerged unscathed. For this reason and others, Allah made him an Imam for mankind, for he offered himself to the Most Merciful, he offered his body to the flames, he offered his son as a sacrifice, and he gave his wealth to care for his guests.

Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَد تَّرَكْنَا مِنْهَآ ءَايَةً بَيِّنَةً</div><p>(And indeed We have left thereof an evident Ayah) i. e., a clear sign, n</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(for a folk who understand.)

    "<h2>Shu`ayb and His People</h2><p>Allah tells us that His servant and Messenger Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, warned his people, the people of Madyan, and commanded them to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and to fear the wrath and punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَارْجُواْ الْيَوْمَ الاٌّخِرَ</div><p>(O my people! Worship Allah and hope for the last Day,) Ibn Jarir said: \"Some of them said that this meant: Fear the Last Day.\" This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الاٌّخِرَ</div><p>(for those who look forward to (meeting with) Allah and the Last Day) (60:6).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ</div><p>(and commit no mischief on the earth as mischief-makers.) This is forbidding them to make mischief on earth by spreading corruption, which means going around doing evil to people. They used to cheat in weights and measures, and ambush people on the road; this is in addition to their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. So Allah destroyed them with a mighty earthquake that convulsed their land, and the Sayhah (shout) which tore their hearts from their bodies, and the torment of the Day of Shade, when their souls were taken. This was the torment of a great day. We have already examined their story in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Hud and Surat Ash-Shu`ara'.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ</div><p>(and they lay, prostrate in their dwellings.)

    "<h2>The Destruction of Nations Who rejected Their Messengers</h2><p>Allah tells us about these nations who disbelieved in their Messengers, and how He destroyed them and sent various kinds of punishments and vengeance upon them. `Ad, the people of Hud, peace be upon him, used to live in the Ahqaf (curved sand-hills), near Hadramawt, in the Yemen.

    "<h2>Likening the gods of the Idolators to the House of a Spider</h2><p>This is how Allah described the idolators in their reverence of gods besides Him, hoping that they would help them and provide for them, and turning to them in times of difficulties. In this regard, they were like the house of a spider, which is so weak and frail, because by clinging to these gods they were like a person who holds on to a spider's web, who does not gain any benefit from that. If they knew this, they would not take any protectors besides Allah. This is unlike the Muslim believer, whose heart is devoted to Allah, yet he still does righteous deeds and follows the Laws of Allah, for he has grasped the most trustworthy handle that will never break because it is so strong and firm. Then Allah warns those who worship others besides Him and associate others with Him that He knows what they do and the rivals they associate with Him. He will punish them for their attribution, for He is All-Wise and All-Knowing. Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ </div><p>(And these are the examples We give for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge.) meaning, no one understands them or ponders them except those who are possessed of deep knowledge.

The Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّهُ سَيَنْهَاهُ مَا تَقُول»</div><p>(What you are saying (i.e., the Salah) will stop him from doing that.)\" Prayer also includes the remembering of Allah, which is the higher objective, Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَذِكْرُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ</div><p>(and the remembrance of Allah is greater indeed.) more important than the former.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَصْنَعُونَ</div><p>(And Allah knows what you do.) means, He knows all that you do and say. Abu Al-`Aliyah commented on the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الصَّلَوةَ تَنْهَى عَنِ الْفَحْشَآءِ وَالْمُنْكَرِ</div><p>(Verily, the Salah prevents from immoral sins and evil wicked deeds) \"Prayer has three attributes, and any prayer that contains none of these attributes is not truly prayer: Being done purely and sincerely for Allah alone (Ikhlas), fear of Allah, and remembrance of Allah. Ikhlas makes a person do good deeds, fear prevents him from doing evil deeds, and the remembrance of Allah is the Qur'an which contains commands and prohibitions.\" Ibn `Awn Al-Ansari said: \"When you are praying, you are doing good, it is keeping you away from immoral sins and evil wicked deeds and what you are doing is part of the remembrance of Allah which is greater.\"</p>"
