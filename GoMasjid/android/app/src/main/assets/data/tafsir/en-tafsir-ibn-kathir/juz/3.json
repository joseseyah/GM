    "<h2>Allah Honored Some Prophets Above Others</h2><p>Allah states that He has honored some Prophets to others. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ النَّبِيِّينَ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا</p><p>(And indeed, We have preferred some of the Prophets above others, and to Dawud We gave the Zabur (Psalms)) 17:55.</p><p>In the Ayah above, Allah said,</p><p>تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّن كَلَّمَ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly)) meaning, Musa and Muhammad , and also Adam according to a Hadith recorded in Sahih Ibn Hibban from Abu Dharr.</p><p>وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَـتٍ</p><p>(Others He raised to degrees (of honor)) as is evident in the Hadith about the Isra' journey, when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saw the Prophets in the various heavens according to their rank with Allah.</p><p>If somebody asks about the collective meaning of this Ayah and the Hadith that the Two Sahihs collected from Abu Hurayrah which states, \"Once, a Muslim man and a Jew had an argument and the Jew said, `No, by Him Who gave Musa superiority over all human beings!' Hearing him, the Muslim man raised his hand and slapped the Jew on his face and said, `Over Muhammad too, O evil one!' The Jew went to the Prophet and complained to him and the Prophet said,</p><p>«لَا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الْأَنْبِيَاءِ، فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ يَصْعَقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُفِيقُ، فَأَجِدُ مُوسَى بَاطِشًا بِقَائِمَةِ الْعَرْشِ، فَلَا أَدْرِي أَفَاقَ قَبْلِي أَمْ جُوزِيَ بِصَعْقَةِ الطُّورِ؟ فَلَا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الْأَنْبِيَاء»</p><p>(Don't give me superiority above the Prophets, for the people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Musa holding on to the pillar of Allah's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness Musa suffered on the Day of the Trumpet sufficed for him, or if he got up before me. So, do not give me superiority above the Prophets.) In another narration, the Prophet said, (Do not give superiority to some Prophets above others.)</p><p>The answer to this question is that this Hadith prohibits preferring some Prophets above others in cases of dispute and argument, such as the incident mentioned in the Hadith. The Hadith indicates that it is not up to creation to decide which Prophet is better, for this is Allah's decision. The creation is only required to submit to, obey and believe in Allah's decision.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَءَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَـتِ</p><p>(And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs) refers to the proofs and unequivocal evidences that testify to the truth that `Isa delivered to the Children of Israel, thus testifying that he was Allah's servant and His Messenger to them.</p><p>وَأَيَّدْنَـهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ</p><p>(And supported him with Ruh-il-Qudus) meaning Allah aided `Isa with Jibil, peace be upon him. Allah then said,</p><p>وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَـتُ وَلَـكِنِ اخْتَلَفُواْ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ ءَامَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُواْ</p><p>(If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed ـ some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another.) meaning all this happened by Allah's decree, and this is why He said next,</p><p>وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ</p><p>(But Allah does what He wills.)</p>",
    "<p>Allah commands His servants to spend for His sake, in the path of righteousness, from what He has granted them, so that they acquire and keep the reward of this righteous deed with their Lord and King. Let them rush to perform this deed in this life, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌ</div><p>(before a Day comes) meaning, the Day of Resurrection, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خُلَّةٌ وَلاَ شَفَـعَةٌ</div><p>(when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession.) </p><p>This Ayah indicates that on that Day, no one will be able to bargain on behalf of himself or ransom himself with any amount, even if it was the earth's fill of gold; nor will his friendship or relation to anyone benefit him. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ </div><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) 23:101. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ شَفَـعَةٌ</div><p>(Nor intercession) meaning, they will not benefit by the intercession of anyone. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْكَـفِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(and it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers) indicates that no injustice is worse than meeting Allah on that Day while a disbeliever. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ata' bin Dinar said, \"All thanks are due to Allah Who said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْكَـفِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(and it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers) but did not say, `And it is the wrongdoers who are the disbelievers.\"' </p>",
    "<h2>The Virtue of Ayat Al-Kursi</h2><p>This is Ayat Al-Kursi and tremendous virtues have been associated with it, for the authentic Hadith describes it as `the greatest Ayah in the Book of Allah.' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Prophet asked him about the greatest Ayah in the Book of Allah, and `Ubayy answered, \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" When the Prophet repeated his question several times, `Ubayy said, \"Ayat Al-Kursi.\" The Prophet commented,</p><p>«لِيَهْنِكَ الْعِلْمُ أَبَا الْمُنْذِرِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، إِنَّ لَهَا لِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ، تُقَدِّسُ الْمَلِكَ عِنْدَ سَاقِ الْعَرْش»</p><p>(Congratulations for having knowledge, O Abu Al-Mundhir! By He in Whose Hand is my soul! This Ayah has a tongue and two lips with which she praises the King (Allah) next to the leg of the Throne.)</p><p>This Hadith was also collected by Muslim, but he did not include the part that starts with, \"By He in Whose Hand...\"</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ayyub said that he had some dates and a Ghoul used to take some, and he complained to the Prophet. The Prophet said to him, \"When you see her, say, `In the Name of Allah, answer to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ'.\" Abu Ayyub said that when she came again, he said these words and he was able to grab her. She begged, \"I will not come again,\" so Abu Ayyub released her. Abu Ayyub went to the Prophet and the Prophet asked him, \"What did your prisoner do\" Abu Ayyub said, \"I grabbed her and she said twice, `I will not come again,' and I released her.\" The Prophet said, \"She will come back.\" Abu Ayyub said, \"So I grabbed her twice or three times, yet each time I would release her when she vowed not to come back. I would go to the Prophet who would ask me, `What is the news of your prisoner' I would say, `I grabbed her, then released her when she said that she would not return.' The Prophet would say that she would return. Once, I grabbed her and she said, `Release me and I will teach you something to recite so that no harm touches you, that is, Ayat Al-Kursi.' Abu Ayyub went to the Prophet and told him, and the Prophet said, \"She is liar, but she told the truth.\" At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith in the chapter of the virtues of the Qur'an and said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" In Arabic, `Ghoul' refers to the Jinn when they appear at night.</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded a similar story in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah, in the chapters on the virtues of the Qur'an and the description of Shaytan. In this narration, Abu Hurayrah said,</p><p>\"Allah's Messenger ﷺ assigned me to keep watch over the Sadaqah (charity) of Ramadan. A person snuck in and started taking handfuls of foodstuff. I caught him and said, `By Allah, I will take you to Allah's Messenger ﷺ.' He said, `Release me, for I am meek and have many dependents and am in great need.' I released him, and in the morning Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked me, `What did your prisoner do yesterday, O Abu Hurayrah' I said, `O Allah's Messenger ﷺ! He complained of being needy and of having many dependents, so I pitied him and let him go.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, `Indeed, he told you a lie and will be coming again.' I believed that he would show up again, for Allah's Messenger ﷺ had told me that he would return. So, I watched for him. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, `I will definitely take you to Allah's Messenger ﷺ.' He said, `Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I promise I will not come back again.' I pitied him and let him go. In the morning Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked me, `What did your prisoner do last night, O Abu Hurayrah!' I replied, `O Allah's Messenger ﷺ! He complained of his great need and of too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, `Verily, he told you a lie; he will return.' I waited for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, `I will surely take you to Allah's Messenger ﷺ as it is the third time you promised not to return, yet you returned.' He said, `Let me teach you some words which Allah will give you benefit from.' I asked, `What are they' He replied, `Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi- Allahu la ilaha illa Huwal-Hayyul-Qayyum, till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no Shaytan will come near you until morning.' So, I released him. In the morning, Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked, `What did your prisoner do yesterday' I replied, `O Allah's Messenger ﷺ! He claimed that he would teach me some words by which Allah will grant me some benefit, so I let him go.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ asked, `What are they' I replied, `He said to me: Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi from the beginning to the end, Allahu la ilaha illa Huwal-Hayyul-Qayyum. He further said to me: (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no Shaytan will come near you until morning.' (One of the narrators) then commented that they (the Companions) were very keen to do good deeds. The Prophet said, `He spoke the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three nights, O Abu Hurayrah' Abu Hurayrah said, `No.' He said, `It was Shaytan.\"' An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith in Al-Yawm wa Al-Laylah.</p><h2>Allah's Greatest Name is in Ayat Al-Kursi</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Yazid bin As-Sakan said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say about these two Ayat,</p><p>اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists) 2:255, and,</p><p>الم - اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Alif-Lam-Mim. Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists) 3:1-2,</p><p>«إِنَّ فِيهِمَا اسْمَ اللهِ الْأَعْظَم»</p><p>(They contain Allah's Greatest Name.)</p><p>This is also the narration collected by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih\".</p><p>Further, Ibn Marduwyah recorded that Abu Umamah reported that the Prophet said,</p><p>«اسْمُ اللهِ الْأَعْظَمُ، الَّذِي إِذَا دُعِيَ بِهِ أَجَابَ، فِي ثَلَاثٍ: سُورَةِ الْبَقَرَةِ وَآلِ عِمْرَانَ وَطه»</p><p>(Allah's Greatest Name, if He was supplicated with it, He answers the supplication, is in three Surahs - Al-Baqarah, Al `Imran and Ta-Ha.)</p><p>Hisham bin `Ammar, the Khatib (orator) of Damascus (one of the narrators in the above narration), said, \"As for Al-Baqarah, it is in,</p><p>اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists) 2:255; in Al `Imran, it is in,</p><p>الم - اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Alif-Lam-Mim. Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists) 3:1-2, while in Ta-Ha, it is in,</p><p>وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ الْقَيُّومِ</p><p>(And (all) faces shall be humbled before (Allah), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists) 20:111.\"</p><h2>Ayat Al-Kursi has Ten Complete Arabic Sentences 1. Allah's statement,</h2><p>اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</p><p>(Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He) mentions that Allah is the One and Only Lord of all creation. 2. Allah's statement,</p><p>الْحَىُّ الْقَيُّومُ</p><p>(Al-Hayyul-Qayyum) testifies that Allah is the Ever Living, Who never dies, Who sustains everyone and everything. All creation stands in need of Allah and totally relies on Him, while He is the Most Rich, Who stands in need of nothing created. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ أَن تَقُومَ السَّمَآءُ وَالاٌّرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ</p><p>(And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command) 30:25. 3. Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ</p><p>(Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him) means, no shortcoming, unawareness or ignorance ever touches Allah. Rather, He is aware of, and controls what every soul earns, has perfect watch over everything, nothing escapes His knowledge, and no secret matter is secret to Him. Among His perfect attributes, is the fact that He is never effected by slumber or sleep. Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ</p><p>(Neither slumber overtakes Him) indicates that no unawareness due to slumber ever overtakes Allah. Allah said afterwards,</p><p>وَلاَ نَوْمٌ</p><p>(nor sleep), which is stronger than slumber. It is recorded in the Sahih that Abu Musa said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ delivered a speech regarding four words:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَللهَلا يَنَامُ، وَلَا يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ، يَخْفِضُ الْقِسْطَ وَيَرْفَعُهُ، يُرْفَعُ إِلَيْهِ عَمَلُ النَّهَارِ قَبْلَ عَمَلِ اللَّيْلِ، وَعَمَلُ اللَّيْلِ قَبْلَ عَمَلِ النَّهَارِ، حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ أَوِ النَّارُ لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لَأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِه»</p><p>(Allah does not sleep, and it does not befit His majesty that He sleeps. He lowers the scales and raises them. The deeds of the day are resurrected in front of Him before the deeds of the night, and the deeds of the night before the deeds of the day. His Veil is light, or fire, and if He removes it, the rays from His Face would burn whatever His sight reaches of His creation.)</p><p>4. Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَـوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth) indicates that everyone is a servant for Allah, a part of His kingdom and under His power and authority. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً</p><p>(There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender)) 19:93-95. 5. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p>(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) is similar to His statements,</p><p>وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ لاَ تُغْنِى شَفَـعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ اللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَى</p><p>(And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with) 53:26, and,</p><p>وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى</p><p>(They cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased) 21:28.</p><p>These Ayat assert Allah's greatness, pride, and grace, and that no one dares to intercede with Him on behalf of anyone else, except by His permission. Indeed, the Hadith about the intercession, states that the Prophet said,</p><p>«آتِي تَحْتَ الْعَرْشِ فَأَخِرُّ سَاجِدًا، فَيَدَعُنِي مَا شَاءَ اللهُ أَنْ يَدَعَنِي. ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: ارْفَعْ رَأْسَكَ، وَقُلْ تُسْمَعْ، وَاشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ قَالَ: فَيَحُدُّ لِي حَدًّا فَأُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(I will stand under the Throne and fall in prostration, and Allah will allow me to remain in that position as much as He wills. I will thereafter be told, \"Raise your head, speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted\". The Prophet then said, \"He will allow me a proportion whom I will enter into Paradise.\")</p><p>6. Allah's statement,</p><p>يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</p><p>(He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter) this refers to His perfect knowledge of all creation; its past, present and future. Similarly, Allah said that the angels proclaimed;</p><p>وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلاَّ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ لَهُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا وَمَا بَيْنَ ذلِكَ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيّاً</p><p>(And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord (O Muhammad ). To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between those two; and your Lord is never forgetful) 19:64. 7. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ</p><p>(And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills), asserts the fact that no one attains any part of Allah's knowledge except what Allah conveys and allows. This part of the Ayah indicates that no one ever acquires knowledge of Allah and in His Attributes, except what He conveys to them. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً</p><p>(But they will never compass anything of His knowledge) 20: 110. 8. Allah said,</p><p>وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَـوَاتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ</p><p>(His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth.)</p><p>Waki` narrated in his Tafsir that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Kursi is the footstool, and no one is able to give due consideration to Allah's Throne.\" Al-Hakim recorded this Hadith in his Mustadrak from Ibn `Abbas, who did not relate it to the Prophet . Al-Hakim said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Sahihs, and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\" In addition, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"If the seven heavens and the seven earths were flattened and laid side by side, they would add up to the size of a ring in a desert, compared to the Kursi.\" 9. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَؤُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</p><p>(And He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them) meaning, it does not burden or cause Him fatigue to protect the heavens and earth and all that is in between them. Rather, this is an easy matter for Him. Further, Allah sustains everything, has perfect watch over everything, nothing ever escapes His knowledge and no matter is ever a secret to Him. All matters are insignificant, modest and humble before Him. He is the Most Rich, worthy of all praise. He does what He wills, and no one can ask Him about what He does, while they will be asked. He has supreme power over all things and perfect alertness concerning everything. He is the Most High, the Greatest, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, and no Lord other than Him.</p><p>10. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُوَ الْعَلِىُّ الْعَظِيمُ</p><p>(And He is the Most High, the Most Great) is similar to His statement,</p><p>الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ</p><p>(the Most Great, the Most High) 13:9.</p><p>These and similar Ayat and authentic Hadiths about Allah's Attributes must be treated the way the Salaf (righteous ancestors) treated them by accepting their apparent meanings without equating them with the attributes of the creation or altering their apparent meanings.</p>",
    "<h2>No Compulsion in Religion</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ</p><p>(There is no compulsion in religion), meaning, \"Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty. Whoever Allah blinds his heart and seals his hearing and sight, then he will not benefit from being forced to embrace Islam.\"</p><p>It was reported that the Ansar were the reason behind revealing this Ayah, although its indication is general in meaning. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that before Islam, \"When (an Ansar) woman would not bear children who would live, she would vow that if she gives birth to a child who remains alive, she would raise him as a Jew. When Banu An-Nadir (the Jewish tribe) were evacuated from Al-Madinah, some of the children of the Ansar were being raised among them, and the Ansar said, `We will not abandon our children.' Allah revealed,</p><p>لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ</p><p>(There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path.)\"</p><p>Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. As for the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to a man,</p><p>«أَسْلِم»</p><p>قَالَ: إِنِّي أَجِدُنِي كَارِهًا قَالَ:</p><p>«وَإِنْ كُنْتَ كَارِهًا»</p><p>(\"Embrace Islam.\" The man said, \"I dislike it.\" The Prophet said, \"Even if you dislike it.\")</p><p>First, this is an authentic Hadith, with only three narrators between Imam Ahmad and the Prophet . However, it is not relevant to the subject under discussion, for the Prophet did not force that man to become Muslim. The Prophet merely invited this man to become Muslim, and he replied that he does not find himself eager to become Muslim. The Prophet said to the man that even though he dislikes embracing Islam, he should still embrace it, `for Allah will grant you sincerity and true intent.'</p><h2>Tawhid is the Most Trustworthy Handhold</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّـغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower) is in reference to, \"Whoever shuns the rivals of Allah, the idols, and those that Shaytan calls to be worshipped besides Allah, whoever believes in Allah's Oneness, worships Him alone and testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, then</p><p>فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى</p><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold.)</p><p>Therefore, this person will have acquired firmness in the religion and proceeded on the correct way and the straight path. Abu Al-Qasim Al-Baghawi recorded that `Umar said, \"Jibt means magic, and Taghut means Shaytan. Verily, courage and cowardice are two instincts that appear in men, the courageous fights for those whom he does not know and the coward runs away from defending his own mother. Man's honor resides with his religion and his status is based upon his character, even if he was Persian or Nabatian.\" `Umar's statement that Taghut is Shaytan is very sound, for this meaning includes every type of evil that the ignorant people of Jahiliyyah (pre Islamic era of ignorace) fell into, such as worshipping idols, referring to them for judgement, and invoking them for victory.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا</p><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break) means, \"He will have hold of the true religion with the strongest grasp.\" Allah equated this adherence to the firm handhold that never breaks because it is built solid and because its handle is firmly connected. This is why Allah said here,</p><p>فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَى لاَ انفِصَامَ لَهَا</p><p>(then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.)</p><p>Mujahid said, \"The most trustworthy handhold is Iman (faith).\" As-Suddi said that it refers to Islam. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qays bin `Abbad said, \"I was in the Masjid when a man whose face showed signs of humbleness came and prayed two Rak`ahs that were modest in length. The people said, `This is a man from among the people of Paradise.' When he left, I followed him until he entered his house, and I entered it after him and spoke with him. When he felt at ease, I said to him, `When you entered the Masjid, the people said such and such things.' He said, `All praise is due to Allah! No one should say what he has no knowledge of. I will tell you why they said that. I saw a vision during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I narrated it to him. I saw that I was in a green garden, ' and he described the garden's plants and spaciousness, `and there was an iron pole in the middle of the garden affixed in the earth and its tip reached the sky. On its tip, there was a handle, and I was told to ascend the pole. I said, `I cannot.' Then a helper came and raised my robe from behind and said to me, `Ascend.' I ascended until I grasped the handle and he said to me, `Hold on to the handle.' I awoke from that dream with the handle in my hand. I went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and told him about the vision and he said,</p><p>«أَمَّا الرَّوْضَةُ فَرَوْضَةُ الْإِسْلَامِ، وَأَمَّا الْعَمُودُ فَعَمُودُ الْإِسْلَامِ، وَأَمَّا الْعُرْوَةُ فَهِيَ الْعُرْوَةُ الْوُثْقَى، أَنْتَ عَلَى الْإِسْلَامِ حَتَّى تَمُوت»</p><p>(As for the garden, it represents Islam; as for the pole, it represents the pillar of Islam; and the handle represents the most trustworthy handhold. You shall remain Muslim until you die.)</p><p>This Companion was `Abdullah bin Salam.\"</p><p>This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs; and Al-Bukhari also recorded it with another chain of narration.</p>",
    "<p>Allah stated that whoever follows what pleases Him, He will guide him to the paths of peace, that is Islam, or Paradise. Verily, Allah delivers His believing servants from the darkness of disbelief, doubt and hesitation, to the light of the plain, clear, explained, easy and unequivocal truth. He also stated that Shaytan is the supporter of the disbelievers who beautifies the paths of ignorance and misguidance that they follow, thus causing them to deviate from the true path into disbelief and wickedness. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُولَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.) </p><p>This is why Allah mentioned the light in the singular while mentioned the darkness in the plural, because truth is one, while disbelief comes as several types, all of which are false. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ذَلِكُمْ وَصَّـكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ </div><p>(And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path.

    "<h2>The Debate Between Ibrahim Al-Khalil and King Nimrod</h2><p>The king who disputed with Ibrahim was King Nimrod, son of Canaan, son of Kush, son of Sam, son of Noah, as Mujahid stated. It was also said that he was Nimrod, son of Falikh, son of `Abir, son of Shalikh, son of Arfakhshand, son of Sam, son of Noah. Mujahid said, \"The kings who ruled the eastern and western parts of the world are four, two believers and two disbelievers. As for the two believing kings, they were Sulayman bin Dawud and Dhul-Qarnayn. As for the two disbelieving kings, they were Nimrod and Nebuchadnezzar.\" Allah knows best. </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ</div><p>(Have you not looked) meaning, \"With your heart, O Muhammad!\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى الَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ</div><p>(at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord) meaning, about the existence of Allah. Nimrod denied the existence of a god other than himself, as he claimed, just as Fir`awn said later to his people, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى</div><p>(I know not that you have a god other than me) 28:38. </p><p>What made Nimrod commit this transgression, utter disbelief and arrant rebellion was his tyranny and the fact that he ruled for a long time. This is why the Ayah continued, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنْ آتَـهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ</div><p>(Because Allah had given him the kingdom. ) </p><p>It appears that Nimrod asked Ibrahim to produce proof that Allah exists. Ibrahim replied, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ</div><p>(My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death) meaning, \"The proof of Allah's existence is the creations that exist after they were nothing and perish after they had existed. This only proves the existence of the Creator, Who does what He wills, for these things could not have occurred on their own without a Creator who created them, and He is the Lord that I call to for worship, Alone without a partner.\" </p><p>This is when Nimrod said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَا أُحْىِ وَأُمِيتُ</div><p>(I give life and cause death.) </p><p>Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ishaq and As-Suddi said that he meant, \"Two men who deserved execution were to be brought before me, and I would command that one of them be killed, and he would be killed. I would command that the second man be pardoned, and he would be pardoned. This is how I bring life and death.\" However, it appears that since Nimrod did not deny the existence of a Creator, his statement did not mean what Qatadah said it meant. This explanation does not provide an answer to what Ibrahim said. Nimrod arrogantly and defiantly claimed that he was the creator and pretended that it was he who brings life and death. Later on, Fir`awn imitated him and announced, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرِى</div><p>(I know not that you have a god other than me) 28: 38. </p><p>This is why Ibrahim said to Nimrod, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِى بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west.) </p><p>This Ayah means, \"You claim that it is you who brings life and death. He who brings life and death controls the existence and creates whatever is in it, including controlling its planets and their movements. For instance, the sun rises everyday from the east. Therefore, if you were god, as you claimed, bringing life and death, then bring the sun from the west.\" Since the king was aware of his weakness, inadequacy and that he was not able to reply to Ibrahim's request, he was idle, silent and unable to comment. Therefore, the proof was established against him. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(And Allah guides not the people, who are wrongdoers) meaning, Allah deprives the unjust people of any valid proof or argument. Furthermore, their false proof and arguments are annulled by their Lord, and they have earned His anger and will suffer severe torment. </p><p>The meaning that we provided is better than the meaning that some philosophers offered, claiming that Ibrahim used the second argument because it was clearer than the first one. Rather, our explanation asserts that Ibrahim refuted both claims of Nimrod, all praise is due to Allah. </p><p>As-Suddi stated that the debate between Ibrahim and Nimrod occurred after Ibrahim was thrown in the fire, for Ibrahim did not meet the king before that day. </p>",
    "<h2>The Story of `Uzayr</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِى حَآجَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ فِى رِبِّهِ</p><p>(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord) means, \"Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord\" Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p><p>أَوْ كَالَّذِى مَرَّ عَلَى قَرْيَةٍ وَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا</p><p>(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs) to the Ayah above by using `or'.</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah 2:259 meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p><p>Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p><p>وَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ</p><p>(in ruin) means, it became empty of people. Allah's statement,</p><p>عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا</p><p>(up to its roofs) indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p><p>أَنَّى يُحْىِ هَـذِهِ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا</p><p>(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death) because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَاتَهُ اللَّهُ مِاْئَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ</p><p>(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</p><p>The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body. When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p><p>كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ</p><p>(\"How long did you remain (dead)\" He (the man) said: \"(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.\")</p><p>The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p><p>أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِاْئَةَ عَامٍ فَانظُرْ إِلَى طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ</p><p>(\"Or part of a day. \" He said: \"Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.\")</p><p>He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p><p>وَانظُرْ إِلَى حِمَارِكَ</p><p>(And look at your donkey!), \"How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.\"</p><p>وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ ءَايَةً لِلنَّاسِ</p><p>(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people) that Resurrection occurs.</p><p>وَانظُرْ إِلَى العِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا</p><p>(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha) meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ read this Ayah,</p><p>كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا</p><p>(how We Nunshizuha.) Al-Hakim said; \"Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.\" The Ayah was also read,</p><p>(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p><p>\"Nunshiruha\" meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p><p>ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا</p><p>(And clothe them with flesh. )</p><p>As-Suddi said, \" `Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys' nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah's leave.\" All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching, and this is when he proclaimed,</p><p>قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(He said, \"I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,\") meaning, \"I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.\"</p>",
    "<h2>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</h2><p>The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod,</p><p>رَبِّيَ الَّذِى يُحْىِ وَيُمِيتُ</p><p>e(My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said,</p><p>رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</p><p>(\"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe\" He (Ibrahim) said: \"Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.\")</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالشَّكِّ مِنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِذْ قَالَ</p><p>رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</p><p>(We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, \"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" Allah said, \"Don't you believe\" Ibrahim said, \"Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.\")</p><p>The Prophet's statement in the Hadith means, \"We are more liable to seek certainty.\"</p><h2>The Answer to Al-Khalil's Request</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ الطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ</p><p>(He said: \"Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.\")</p><p>Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur'an did not mention it. Allah's statement,</p><p>فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ</p><p>(cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim's hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah's leave and power. \" This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</p><p>(And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees.</p><p>`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said,</p><p>وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِى</p><p>(but to be stronger in Faith), \"To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur'an that brings more hope than this Ayah.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, \"Which Ayah in the Qur'an carries more hope for you\" Ibn `Amr said,</p><p>قُلْ يعِبَادِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ لاَ تَقْنَطُواْ</p><p>(Say: \"O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.) 39:53.</p><p>Ibn `Abbas said, \"But I say that it is Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِى كَيْفَ تُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَى</p><p>(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, \"My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.\" He (Allah) said: \"Do you not believe\" He (Ibrahim) said: \"Yes (I believe)...)</p><p>Allah accepted Ibrahim's affirmation when he merely said, `Yes.' This Ayah refers to the doubts that attack the heart and the thoughts that Shaytan inspires.\" Al-Hakim also recorded this in Al-Mustadrak and said; \"Its chain is Sahih but they did not record it.\"</p>",
    "<h2>Rewards of Spending in Allah's Cause</h2><p>This is a parable that Allah made of the multiplication of rewards for those who spend in His cause, seeking His pleasure. Allah multiplies the good deed ten to seven hundred times. Allah said,</p><p>مَّثَلُ الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah...)</p><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr commented, \"Meaning spending in Allah's obedience.\" Makhul said that the Ayah means, \"Spending on Jihad, on horse stalls, weapons and so forth.\" The parable in the Ayah is more impressive on the heart than merely mentioning the number seven hundred. This Ayah indicates that Allah `grows' the good deeds for its doers, just as He grows the plant for whoever sows it in fertile land. The Sunnah also mentions that the deeds are multiplied up to seven hundred folds. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that a man once gave away a camel, with its bridle on, in the cause of Allah and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَتَأْتِيَنَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِسَبْعِمِائَةِ نَاقَةٍ مَخْطُومَة»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, you will have seven hundred camels with their bridles.)</p><p>Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, and Muslim's narration reads, \"A man brought a camel with its bridle on and said, `O Messenger of Allah! This is in the sake of Allah.' The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَكَ بِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ سَبْعُمِائَةِ نَاقَة»</p><p>(You will earn seven hundred camels as reward for it on the Day of Resurrection. )</p><p>Another Hadith: Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ عَمَلِ ابْنِ آدَمَ يُضَاعَفُ، الْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشَرِ أَمْثَالِهَا، إِلَى سَبْعِمِائَةِ ضِعْفٍ، إِلى مَا شَاءَ اللهُ، يَقُولُ اللهُ: إِلَّا الصَّوْمَ فَإِنَّهُ لِي، وَأَنَا أَجْزِي بِهِ، يَدَعُ طَعَامَهُ وَشَهْوَتَهُ مِنْ أَجْلِي، وَلِلصَّائِمِ فَرْحَتَانِ: فَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ فِطْرِهِ وَفَرْحَةٌ عِنْدَ لِقَاءِ رَبِّهِ، وَلَخَلُوفُ فَمِ الصَّائِمِ أَطْيَبُ عِنْدَ اللهِ مِنْ رِيحِ الْمِسْكِ، الصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، الصَّومُ جُنَّة»</p><p>(Every good deed that the son of Adam performs will be multiplied ten folds, to seven hundred folds, to many other folds, to as much as Allah wills. Allah said, \"Except the fast, for it is for Me and I will reward for it. One abandons his food and desire in My sake.\" The fasting person has two times of happiness: when he breaks his fast and when he meets his Lord. Verily, the odor that comes from the mouth of whoever fasts is more pure to Allah than the scent of musk. Fasting is a shield (against sinning), fasting is a shield.) Muslim recorded this Hadith.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ يُضَـعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills) is according to the person's sincerity in his deeds.</p><p>وَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower) meaning, His Favor is so wide that it encompasses much more than His creation, and He has full knowledge in whoever deserves it, or does not deserve it. All the praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>",
    "<h2>To Remind About Charity Given is Forbidden</h2><p>Allah praises those who spend from their money in His cause, and then refrain from reminding those who received the charity of that fact, whether these hints take the form of words or actions.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ أَذًى</p><p>(or with injury), indicates that they do not cause harm to those whom they gave the charity to, for this harm will only annul the charity. Allah next promised them the best rewards for this good deed,</p><p>لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(their reward is with their Lord), indicating that Allah Himself will reward them for these righteous actions. Further,</p><p>وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(On them shall be no fear) regarding the horrors of the Day of Resurrection,</p><p>وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(nor shall they grieve) regarding the offspring that they leave behind and the adornment and delights of this world. They will not feel sorry for this, because they will acquire what is far better for them.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ</p><p>(Kind words) meaning, compassionate words and a supplication for Muslims,</p><p>وَمَغْفِرَةٌ</p><p>(and forgiving) meaning, forgiving an injustice that took the form of actions or words,</p><p>خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى</p><p>(are better than Sadaqah (charity) followed by injury.)</p><p>وَاللَّهُ غَنِىٌّ</p><p>(And Allah is Rich) not needing His creation,</p><p>حَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Most Forbearing) forgives, releases and pardons them.</p><p>There are several Hadiths that prohibit reminding people of acts of charity. For instance, Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«ثَلَاثَةٌ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمُ اللهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَيْهِم، وَلَا يُزَكِّيهِمْ، وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ: الْمَنَّانُ بِمَا أَعْطَى، وَالْمُسْبِلُ إِزَارَهُ، وَالْمُنَفِّقُ سِلْعَتَهُ بِالْحَلِفِ الْكَاذِب»</p><p>(Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection nor look at nor purify, and they shall receive a painful torment: he who reminds (the people) of what he gives away, he who lengthens his clothes below the ankles and he who swears an oath while lying, to sell his merchandise.)</p><p>This is why Allah said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَـتِكُم بِالْمَنِّ وَالاٌّذَى</p><p>(O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury) stating that the charity will be rendered in vain if it is followed by harm or reminders. In this case, the reward of giving away charity is not sufficient enough to nullify the harm and reminders. Allah then said,</p><p>كَالَّذِى يُنفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ النَّاسِ</p><p>(like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men) meaning, \"Do not nullify your acts of charity by following them with reminders and harm, just like the charity of those who give it to show off to people.\" The boasting person pretends to give away charity for Allah's sake, but in reality seeks to gain people's praise and the reputation of being kind or generous, or other material gains of this life.

    "<p>وَتَثْبِيتًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ</p><p>(while they in their own selves are sure and certain) meaning, they are certain that Allah shall reward them for these righteous acts with the best rewards.

Such is the case regarding the believer's good deeds, for they never become barren. Rather, Allah accepts the believer's righteous deeds and increases them, each according to his deeds. This is why Allah said next,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Seer of what you do) meaning, none of His servants' deeds ever escapes His perfect watch.</p>",
    "<h2>The Example of Evil Deeds Nullifying Good Deeds</h2><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas and `Ubayd bin `Umayr said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, \"According to your opinion, about whom was this Ayah revealed,</p><p>أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ</p><p>(Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines...).\"</p><p>They said, \"Allah knows best.\" `Umar became angry and said, \"Say we know or we do not know.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"O Leader of the Faithful! I have an opinion about it.\" `Umar said, \"O my nephew! Say your opinion and do not belittle yourself.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is an example set for a deed.\" `Umar said, \"What type of deed\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"For a wealthy man who works in Allah's pleasure and then Allah sends Shaytan to him, and he works in disobedience, until he annuls his good works.\"</p><p>This Hadith suffices as an explanation for the Ayah, for it explains the example it sets by a person who does good first and then follows it with evil, may Allah save us from this end. So, this man annulled his previous good works with his latter evil works. When he desperately needed the deeds of the former type, there were none. This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ</p><p>(while he is striken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a whirlwind) with heavy wind,</p><p>فِيهِ نَارٌ فَاحْتَرَقَتْ</p><p>(that is fiery, so that it is burnt) meaning, its fruits were burnt and its trees were destroyed. Therefore, what will his condition be like</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah has set a good parable, and all His parables are good. He said,</p><p>أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَتِ</p><p>(Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein.)</p><p>But he lost all this in his old age,</p><p>وَأَصَابَهُ الْكِبَرُ</p><p>(while he is striken with old age) while his offspring and children are weak just before the end of his life. Then a lightning storm came and destroyed his garden. Then he did not have the strength to grow another garden, nor did his offspring offer enough help. This is the condition of the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection when he returns to Allah, for he will not have any good deeds to provide an excuse - or refuge - for him, just as the man in the parable had no strength to replant the garden. The disbeliever will not find anything to resort to for help, just as the offspring of the man in the parable did not provide him with help. So he will be deprived of his reward when he most needs it, just as the man in the parable was deprived of Allah's garden when he most needed it, when he became old and his offspring weak.\"</p><p>In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say in his supplication,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْ أَوْسَعَ رِزْقِكَ عَلَيَ عِنْدَ كِبَرِ سِنِّي وَانْقِضَاءِ عُمُرِي»</p><p>(O Allah! Make Your biggest provision for me when I am old in age and at the time my life ends.)</p><p>This is why Allah said,</p><p>كَذلِكَ يُبيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الآيَـتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(Thus Allah makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought) meaning, comprehend and understand the parables and their intended implications. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَتِلْكَ الاٌّمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ الْعَـلِمُونَ</p><p>(And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allah and His signs)) 29:43.</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ أَنفِقُواْ مِن طَيّبَـتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مّنَ الاْرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُم بِأَخِذِيهِ إِلا أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ الشَّيْطَـنُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَآء وَاللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَاللَّهُ وسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>",
    "<h2>The Encouragement to Spend Honest Money for Allah's Sake</h2><p>Allah commands His believing servants to spend in charity, as Ibn `Abbas stated, from the pure, honest money that they earned and from the fruits and vegetables that He has grown for them in the land. Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah commanded them to spend from the purest, finest and best types of their money and prohibited spending from evil and dishonest money, because Allah is pure and good and only accepts that which is pure and good.\" This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ</p><p>(and do not aim at that which is bad) meaning, filthy (impure) money,</p><p>مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُم بِأَخِذِيهِ</p><p>(to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it) meaning, \"If you were given this type, you would not take it, except if you tolerate the deficiency in it. Verily, Allah is far Richer than you, He is in no need of this money, so do not give, for His sake, what you would dislike for yourselves.\" It was reported that,</p><p>وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it) means, \"Do not spend from the dishonest, impure money instead of the honest, pure money.\"</p><p>Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ أَنفِقُواْ مِن طَيِّبَـتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it,) that it was revealed about the Ansar. When the season for harvesting date-trees would start, the Ansar would collect ripe-date branches from their gardens and hang them on a rope erected between two pillars in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The poor emigrant Companions would eat from these dates. However, some of them (Ansar) would also add lesser type of dates in between ripe-date branches, thinking they are allowed to do so. Allah revealed this Ayah about those who did this,</p><p>وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ الْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنفِقُونَ</p><p>(and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it.)</p><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,</p><p>وَلَسْتُم بِأَخِذِيهِ إِلاَ أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ</p><p>(you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein) means, \"If you had a right on someone who would pay you less than what you gave them, you would not agree until you require more from them to make up the difference. This is why Allah said,</p><p>إِلاَ أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ</p><p>(save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein) meaning, `How do you agree for Me what you do not agree for yourselves, while I have a right to the best and most precious of your possessions\" Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith and Ibn Jarir added, \"And this is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p>لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ</p><p>(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love)\" 4:92</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</p><p>(And know that Allah is Rich (free of all needs), and worthy of all praise) meaning, \"Although Allah commanded you to give away the purest of your money in charity, He is far Richer from needing your charity, but the purpose is that the distance between the rich and the poor becomes less.\" Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَى مِنكُمْ</p><p>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him) 22:37.</p><p>Allah is Rich and free of needing anything from any of His creatures, while all of His creatures stand in need of Him. Allah's bounty encompassing, and what He has never ends. Therefore, whoever gives away good and pure things in charity, let him know that Allah is the Most Rich, His favor is enormous and He is Most Generous, Most Compassionate; and He shall reward him for his charity and multiply it many times. So who would lend to He Who is neither poor nor unjust, Who is worthy of all praise in all His actions, statements, and decisions, of Whom there is neither a deity worthy of worship except Him, nor a Lord other than Him</p><h2>Shaytanic Doubts Concerning Spending in Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الشَّيْطَـنُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَآءِ وَاللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَاللَّهُ وَسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(Shaytan threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahsha'; whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and bounty, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.)</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ لَمَّةً بِابْنِ آدَمَ، وَلِلْمَلَكِ لَمَّةً، فَأَمَّا لَمَّةُ الشَّيطَانِ فَإِيعَادٌ بِالشَّرِّ، وَتَكْذِيبٌ بِالْحَقِّ، وَ أَمَّا لَمَّةُ الْمَلَكِ فَإِيعَادٌ بِالْخَيْرِ، وَتَصْدِيقٌ بِالْحَقِّ، فَمَنْ وَجَدَ ذَلِكَ فَلْيَعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ مِنَ اللهِ، فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ الْأُخْرَى فَلْيَتَعَوَّذْ مِنَ الشَّيْطَان»</p><p>(Shaytan has an effect on the son of Adam, and the angel also has an effect. As for the effect of Shaytan, it is by his threatening with evil repercussions and rejecting the truth. As for the effect of the angel, it is by his promise of a good end and believing in the truth. Whoever finds the latter, let him know that it is coming from Allah and let him thank Allah for it.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«الْجَاهِرُ بِالْقُرْآنِ كَالْجَاهِرِ بِالصَّدَقَةِ، وَالْمُسِرُّ بِالْقُرآنِ كَالْمُسِرِّ بِالصَّدَقَة»</p><p>(He who utters aloud Qur'anic recitation is just like he who discloses charity acts. He who conceals Qur'anic recitation is just like he who conceals charity acts.)</p><p>The Ayah indicates that it is better that acts of charity be concealed, as reiterated by the Hadith that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«سَبْعَةٌ يُظِلُّهُمُ اللهُ فِي ظِلِّهِ يَوْمَ لَا ظِلَّ إلَّا ظِلُّهُ: إِمَامٌ عَادِلٌ، وَشَابٌّ نَشَأَ فِي عِبَادَةِ اللهِ، وَرَجُلَانِ تَحَابَّا فِي اللهِ،اجْتَمَعَا عَلَيْهِ وَتَفَرَّقَا عَلَيْهِ، وَرَجُلٌ قَلْبُهُ مُعَلَّقٌ بِالْمَسْجِدِ، إِذَا خَرَجَ مِنْهُ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْهِ، وَرَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللهَ خَالِيًا فَفَاضَتْ عَيْنَاهُ، وَرَجُلٌ دَعَتْهُ امْرَأَةٌ ذَاتُ مَنْصِبٍ وَجَمَالٍ، فَقَالَ: إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللهَ رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ، وَرَجُلٌ تَصَدَّقَ بِصَدَقَةٍ فَأَخْفَاهَا، حَتَّى لَا تَعْلَمَ شِمَالُهُ مَا تُنْفِقُ يَمِينُه»</p><p>(Allah will give shade to seven on the Day when there will be no shade but His. (They are:) a just ruler, a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake who meet and part in Allah's cause only, a man whose heart is attached to the Masjids from the time he departs the Masjid until he returns to it, a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for illicit intercourse with her and says, `I fear Allah, Lord of the worlds', and a man who gives charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنكُم مِّن سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ</p><p>((Allah) will expiate you some of your sins) means, in return for giving away charity, especially if it was concealed. Therefore, you will gain goodness by your rank being raised, and your sins being forgiven.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p>(And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do) means, \"No good deed that you perform escapes His knowledge, and He shall reward for it.\"</p>",
    "<h2>Giving Charity to Polytheists</h2><p>Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that they, \"Disliked giving charity to their polytheist relatives, but were later on allowed to give it to them when they inquired about this matter, and this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلاًّنفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(Not upon you (Muhammad ) is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not except seeking Allah's Face. And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلاًّنفُسِكُمْ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves) is similar to His other statement,</p><p>مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ</p><p>(Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) his ownself.)</p><p>There are many other similar Ayat in the Qur'an.</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(When you spend not except seeking Allah's Face. )</p><p>Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented, \"Whenever the believer spends, including what he spends on himself, he seeks Allah's Face with it.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that the Ayah means, \"You give away charity for the sake of Allah. Therefore, you will not be asked about the deeds or wickedness of those who receive it.\" This is a sound meaning indicating that when one spends in charity for Allah's sake, then his reward will be with Allah. He will not be asked if the charity unintentionally reached righteous, evil, deserving or undeserving persons, for he will be rewarded for his good intention. The proof to this statement is the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)</p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قَالَ رَجُلٌ: لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ زَانِيَةٍ، فَأَصْبَحَ النَّاسُ يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ غَنِيَ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى غَنِيَ، قَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى غَنِيَ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ سَارِقٍ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى سَارِقٍ، فَقَالَ:اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، وَعَلَى غَنِيَ، وَعَلَى سَارِقٍ. فَأُتِيَ فَقِيلَ لَهُ: أَمَّا صَدَقَتُكَ فَقَدْ قُبِلَتْ، وَأَمَّا الزَّانِيَةُ فَلَعَلَّهَا أَنْ تَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ زِنَاهَا، وَلَعَلَّ الْغَنِيَّ يَعْتَبِرُ فَيُنْفِقُ مِمَّا أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ، وَلَعَلَّ السَّارِقَ أَنْ يَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ سَرِقَتِه»</p><p>(A man said, \"Tonight, I shall give charity.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. The next morning the people said that alms were given to an adulteress. The man said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. Tonight, I shall give alms again.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a wealthy person was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I gave alms) to a wealthy man. Tonight, I shall again give charity.\" So he went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a thief. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a thief was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I have given alms) to an adulteress, a wealthy man and a thief.\" Then, someone came to him and said, \"The alms that you gave away were accepted. As for the adulteress, the alms might make her abstain from adultery. As for the wealthy man, it might make him take a lesson and spend his wealth that Allah has given him. As for the thief, it might make him abstain from stealing.\")</p><h2>Who Deserves Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لِلْفُقَرَآءِ الَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>((Charity is) for the poor, who in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel)) meaning, the migrants who migrated to Allah and His Messenger, resided in Al-Madinah and did not have resources that sufficiently provided them with their needs,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And cannot Darban (move about) in the land) meaning, \"They cannot travel in the land to seek means of livelihood.\" Allah said in other instances using a variation of the word Darban</p><p>وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُواْ مِنَ الصَّلوةِ</p><p>(And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the Salah (the prayer)) 4:101, and,</p><p>أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُمْ مَّرْضَى وَءَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَءَاخَرُونَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَاقْرَءُواْ</p><p>(He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause) 73:20.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ</p><p>(The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty) meaning, those who do not know their situation think that they are well-off, because they are modest in their clothes and speech. There is a Hadith with this meaning that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّهُ التَّمْرَةُ وَالتَّمْرَتَانِ، وَاللُّقْمَةُ وَاللُّقْمَتَانِ، وَالْأُكْلَةُ وَالْأُكْلَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيهِ، وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِ، وَلَا يَسْأَلُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(The Miskin (needy) is not he who wanders about and whose need is sufficed by a date or two, a bite or two or a meal or two. Rather, the Miskin is he who neither has enough resources to sustain him, all the while people are unaware of his need so they do not give to him, nor does he ask people for anything.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ</p><p>(You may know them by their mark) means, \"Those who have good minds discover their situation,\" just as Allah said in other instances,</p><p>سِيمَـهُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces) 48:29, and,</p><p>وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p>(But surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) 47:30. Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْـَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا</p><p>(they do not beg of people at all) means, they do not beg and, thus, do not require people to provide them with more than what they actually need. Indeed, those who ask people for help, while having what suffices for their needs, have begged.</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"My mother sent me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to ask him for help, but when I came by him I sat down. The Prophet faced me and said to me,</p><p>«مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى أَغْنَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَعَفَّ أَعَفَّهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَكَفَّ كَفَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنْ سَأَلَ وَلَهُ قِيمَةُ أُوقِيَّةٍ فَقَدْ أَلْحَف»</p><p>(Whoever felt satisfied, then Allah will enrich him. Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.)</p><p>Abu Sa`id said, \"I said to myself, `I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet for anything.\" This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well) indicates that no charity escapes Him, and He will reward it fully and perfectly on the Day of Resurrection, when it is most desperately needed.</p><h2>Praise for those who Spend in Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ بِالَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُم عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(Those who spend their wealth (in Allah's cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)</p><p>This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas:</p><p>«وَإِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللهِ إِلَّا ازْدَدْتَ بِهَا دَرَجَةً وَرِفْعَةً، حَتَّى مَا تَجْعَلُ فِي فِي امْرَأَتِك»</p><p>(You will not spend charity with which you seek Allah's Face, but you will ascend a higher degree and status because of it, including what you put in your wife's mouth.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمَ إِذَا أَنْفَقَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ نَفَقَةً يَحْتَسِبُهَا، كَانَتْ لَهُ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(When the Muslim spends on his family while awaiting the reward for it from Allah, it will be written as charity for him.)</p><p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(shall have their reward with their Lord), on the Day of Resurrection, as reward for what they spent in acts of obedience. We previously explained the Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.)</p>",

Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.)</p><p>Abu Sa`id said, \"I said to myself, `I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet for anything.\" This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well) indicates that no charity escapes Him, and He will reward it fully and perfectly on the Day of Resurrection, when it is most desperately needed.</p><h2>Praise for those who Spend in Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ بِالَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُم عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(Those who spend their wealth (in Allah's cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)</p><p>This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas:</p><p>«وَإِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللهِ إِلَّا ازْدَدْتَ بِهَا دَرَجَةً وَرِفْعَةً، حَتَّى مَا تَجْعَلُ فِي فِي امْرَأَتِك»</p><p>(You will not spend charity with which you seek Allah's Face, but you will ascend a higher degree and status because of it, including what you put in your wife's mouth.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمَ إِذَا أَنْفَقَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ نَفَقَةً يَحْتَسِبُهَا، كَانَتْ لَهُ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(When the Muslim spends on his family while awaiting the reward for it from Allah, it will be written as charity for him.)</p><p>Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p>(shall have their reward with their Lord), on the Day of Resurrection, as reward for what they spent in acts of obedience. We previously explained the Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.)</p>",
    "<h2>Giving Charity to Polytheists</h2><p>Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that they, \"Disliked giving charity to their polytheist relatives, but were later on allowed to give it to them when they inquired about this matter, and this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلاًّنفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(Not upon you (Muhammad ) is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not except seeking Allah's Face. And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلاًّنفُسِكُمْ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves) is similar to His other statement,</p><p>مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ</p><p>(Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) his ownself.)</p><p>There are many other similar Ayat in the Qur'an.</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ابْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(When you spend not except seeking Allah's Face. )</p><p>Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented, \"Whenever the believer spends, including what he spends on himself, he seeks Allah's Face with it.\" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that the Ayah means, \"You give away charity for the sake of Allah. Therefore, you will not be asked about the deeds or wickedness of those who receive it.\" This is a sound meaning indicating that when one spends in charity for Allah's sake, then his reward will be with Allah. He will not be asked if the charity unintentionally reached righteous, evil, deserving or undeserving persons, for he will be rewarded for his good intention. The proof to this statement is the Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)</p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قَالَ رَجُلٌ: لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ زَانِيَةٍ، فَأَصْبَحَ النَّاسُ يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ غَنِيَ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى غَنِيَ، قَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى غَنِيَ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ سَارِقٍ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى سَارِقٍ، فَقَالَ:اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، وَعَلَى غَنِيَ، وَعَلَى سَارِقٍ. فَأُتِيَ فَقِيلَ لَهُ: أَمَّا صَدَقَتُكَ فَقَدْ قُبِلَتْ، وَأَمَّا الزَّانِيَةُ فَلَعَلَّهَا أَنْ تَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ زِنَاهَا، وَلَعَلَّ الْغَنِيَّ يَعْتَبِرُ فَيُنْفِقُ مِمَّا أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ، وَلَعَلَّ السَّارِقَ أَنْ يَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ سَرِقَتِه»</p><p>(A man said, \"Tonight, I shall give charity.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. The next morning the people said that alms were given to an adulteress. The man said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. Tonight, I shall give alms again.\" He went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a wealthy person was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I gave alms) to a wealthy man. Tonight, I shall again give charity.\" So he went out with his charity and (unknowingly) gave it to a thief. The next morning (the people) said, \"Last night, a thief was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. (I have given alms) to an adulteress, a wealthy man and a thief.\" Then, someone came to him and said, \"The alms that you gave away were accepted. As for the adulteress, the alms might make her abstain from adultery. As for the wealthy man, it might make him take a lesson and spend his wealth that Allah has given him. As for the thief, it might make him abstain from stealing.\")</p><h2>Who Deserves Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>لِلْفُقَرَآءِ الَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>((Charity is) for the poor, who in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel)) meaning, the migrants who migrated to Allah and His Messenger, resided in Al-Madinah and did not have resources that sufficiently provided them with their needs,</p><p>لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِى الاٌّرْضِ</p><p>(And cannot Darban (move about) in the land) meaning, \"They cannot travel in the land to seek means of livelihood.\" Allah said in other instances using a variation of the word Darban</p><p>وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُواْ مِنَ الصَّلوةِ</p><p>(And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the Salah (the prayer)) 4:101, and,</p><p>أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُمْ مَّرْضَى وَءَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَءَاخَرُونَ يُقَـتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَاقْرَءُواْ</p><p>(He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause) 73:20.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ</p><p>(The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty) meaning, those who do not know their situation think that they are well-off, because they are modest in their clothes and speech. There is a Hadith with this meaning that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّهُ التَّمْرَةُ وَالتَّمْرَتَانِ، وَاللُّقْمَةُ وَاللُّقْمَتَانِ، وَالْأُكْلَةُ وَالْأُكْلَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيهِ، وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِ، وَلَا يَسْأَلُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا»</p><p>(The Miskin (needy) is not he who wanders about and whose need is sufficed by a date or two, a bite or two or a meal or two. Rather, the Miskin is he who neither has enough resources to sustain him, all the while people are unaware of his need so they do not give to him, nor does he ask people for anything.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ</p><p>(You may know them by their mark) means, \"Those who have good minds discover their situation,\" just as Allah said in other instances,</p><p>سِيمَـهُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p>(The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces) 48:29, and,</p><p>وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p>(But surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) 47:30. Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يَسْـَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا</p><p>(they do not beg of people at all) means, they do not beg and, thus, do not require people to provide them with more than what they actually need. Indeed, those who ask people for help, while having what suffices for their needs, have begged.</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"My mother sent me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to ask him for help, but when I came by him I sat down. The Prophet faced me and said to me,</p><p>«مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى أَغْنَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَعَفَّ أَعَفَّهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَكَفَّ كَفَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنْ سَأَلَ وَلَهُ قِيمَةُ أُوقِيَّةٍ فَقَدْ أَلْحَف»</p><p>(Whoever felt satisfied, then Allah will enrich him. Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.)</p><p>Abu Sa`id said, \"I said to myself, `I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet for anything.\" This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well) indicates that no charity escapes Him, and He will reward it fully and perfectly on the Day of Resurrection, when it is most desperately needed.</p><h2>Praise for those who Spend in Charity</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَلَهُمْ بِالَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُم عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(Those who spend their wealth (in Allah's cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)</p><p>This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family.

We previously explained the Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p>(there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Punishment for Dealing with Riba (Interest and Usury)</h2><p>After Allah mentioned the righteous believers who give charity, pay Zakah and spend on their relatives and families at various times and conditions, He then mentioned those who deal in usury and illegally acquire people's money, using various evil methods and wicked ways. Allah describes the condition of these people when they are resurrected from their graves and brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection:</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ</p><p>(Those who eat Riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity.)</p><p>This Ayah means, on the Day of Resurrection, these people will get up from their graves just as the person afflicted by insanity or possesed by a demon would. Ibn `Abbas said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, those who consume Riba will be resurrected while insane and suffering from seizures.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded this and then commented, \"This Tafsir was reported from `Awf bin Malik, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Samurah bin Jundub said in the long Hadith about the dream that the Prophet had,</p><p>«فَأَتْينَا عَلَى نَهْرٍ حَسِبْتُ أَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ: أَحْمَرَ مِثْلَ الدَّمِ، وَإِذَا فِي النَّهْرِ رَجُلٌ سَابِحٌ يَسْبَحُ، وَإِذَا عَلَى شَطِّ النَّهْرِ رَجُلٌ قَدْ جَمَعَ عِنْدَهُ حِجَارَةً كَثِيرَةً،وَإِذَا ذَلِكَ السَّابِحُ يَسْبَحُ مَا يَسْبَحُ، ثُمَّ يَأْتِي ذَلِكَ الَّذِي قَدْ جَمَعَ الْحِجَارَةَ عِنْدَهُ، فَيَفْغَرُ لَهُ فَاهُ فَيُلْقِمُهُ حَجَرًا»</p><p>(We reached a river -the narrator said, \"I thought he said that the river was as red as blood\"- and found that a man was swimming in the river, and on its bank there was another man standing with a large collection of stones next to him. The man in the river would swim, then come to the man who had collected the stones and open his mouth, and the other man would throw a stone in his mouth.)</p><p>The explanation of this dream was that the person in the river was one who consumed Riba.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَواْ وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَواْ</p><p>(That is because they say: \"Trading is only like Riba,\" whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba) indicates that the disbelievers claimed that Riba was allowed due to the fact that they rejected Allah's commandments, not that they equated Riba with regular trade. The disbelievers did not recognize that Allah allowed trade in the Qur'an, for if they did, they would have said, \"Riba is trade.\" Rather, they said,</p><p>إِنَّمَا الْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ الرِّبَواْ</p><p>(Trading is only like Riba) meaning, they are similar, so why did Allah allow this, but did not allow that, they asked in defiance of Allah's commandments.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَحَلَّ اللَّهُ الْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ الرِّبَواْ</p><p>(Whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba) might be a continuation of the answer to the disbelievers' claim, who uttered it, although they knew that Allah decided that ruling on trade is different from that of Riba. Indeed, Allah is the Most Knowledgeable, Most Wise, Whose decision is never resisted. Allah is never asked about what He does, while they will be asked. He is knowledgeable of the true reality of all things and the benefits they carry. He knows what benefits His servants, so He allows it for them, and what harms them, so He forbids them from it. He is more merciful with them than the mother with her own infant.</p><p>Thereafter, Allah said,</p><p>فَمَن جَآءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّنْ رَّبِّهِ فَانتَهَى فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p>(So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge),) meaning, those who have knowledge that Allah made usury unlawful, and refrain from indulging in it as soon as they acquire this knowledge, then Allah will forgive their previous dealings in Riba,</p><p>عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَف</p><p>(Allah has forgiven what is past.)</p><p>On the day Makkah was conquered the Prophet said,</p><p>«وَكُلُّ رِبًا فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ مَوْضُوعٌ تَحْتَ قَدَمَيَ هَاتَيْنِ، وَأَوَّلُ رِبًا أَضَعُ، رِبَا الْعَبَّاس»</p><p>(All cases of Riba during the time of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic period of ignorance) is annulled and under my feet, and the first Riba I annul is the Riba of Al-'Abbas (the Prophet's uncle).)</p><p>We should mention that the Prophet did not require the return of the interest that they gained on their Riba during the time of Jahiliyyah. Rather, he pardoned the cases of Riba that occured in the past, just as Allah said,</p><p>فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p>(shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge).)</p><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said that,</p><p>فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ</p><p>(shall not be punished for the past) refers to the Riba one consumed before it was prohibited. Allah then said,</p><p>وَمَنْ عَادَ</p><p>(But whoever returns) meaning, deals in Riba after gaining knowledge that Allah prohibited it, then that warrants punishment, and in this case, the proof will have been established against such person. This is why Allah said,</p><p>فَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(such are the dwellers of the Fire ـ they will abide therein forever.)</p><p>Abu Dawud recorded that Jabir said, \"When</p><p>الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ الرِّبَواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ الَّذِى يَتَخَبَّطُهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مِنَ الْمَسِّ</p><p>(Those who eat Riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ لَمْ يَذَرِ الْمُخَابَرَةَ فَلْيُؤْذِنْ بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللهِ وَرَسُولِه»</p><p>(Whoever does not refrain from Mukhabarah, then let him receive a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)\"</p><p>Al-Hakim also recorded this in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"It is Sahih according to the criteria of Muslim, and he did not record it.\" Mukhabarah (sharecropping), farming land in return for some of its produce, was prohibited. Muzabanah, trading fresh dates still on trees with dried dates already on the ground, was prohibited. Muhaqalah, which refers to trading produce not yet harvested, with crops already harvested, was also prohibited. These were prohibited to eradicate the possibility that Riba might be involved, for the quality and equity of such items are only known after they become dry.</p><p>The subject of Riba is a difficult subject for many scholars. We should mention that the Leader of the Faithful, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, said, \"I wished that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had made three matters clearer for us, so that we could refer to his decision: the grandfather (regarding inheriting from his grandchildren), the Kalalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs) and some types of Riba.\" `Umar was refering to the types of transactions where it is not clear whether they involve Riba or not. The Shari`ah supports the rule that for any matter that is unlawful, then the means to it are also unlafwful, because whatever results in the unlawful is unlawful, in the same way that whenever an obligation will not be complete except with something, then that something is itself an obligation.</p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْحَلَالَ بَيِّنٌ وَإِنَّ الْحَرَامَ بَيِّنٌ، وَبَيْنَ ذَلِكَ أُمُورٌ مُشْتَبِهَاتٌ، فَمَنِ اتَّقَى الشُّبُهَاتِ اسْتَبْرَأَ لِدِينِهِ وَعِرْضِهِ، وَمَنْ وَقَعَ فِي الشُّبُهَاتِ وَقَعَ فِي الْحَرَامِ، كَالرَّاعِي يَرْعَى حَولَ الْحِمَى يُوشِكُ أَنْ يَرْتَعَ فِيه»</p><p>(Both lawful and unlawful things are evident, but in between them there are matters that are not clear. So whoever saves himself from these unclear matters, he saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these unclear matters, he will have fallen into the prohibitions, just like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near a private pasture, at any moment he is liable to enter it.)</p><p>The Sunan records that Al-Hasan bin `Ali said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«دَعْ مَا يَرِيبُكَ إِلَى مَا لَا يَرِيبُك»</p><p>(Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.)</p><p>Ahmad recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that `Umar said, \"The Ayah about Riba was one of the last Ayat to be revealed, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died before he explained it to us.

The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,</p><p>«لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ، حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّحُومُ فَجَمَلُوهَا فَبَاعُوهَا، وَأَكَلُوا أَثْمَانَهَا»</p><p>(May Allah curse the Jews! Allah forbade them to eat animal fat, but they melted it and sold it, eating its price.)</p><p>`Ali and Ibn Mas`ud narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَعَنَ اللهُ آكِلَ الرِّبَا وَمُوكِلَهُ وَشَاهِدَيْهِ وَكَاتِبَه»</p><p>(May Allah curse whoever consumes Riba, whoever pays Riba, the two who are witnesses to it, and the scribe who records it.)</p><p>They say they only have witnesses and a scribe to write the Riba contract when they want it to appear to be a legitimate agreement, but it is still invalid because the ruling is applied to the agreement itself, not the form that it appears in. Verily, deeds are judged by their intentions. d</p>",
    "<h2>Allah Does Not Bless Riba</h2><p>Allah states that He destroys Riba, either by removing this money from those who eat it, or by depriving them of the blessing, and thus the benefit of their money. Because of their Riba, Allah will torment them in this life and punish them for it on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said,</p><p>قُل لاَّ يَسْتَوِى الْخَبِيثُ وَالطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ الْخَبِيثِ</p><p>(Say: \"Not equal are Al-Khabith (evil things) and At-Tayyib (good things), even though the abundance of Al-Khabith may please you\") 5:100</p><p>وَيَجْعَلَ الْخَبِيثَ بَعْضَهُ عَلَى بَعْضٍ فَيَرْكُمَهُ جَمِيعاً فَيَجْعَلَهُ فِى جَهَنَّمَ</p><p>(And put the wicked (disbelievers and doers of evil deeds) one over another, heap them together and cast them into Hell) 8:37, and,</p><p>وَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُمْ مِّن رِّباً لِّيَرْبُوَاْ فِى أَمْوَالِ النَّاسِ فَلاَ يَرْبُواْ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And that which you give in gift (to others), in order that it may increase (your wealth by expecting to get a better one in return) from other people's property, has no increase with Allah) 30:39.</p><p>Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement,</p><p>يَمْحَقُ اللَّهُ الْرِّبَواْ</p><p>(Allah will destroy Riba) is similar to the statement reported of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, \"Riba will end up with less, even if it was substantial.\" Imam Ahmad recorded a similar statement in Al-Musnad.</p><h2>Allah Increases Charity, Just as One Raises His Animal</h2><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَيُرْبِى الصَّدَقَـتِ</p><p>(And will give increase for Sadaqat) means, Allah makes charity grow, or He increases it.

There is a connection between the beginning of the Ayah on Riba and what Allah ended it with. Those who consume Riba are not satisfied with the permissible and pure resources that Allah provided them. Instead, they try to illegally acquire people's money by relying on evil methods. This demonstrates their lack of appreciation for the bounty that Allah provides.</p><h2>Praising Those Who Thank Allah</h2><p>Allah praised those who believe in His Lordship, obey His commands, thank Him and appreciate Him. They are those who are kind to His creation, establish prayer and give charity due on their money. Allah informed them of the honor that He has prepared for them and that they will be safe from the repercussions of the Day of Resurrection.

    "<h2>The Necessity of Taqwa and Avoiding Riba</h2><p>Allah commands His believing servants to fear Him and warns them against what would bring them closer to His anger and drive them away from His pleasure. Allah said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah) meaning, fear Him and remember that He is watching all that you do.</p><p>وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الرِّبَواْ</p><p>(And give up what remains of Riba) meaning, abandon the Riba that people still owe you upon hearing this warning,</p><p>إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(if you indeed have been believers) believing in the trade that He allowed you and the prohibition of Riba. Zayd bin Aslam, Ibn Jurayj, Muqatil bin Hayyan and As-Suddi said that this Ayah was revealed about Bani `Amr bin `Umayr, a sub-tribe of Thaqif, and Bani Al-Mughirah, from the tribe of Bani Makhzum, between whom were outstanding transactions of Riba leftover from time of Jahiliyyah. When Islam came and both tribes became Muslims, Thaqif required Bani Al-Mughirah to pay the Riba of that transaction, but Bani Al-Mughirah said, \"We do not pay Riba in Islam.\" `Attab bin Usayd, the Prophet's deputy on Makkah, wrote to the Messenger of Allah about this matter. This Ayah was then revealed and the Messenger of Allah conveyed it to `Attab,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الرِّبَواْ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)</p><p>They said, \"We repent to Allah and abandon whatever is left of our Riba\", and they all abandoned it This Ayah serves as a stern threat to those who continue to deal in Riba after Allah revealed this warning.</p><h2>Riba Constitutes War Against Allah and His Messenger</h2><p>Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ</p><p>(then take a notice of war) means, \"Be sure of a war from Allah and His Messenger.\" He also said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, those who eat Riba will be told, `take up arms for war.\"' He then recited,</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)</p><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said about,</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger,) \"Whoever kept dealing with Riba and did not refrain from it, then the Muslim Leader should require him to repent. If he still did not refrain from Riba, the Muslim Leader should cut off his head.\"</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>وَإِن تُبتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَلِكُمْ لاَ تَظْلِمُونَ</p><p>(But if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly) by taking the Riba,</p><p>وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And you shall not be dealt with unjustly) meaning, your original capital will not diminish. Rather, you will receive only what you lent without increase or decrease. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Al-Ahwas said, \"The Messenger of Allah gave a speech during the Farewell Hajj saying;</p><p>«أَلَا إِنَّ كُلَّ رِبًا كَانَ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ، مَوْضُوعٌ عَنْكُمْ كُلُّهُ، لَكُمْ رُؤُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُم لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَاتُظْلَمُونَ، وَأَوَّلُ رِبًا مَوْضُوعٍ، رِبَا الْعَبَّاسِ بْنِ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ مَوْضُوعٌ كُلُّه»</p><p>(Verily, every case of Riba from the Jahiliyyah is completely annulled. You will only take back your capital, without increase or decrease. The first Riba that I annul is the Riba of Al-`Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib, all of it is annulled.)</p><h2>Being Kind to Debtors Who Face Financial Difficulties</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسَرَةٍ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And if the debtor is having a hard time, then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know.)

I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I heard you say, `Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will gain charity of equal proportions for each day he gives.' I also heard you say, `Whoever gives time to a debtor facing hard times, will earn charity multiplied by two times for each day he gives.' He said,</p><p>«لَهُ بِكُلِّ يَومٍ مِثْلُهُ صَدَقَةٌ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَحِلَّ الدَّيْنُ، فَإِذَا حَلَّ الدَّيْنُ فَأَنْظَرَهُ، فَلَهُ بِكُلِّ يَوْمٍ مِثْلَاهُ صَدَقَة»</p><p>(He will earn charity of equal proportions for each day (he gives time) before the term of the debt comes to an end, and when the term comes to an end, he will again acquire charity multiplied by two times for each day if he gives more time.)\"</p><p>Ahmad recorded that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that Abu Qatadah had a debt on a man, who used to hide from Abu Qatadah when he looked for him to pay what he owed him. One day, Abu Qatadah came looking for the debtor and a young boy came out, and he asked him about the debtor and found out that he was in the house eating. Abu Qatadah said in a loud voice, \"O Fellow! Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.\" The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, \"Why are you hiding from me\" The man said, \"I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.\" Abu Qatadah said, \"By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time\" He said, \"Yes.\" Abu Qatadah cried and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ،كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.)\"</p><p>Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih.</p><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ: مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا؟ فَقَالَ: مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ آخِرِهَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ، وَكُنْتُ رَجُلًا أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ، وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ، فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ، قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ: أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ، ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, \"What deeds did you perform for Me in your life\" He will say, \"O Lord! In my life, I have not performed a deed for Your sake that equals an atom,\" three times. The third time, the servant will add, \"O Lord! You granted me wealth and I used to be a merchant. I used to be lenient, giving easy terms to those well-off and giving time to the debtors who faced hard times.\" Allah will say, \"I Am the Most Worthy of giving easy terms. Therefore, enter Paradise.\")</p><p>Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith from Hudhayfah, and Muslim recorded a similar wording from `Uqbah bin `Amir and Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri. Allah further advised His servants, by reminding them that this life will soon end and all the wealth in it will vanish. He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. Allah also warned them against His torment,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah. Then every person shall be paid what he earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.)</p><p>It was reported that this was the last Ayah revealed from the Glorious Qur'an. An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The last Ayah to be revealed from the Qur'an was,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.

One day, Abu Qatadah came looking for the debtor and a young boy came out, and he asked him about the debtor and found out that he was in the house eating. Abu Qatadah said in a loud voice, \"O Fellow! Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.\" The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, \"Why are you hiding from me\" The man said, \"I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.\" Abu Qatadah said, \"By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time\" He said, \"Yes.\" Abu Qatadah cried and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ،كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.)\"</p><p>Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih.</p><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ: مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا؟ فَقَالَ: مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ آخِرِهَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ، وَكُنْتُ رَجُلًا أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ، وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ، فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ، قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ: أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ، ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, \"What deeds did you perform for Me in your life\" He will say, \"O Lord!

He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. Allah also warned them against His torment,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.

    "<h2>The Necessity of Taqwa and Avoiding Riba</h2><p>Allah commands His believing servants to fear Him and warns them against what would bring them closer to His anger and drive them away from His pleasure. Allah said,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah) meaning, fear Him and remember that He is watching all that you do.</p><p>وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الرِّبَواْ</p><p>(And give up what remains of Riba) meaning, abandon the Riba that people still owe you upon hearing this warning,</p><p>إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(if you indeed have been believers) believing in the trade that He allowed you and the prohibition of Riba. Zayd bin Aslam, Ibn Jurayj, Muqatil bin Hayyan and As-Suddi said that this Ayah was revealed about Bani `Amr bin `Umayr, a sub-tribe of Thaqif, and Bani Al-Mughirah, from the tribe of Bani Makhzum, between whom were outstanding transactions of Riba leftover from time of Jahiliyyah. When Islam came and both tribes became Muslims, Thaqif required Bani Al-Mughirah to pay the Riba of that transaction, but Bani Al-Mughirah said, \"We do not pay Riba in Islam.\" `Attab bin Usayd, the Prophet's deputy on Makkah, wrote to the Messenger of Allah about this matter. This Ayah was then revealed and the Messenger of Allah conveyed it to `Attab,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الرِّبَواْ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)</p><p>They said, \"We repent to Allah and abandon whatever is left of our Riba\", and they all abandoned it This Ayah serves as a stern threat to those who continue to deal in Riba after Allah revealed this warning.</p><h2>Riba Constitutes War Against Allah and His Messenger</h2><p>Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ</p><p>(then take a notice of war) means, \"Be sure of a war from Allah and His Messenger.\" He also said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, those who eat Riba will be told, `take up arms for war.\"' He then recited,</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger.)</p><p>`Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said about,</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ</p><p>(And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger,) \"Whoever kept dealing with Riba and did not refrain from it, then the Muslim Leader should require him to repent. If he still did not refrain from Riba, the Muslim Leader should cut off his head.\"</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>وَإِن تُبتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُءُوسُ أَمْوَلِكُمْ لاَ تَظْلِمُونَ</p><p>(But if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly) by taking the Riba,</p><p>وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And you shall not be dealt with unjustly) meaning, your original capital will not diminish. Rather, you will receive only what you lent without increase or decrease. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Al-Ahwas said, \"The Messenger of Allah gave a speech during the Farewell Hajj saying;</p><p>«أَلَا إِنَّ كُلَّ رِبًا كَانَ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ، مَوْضُوعٌ عَنْكُمْ كُلُّهُ، لَكُمْ رُؤُوسُ أَمْوَالِكُم لَا تَظْلِمُونَ وَلَاتُظْلَمُونَ، وَأَوَّلُ رِبًا مَوْضُوعٍ، رِبَا الْعَبَّاسِ بْنِ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِبِ مَوْضُوعٌ كُلُّه»</p><p>(Verily, every case of Riba from the Jahiliyyah is completely annulled.

Come out, for I was told that you are in the house.\" The man came out and Abu Qatadah asked him, \"Why are you hiding from me\" The man said, \"I am having a hard time financially, and I do not have any money.\" Abu Qatadah said, \"By Allah, are you truly facing a hard time\" He said, \"Yes.\" Abu Qatadah cried and said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p>«مَنْ نَفَّسَ عَنْ غَرِيمِهِ أَوْ مَحَا عَنْهُ،كَانَ فِي ظِلِّ الْعَرْشِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Whoever gives time to his debtor, or forgives the debt, will be in the shade of the Throne (of Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.)\"</p><p>Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih.</p><p>Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أُتِيَ اللهُ بِعَبْدٍمِنْ عَبِيدِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ قَالَ: مَاذَا عَمِلْتَ لِي فِي الدُّنْيَا؟ فَقَالَ: مَا عَمِلْتُ لَكَ يَا رَبِّ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي الدُّنْيَا أَرْجُوكَ بِهَا قَالَهَا ثَلَاثَ مَرَّاتٍ قَالَ الْعَبْدُعِنْدَ آخِرِهَا: يَا رَبِّ إِنَّكَ كُنْتَ أَعْطَيْتَنِي فَضْلَ مَالٍ، وَكُنْتُ رَجُلًا أُبَايِعُ النَّاسَ، وَكَانَ مِنْ خُلُقِي الْجَوازُ، فَكُنْتُ أُيَسِّرُ عَلَى الْمُوسِرِ وَأُنْظِرُ الْمُعْسِرَ، قَالَ: فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّوَجَلَّ: أَنَا أَحَقُّ مَنْ يُيَسِّرُ، ادْخُلِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(On the Day of Resurrection, one of Allah's servants will be summoned before Him and He will ask him, \"What deeds did you perform for Me in your life\" He will say, \"O Lord! In my life, I have not performed a deed for Your sake that equals an atom,\" three times. The third time, the servant will add, \"O Lord! You granted me wealth and I used to be a merchant. I used to be lenient, giving easy terms to those well-off and giving time to the debtors who faced hard times.\" Allah will say, \"I Am the Most Worthy of giving easy terms. Therefore, enter Paradise.\")</p><p>Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith from Hudhayfah, and Muslim recorded a similar wording from `Uqbah bin `Amir and Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri. Allah further advised His servants, by reminding them that this life will soon end and all the wealth in it will vanish. He also reminded them that the Hereafter will surely come, when the Return to Him will occur, and that He will hold His creation accountable for what they did, rewarding them or punishing them accordingly. Allah also warned them against His torment,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah. Then every person shall be paid what he earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.)</p><p>It was reported that this was the last Ayah revealed from the Glorious Qur'an. An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The last Ayah to be revealed from the Qur'an was,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ يَوْمًا تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And have Taqwa for the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah. Then every person shall be paid what he earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.\")</p><p>This is the same narration reported by Ad-Dahhak and Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas.</p>",
    "<h2>The Necessity of Writing Transactions That Take Effect Later on</h2><p>This Ayah is the longest in the Glorious Qur'an. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that he was told that the Ayah most recently revealed from above the Throne -- the last Ayah to be revealed in the Qur'an -- was the Ayah about debts.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا تَدَايَنتُم بِدَيْنٍ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَاكْتُبُوهُ</p><p>(O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down) directs Allah's believing servants to record their business transactions when their term is delayed, to preserve the terms and timing of these transactions, and the memory of witnesses, as mentioned at the end of the Ayah,</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَـدَةِ وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ</p><p>(that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves.)</p><p>The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ came to Al-Madinah, while the people were in the habit of paying in advance for fruits to be delivered within one or two years. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ أَسْلَفَ، فَلْيُسْلِفْ فِي كَيْلٍ مَعْلُومٍ، وَوَزْنٍ مَعْلُومٍ، إِلَى أَجَلٍ مَعْلُوم»</p><p>(Whoever pays money in advance (for dates to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified measure and weight (of the dates) for a specified date. )</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>فَاكْتُبُوهُ</p><p>(write it down) is a command from Him to record such transactions to endorse and preserve their terms. Ibn Jurayj said, \"Whoever borrowed should write the terms, and whoever bought should have witnesses.\" Abu Sa`id, Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Hasan, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said that recording such transactions was necessary before, but was then abrogated by Allah's statement,</p><p>فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِى اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَـنَتَهُ</p><p>(Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُم كَاتِبٌ بِالْعَدْلِ</p><p>(Let a scribe write it down in justice between you) and in truth. Therefore, the scribe is not allowed to cheat any party of the contract and is to only record what the parties of the contract agreed to, without addition or deletion. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ</p><p>(Let not the scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him, so let him write) means, \"Those who know how to write should not refrain from writing transaction contracts when asked to do so.\" Further, let writing such contracts be a type of charity from the scribe for those who are not lettered, just as Allah taught him what he knew not. Therefore, let him write, just as the Hadith stated,</p><p>«إِنَّ مِنَ الصَّدَقَةِ أَنْ تُعِينَ صَانِعًا، أَوْ تَصْنَعَ لِأَخْرَق»</p><p>(It is a type of charity to help a worker and to do something for a feeble person.)</p><p>In another Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ كَتَمَ عِلْمًا يَعْلَمُهُ، أُلْجِمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِلِجَامٍ مِنْ نَار»</p><p>(Whoever kept knowledge to himself will be restrained by a bridle made of fire on the Day of Resurrection.) Mujahid and `Ata' said that if asked to do so, \"The scribe is required to record.\"</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلْيُمْلِلِ الَّذِى عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ</p><p>(Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must have Taqwa of Allah, his Lord) indicates that the debtor should dictate to the scribe what he owes, so let him fear Allah,</p><p>وَلاَ يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً</p><p>(And diminish not anything of what he owes,) meaning, not hide any portion of what he owes.</p><p>فَإن كَانَ الَّذِى عَلَيْهِ الْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا</p><p>(But if the debtor is of poor understanding) and is not allowed to decide on such matters, because he used to waste money, for instance,</p><p>أَوْ ضَعِيفًا</p><p>(Or weak), such as being too young or insane,</p><p>أَوْ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ</p><p>(Or is unable to dictate for himself) because of a disease, or ignorance about such matters,</p><p>فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِالْعَدْلِ</p><p>(then let his guardian dictate in justice.)</p><h2>Witnesses Should Attend the Dictation of Contracts</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَاسْتَشْهِدُواْ شَهِيدَيْنِ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ</p><p>(And get two witnesses out of your own men) requiring witnesses to attend the dictation of contracts to further preserve the contents,</p><p>فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَامْرَأَتَانِ</p><p>(And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women) this requirement is only for contracts that directly or indirectly involve money. Allah requires that two women take the place of one man as witness, because of the woman's shortcomings, as the Prophet described. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَا مَعْشَرَ النِّسَاءِ تَصَدَّقْنَ وَأَكْثِرْنَ الْاسْتِغْفَارَ، فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُكُنَّ أَكْثَرَ أَهْلِ النَّار»</p><p>(O women! Give away charity and ask for forgiveness, for I saw that you comprise the majority of the people of the Fire.)</p><p>One eloquent woman said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Why do we comprise the majority of the people of the Fire\" He said,</p><p>«تُكْثِرْنَ اللَّعْنَ، وَتَكْفُرْنَ الْعَشِيرَ، وَمَا رَأَيْتُ مِنْ نَاقِصَاتِ عَقْلٍ وَدِينٍ، أَغْلَبَ لِذِي لُبَ مِنْكُن»</p><p>(You curse a lot and you do not appreciate your mate. I have never seen those who have shortcoming in mind and religion controlling those who have sound minds, other than you.) She said, \"O Messenger of Allah! What is this shortcoming in mind and religion\" He said,</p><p>«أَمَّا نُقْصَانُ عَقْلِهَا، فَشَهَادَةُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ تَعْدِلُ شَهَادَةَ رَجُلٍ، فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الْعَقْلِ، وَتَمْكُثُ اللَّيَالِي لَا تُصَلِّي وَتُفْطِرُ فِي رَمَضَانَ، فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الدِّين»</p><p>(As for the shortcoming in her mind, the testimony of two women equals the testimony of one man, and this is the shortcoming in the mind. As for the shortcoming in the religion, woman remains for nights at a time when she does not pray and breaks the fast in Ramadan)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَآءِ</p><p>(such as you agree for witnesses) requires competency in the witnesses. Further, Allah's statement,</p><p>أَن تَضِلَّ إْحْدَاهُمَا</p><p>(so that if one of them errs) refers to the two women witnesses; whenever one of them forgets a part of the testimony,</p><p>فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(the other can remind her) meaning, the other woman's testimony mends the shortcoming of forgetfulness in the first woman.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ</p><p>(And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called) means, when people are called to be witnesses, they should agree, as Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas stated. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ</p><p>(Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him,</p><p>«أَمَّا نُقْصَانُ عَقْلِهَا، فَشَهَادَةُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ تَعْدِلُ شَهَادَةَ رَجُلٍ، فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الْعَقْلِ، وَتَمْكُثُ اللَّيَالِي لَا تُصَلِّي وَتُفْطِرُ فِي رَمَضَانَ، فَهَذَا نُقْصَانُ الدِّين»</p><p>(As for the shortcoming in her mind, the testimony of two women equals the testimony of one man, and this is the shortcoming in the mind. As for the shortcoming in the religion, woman remains for nights at a time when she does not pray and breaks the fast in Ramadan)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ الشُّهَدَآءِ</p><p>(such as you agree for witnesses) requires competency in the witnesses. Further, Allah's statement,</p><p>أَن تَضِلَّ إْحْدَاهُمَا</p><p>(so that if one of them errs) refers to the two women witnesses; whenever one of them forgets a part of the testimony,</p><p>فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا الاٍّخْرَى</p><p>(the other can remind her) meaning, the other woman's testimony mends the shortcoming of forgetfulness in the first woman.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ</p><p>(And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called) means, when people are called to be witnesses, they should agree, as Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas stated. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ</p><p>(Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write.)</p><p>Some say that this Ayah indicates that agreeing to become a witness is Fard Kifayah (required on at least a part of the Muslim Ummah). However, the majority of the scholars say that the Ayah,</p><p>وَلاَ يَأْبَ الشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ</p><p>(And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called) is referring to testifying to what the witnesses actually witnessed, thus befitting their description of being `witnesses'. Therefore, when the witness is called to testify to what he witnessed, he is required to give testimony, unless this obligation was already fulfilled, in which case such testimony becomes Fard Kifayah. Mujahid and Abu Mijlaz said, \"If you are called to be a witness, then you have the choice to agree. If you witnessed and were called to testify, then come forward.\" It was reported that Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the obligation includes both cases, agreeing to be a witness and testifying to what one witnessed.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ تَسْـَمُواْ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَى أَجَلِهِ</p><p>(You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or large, for its fixed term) perfects this direction from Allah by commanding that the debt be written, whether the amount is large or small. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَسْـَمُواْ</p><p>(You should not become weary) meaning, do not be discouraged against writing transactions and their terms, whether the amount involved is large or small. Allah's statement,</p><p>ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَـدَةِ وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ</p><p>(that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) means, writing transactions that will be fulfillled at a later date is more just with Allah meaning better and more convenient in order to preserve the terms of the contract. Therefore, recording such agreements helps the witnesses, when they see their handwriting - or signatures - later on and thus remember what they witnessed, for it is possible that the witnesses might forget what they witnessed.</p><p>وَأَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُواْ</p><p>(And more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) meaning, this helps repel any doubt. Since if you need to refer to the contract that you wrote and the doubt will end.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>إِلاَ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَـرَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلاَّ تَكْتُبُوهَا</p><p>(save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down) indicates that if the transaction will be fulfilled immediately, then there is no harm if it is not recorded.</p><p>As for requiring witnesses to be present in trading transactions, Allah said,</p><p>وَأَشْهِدُواْ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ</p><p>(But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. )</p><p>However, this command was abrogated by,</p><p>فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِى اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَـنَتَهُ</p><p>(Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).)</p><p>Or, it could be that having witnesses in such cases is only recommended and not obligatory, as evident from the Hadith that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari narrated which Imam Ahmad collected. `Umarah bin Khuzaymah Al-Ansari said that his uncle, who was among the Prophet's Companions, told him that the Prophet was making a deal for a horse with a bedouin man. The Prophet asked the bedouin to follow him so that he could pay him the price of the horse. The Prophet went ahead of the bedouin. The bedouin met several men who tried to buy his horse, not knowing if the Prophet was actually determined to buy it. Some people offered more money for the horse than the Prophet had. The bedouin man said to the Prophet , \"If you want to buy this horse, then buy it or I will sell it to someone else.\" When he heard the bedouin man's words, the Prophet stood up and said, \"Have I not bought that horse from you\" The bedouin said, \"By Allah! I have not sold it to you.\" The Prophet said, \"Rather, I did buy it from you.\" The people gathered around the Prophet and the Bedouin while they were disputing, and the bedouin said, \"Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse.\" Meanwhile, the Muslims who came said to the bedouin, \"Woe to you! The Prophet only says the truth.\" When Khuzaymah bin Thabit came and heard the dispute between the Prophet and the bedouin who was saying, \"Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse, \" Khuzaymah said, \"I bear witness that you sold him the horse.\" The Prophet said to Khuzaymah, \"What is the basis of your testimony\" Khuzaymah said, \"That I entrusted you, O Messenger of Allah!\" Therefore, the Messenger made Khuzaymah's testimony equal to the testimony of two men. This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa ®299؛. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلاَ شَهِيدٌ</p><p>(Let neither scribe nor witness suffer (or cause) any harm) also indicates that the scribe and the witness must not cause any harm, such as, when the scribe writes other than what he is being dictated, or the witness testifies to other than what he heard or conceals his testimony. This is the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah.\"</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَإِن تَفْعَلُواْ فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ</p><p>(But if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you) means, \"If you defy what you were commanded and commit what you were prohibited, then it is because of the sin that resides and remains with you; sin that you never release or rid yourselves from.\"</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(So have Taqwa of Allah) means, fear Him, remember His watch over you, implement His command and avoid what He prohibited,</p><p>وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p>(And Allah teaches you. ) Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>يِـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إَن تَتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَانًا</p><p>(O you who believe! If you have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you Furqan (a criterion to judge between right and wrong)) 8:29, and,</p><p>يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ اتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَءَامِنُواْ بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُوراً تَمْشُونَ بِهِ</p><p>(O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah, and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight)) 57:28.</p><p>Allah said;</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And Allah is the All-Knower of everything) stating that Allah has perfect knowledge in all matters and in their benefits or repercussions, and nothing escapes His perfect watch, for His knowledge encompasses everything in existence.</p>",
    "<h2>What is the `Mortgaging' Mentioned in the Ayah</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ</p><p>(And if you are on a journey) meaning, traveling and some of you borrowed some money to be paid at a later date,</p><p>وَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ كَاتِبًا</p><p>(and cannot find a scribe) who would record the debt for you. Ibn `Abbas said, \"And even if they find a scribe, but did not find paper, ink or pen.\" Then,</p><p>فَرِهَـنٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ</p><p>(let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging)) given to the creditor in lieu of writing the transaction. The Two Sahihs recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died while his shield was mortgaged with a Jew in return for thirty Wasq (approximately 180 kg) of barley, which the Prophet bought on credit as provisions for his household. In another narration, the Hadith stated that this Jew was among the Jews of Al-Madinah.</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِى اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَـنَتَهُ</p><p>(then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).)</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, with a sound chain of narration, that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"This Ayah abrogated what came before it (i.e. that which required recording the transaction and having witnesses present).\" Ash-Sha`bi said, \"If you trust each other, then there is no harm if you do not write the loan or have witnesses present.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ</p><p>(And let him have Taqwa of Allah) means, the debtor.</p><p>Imam Ahmad and the Sunan recorded that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«عَلَى الْيَدِ مَا أَخَذَتْ، حَتَّى تُؤَدِّيَه»</p><p>(The hand (of the debtor) will carry the burden of what it took until it gives it back.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ تَكْتُمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ</p><p>(And conceal not the evidence) means, do not hide it or refuse to announce it. Ibn `Abbas and other scholars said, \"False testimony is one of the worst of the major sins, and such is the case with hiding the true testimony. This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ ءَاثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ</p><p>(For he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful).</p><p>As-Suddi commented, \"Meaning he is a sinner in his heart.\"</p><p>This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلاَ نَكْتُمُ شَهَـدَةَ اللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ الاٌّثِمِينَ</p><p>(We shall not hide testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful) 5:106.</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ بِالْقِسْطِ شُهَدَآءِ للَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوِ الْوَلِدَيْنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيّاً أَوْ فَقَيراً فَاللَّهُ أَوْلَى بِهِمَا فَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ الْهَوَى أَن تَعْدِلُواْ وَإِن تَلْوُواْ أَوْ تُعْرِضُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً</p><p>(O you who believe!

So follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you avoid justice; and if you distort your witness or refuse to give it, verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do) 4:135 and in this Ayah 2:283 He said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَكْتُمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ ءَاثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(And conceal not the evidence, for he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. And Allah is All-Knower of what you do.)</p>",
    "<h2>Would the Servants be Accountable for What They Conceal in Their Hearts</h2><p>Allah states that His is the kingship of the heavens and earth and of what and whoever is on or between them, that He has perfect watch over them. No apparent matter or secret that the heart conceals is ever a secret to Him, however minor it is. Allah also states that He will hold His servants accountable for what they do and what they conceal in their hearts. In similar statements, Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ إِن تُخْفُواْ مَا فِى صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ اللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth.

In this Ayah 2:284, Allah states that He has knowledge of what the hearts conceal, and consequently, He will hold the creation accountable for whatever is in their hearts. This is why when this Ayah was revealed, it was hard on the Companions, since out of their strong faith and conviction, they were afraid that such reckoning would diminish their good deeds.</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"When</p><p>لِّلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَـوتِ وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُم بِهِ اللَّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p>(To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.

The Companions came to the Messenger and fell to their knees saying, `O Messenger of Allah! We were asked to perform what we can bear of deeds: the prayer, the fast, Jihad and charity. However, this Ayah was revealed to you, and we cannot bear it.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَتُرِيدُونَ أَنْ تَقُولُوا كَما قَالَ أَهْلُ الْكِتَابَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ: سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا؟ بَلْ قُولُوا: سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِير»</p><p>(Do you want to repeat what the People of the Two Scriptures before you said, that is, `We hear and we disobey' Rather, say, `We hear and we obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O our Lord, and the Return is to You.)</p><p>When the people accepted this statement and their tongues recited it, Allah sent down afterwards,</p><p>ءَامَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَـئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p>(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do)the believers.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«قُولُوا: سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا»</p><p>(Say, `We hear and we obey.') They said, `We hear and we obey.' Thereafter, this Ayah abrogated the previous Ayah,</p><p>ءَامَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ</p><p>(The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers.

The believers also believe in all Allah's Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah's Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah's leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad's Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p>(And they say, \"We hear, and we obey\") means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p><p>غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا</p><p>((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah's forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا</p><p>(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah's kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation.

    "<h2>The Mutashabihat and Muhkamat Ayat</h2><p>Allah states that in the Qur'an, there are Ayat that are Muhkamat, entirely clear and plain, and these are the foundations of the Book which are plain for everyone. And there are Ayat in the Qur'an that are Mutashabihat not entirely clear for many, or some people. So those who refer to the Muhkam Ayat to understand the Mutashabih Ayat, will have acquired the correct guidance, and vice versa. This is why Allah said,</p><p>هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(They are the foundations of the Book), meaning, they are the basis of the Qur'an, and should be referred to for clarification, when warranted,</p><p>وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(And others not entirely clear) as they have several meanings, some that agree with the Muhkam and some that carry other literal indications, although these meaning might not be desired.</p><p>The Muhkamat are the Ayat that explain the abrogating rulings, the allowed, prohibited, laws, limits, obligations and rulings that should be believed in and implemented. As for the Mutashabihat Ayat, they include the abrogated Ayat, parables, oaths, and what should be believed in, but not implemented.</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar commented on,</p><p>مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(In it are verses that are entirely clear) as \"Containing proof of the Lord, immunity for the servants and a refutation of opponents and of falsehood. They cannot be changed or altered from what they were meant for.\" He also said, \"As for the unclear Ayat, they can (but must not) be altered and changed, and this is a test from Allah to the servants, just as He tested them with the allowed and prohibited things. So these Ayat must not be altered to imply a false meaning or be distorted from the truth.\"</p><p>Therefore, Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ</p><p>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation) meaning, those who are misguided and deviate from truth to falsehood,</p><p>فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ</p><p>(they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof) meaning, they refer to the Mutashabih, because they are able to alter its meanings to conform with their false interpretation since the wordings of the Mutashabihat encompass such a wide area of meanings. As for the Muhkam Ayat, they cannot be altered because they are clear and, thus, constitute unequivocal proof against the misguided people. This is why Allah said,</p><p>ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ</p><p>(seeking Al-Fitnah) meaning, they seek to misguide their following by pretending to prove their innovation by relying on the Qur'an -- the Mutashabih of it -- but, this is proof against and not for them. For instance, Christians might claim that `Isa is divine because the Qur'an states that he is Ruhullah and His Word, which He gave to Mary, all the while ignoring Allah's statements,</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He `Isa was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.) 43:59, and,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: \"Be!\" and he was.) 3:59.</p><p>There are other Ayat that clearly assert that `Isa is but one of Allah's creatures and that he is the servant and Messenger of Allah ﷺ, among other Messengers.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>(And seeking for its Ta'wil,) to alter them as they desire. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear,), until,</p><p>أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(Men of understanding) and he said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِين يُجَادِلُونَ فِيهِ، فَهُمُ الَّذِينَ عَنَى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who argue in it (using the Mutashabihat), then they are those whom Allah meant. Therefore, beware of them.)\"</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah 3:7, as did Muslim in the book of Qadar (the Divine Will) in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud in the Sunnah section of his Sunan, from `A'ishah; \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear,) until,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)</p><p>He then said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتِ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ؛ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear of the Qur'an, then they are those whom Allah described, so beware of them.)\"</p><p>This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p><h2>Only Allah Knows the True Ta'wil (Interpretation) of the Mutashabihat</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(But none knows its Ta'wil except Allah.)</p><p>Similarly, as preceded in what has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Tafsir is of four types: Tafsir that the Arabs know in their language; Tafsir that no one is excused of being ignorant of; Tafsir that the scholars know; and Tafsir that only Allah knows.\" Scholars of Qur'an recitation have different opinions about pausing at Allah's Name in this Ayah. This stop was reported from `A'ishah, `Urwah, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' and Abu Nahik.</p><p>Some pause after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) saying that the Qur'an does not address the people with what they cannot understand. Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I am among those who are firmly grounded in its Ta'wil interpretation.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ supplicated for the benefit of Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ فَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ وَعَلِّمْهُ التَّأْوِيل»</p><p>(O Allah! Bestow on him knowledge in the religion and teach him the Ta'wil (interpretation).)</p><p>Ta'wil has two meanings in the Qur'an, the true reality of things, and what they will turn out to be. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(And he said: \"O my father! This is the Ta'wil of my dream aforetime!\".) 12:100, and,</p><p>هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ تَأْوِيلَهُ يَوْمَ يَأْتِى تَأْوِيلُهُ</p><p>(Await they just for it's Ta'wil On the Day (Day of Resurrection) it's Ta'wil is finally fulfillled.)(7:53) refers to the true reality of Resurrection that they were told about. If this is the meaning desired in the Ayah above 3:7, then pausing after reciting Allah's Name is warranted, because only Allah knows the true reality of things. In this case, Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is connected to His statement,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(say: \"We believe in it\") If the word Ta'wil means the second meaning, that is, explaining and describing, such as what Allah said,</p><p>نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>((They said): \"Inform us of the Ta'wil of this\") meaning its explanation, then pausing after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is warranted. This is because the scholars have general knowledge in, and understand what they were addressed with, even though they do not have knowledge of the true reality of things. Therefore, Allah's statement,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(say: \"We believe in it\") describes the conduct of the scholars. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَجَآءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفّاً صَفّاً</p><p>(And your Lord comes, and the angels, in rows.) 89:22 means, your Lord will come, and the angels will come in rows.</p><p>Allah's statement that the knowledgeable people proclaim,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(We believe in it) means, they believe in the Mutashabih.</p><p>كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا</p><p>(all of it is from our Lord) meaning, both the Muhkam and the Mutashabih are true and authentic, and each one of them testifies to the truth of the other. This is because they both are from Allah and nothing that comes from Allah is ever met by contradiction or discrepancy. Allah said,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ اخْتِلَـفاً كَثِيراً</p><p>(Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.) 4:82.</p><p>Allah said in his Ayah 3:7,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding. ) meaning, those who have good minds and sound comprehension, understand, contemplate and comprehend the meaning in the correct manner. Further, Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded in his Tafsir that Nafi` bin Yazid said, \"Those firmly grounded in knowledge are those who are modest for Allah's sake, humbly seek His pleasure, and do not exaggerate regarding those above them, or belittle those below them.\"</p><p>Allah said that they supplicate to their Lord,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا</p><p>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us.) meaning, \"Do not deviate our hearts from the guidance after You allowed them to acquire it. Do not make us like those who have wickedness in their hearts, those who follow the Mutashabih in the Qur'an. Rather, make us remain firmly on Your straight path and true religion.\"</p><p>وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ</p><p>(And grant us from Ladunka) meaning, from You,</p><p>رَحْمَةً</p><p>(Mercy) with which You make our hearts firm, and increase in our Faith and certainty,</p><p>إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(Truly, You are the Bestower)</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded that Umm Salamah said that the Prophet used to supplicate,</p><p>«يَا مُقَلِّبَ الْقُلُوبِ ثَبِّتْ قَلْبِي عَلَى دِينِك»</p><p>(O You Who changes the hearts, make my heart firm on Your religion.)</p><p>He then recited,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(\"Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You.

Verily, it is You Who will gather mankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt\") meaning, they say in their supplication: O our Lord! You will gather Your creation on the Day of Return, judge between them and decide over what they disputed about. Thereafter, You will reward or punish each according to the deeds they did in this life.</p>",
    "<h2>The Mutashabihat and Muhkamat Ayat</h2><p>Allah states that in the Qur'an, there are Ayat that are Muhkamat, entirely clear and plain, and these are the foundations of the Book which are plain for everyone. And there are Ayat in the Qur'an that are Mutashabihat not entirely clear for many, or some people. So those who refer to the Muhkam Ayat to understand the Mutashabih Ayat, will have acquired the correct guidance, and vice versa. This is why Allah said,</p><p>هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ</p><p>(They are the foundations of the Book), meaning, they are the basis of the Qur'an, and should be referred to for clarification, when warranted,</p><p>وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(And others not entirely clear) as they have several meanings, some that agree with the Muhkam and some that carry other literal indications, although these meaning might not be desired.</p><p>The Muhkamat are the Ayat that explain the abrogating rulings, the allowed, prohibited, laws, limits, obligations and rulings that should be believed in and implemented. As for the Mutashabihat Ayat, they include the abrogated Ayat, parables, oaths, and what should be believed in, but not implemented.</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar commented on,</p><p>مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(In it are verses that are entirely clear) as \"Containing proof of the Lord, immunity for the servants and a refutation of opponents and of falsehood. They cannot be changed or altered from what they were meant for.\" He also said, \"As for the unclear Ayat, they can (but must not) be altered and changed, and this is a test from Allah to the servants, just as He tested them with the allowed and prohibited things. So these Ayat must not be altered to imply a false meaning or be distorted from the truth.\"</p><p>Therefore, Allah said,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ</p><p>(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation) meaning, those who are misguided and deviate from truth to falsehood,</p><p>فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـبَهَ مِنْهُ</p><p>(they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof) meaning, they refer to the Mutashabih, because they are able to alter its meanings to conform with their false interpretation since the wordings of the Mutashabihat encompass such a wide area of meanings. As for the Muhkam Ayat, they cannot be altered because they are clear and, thus, constitute unequivocal proof against the misguided people. This is why Allah said,</p><p>ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ</p><p>(seeking Al-Fitnah) meaning, they seek to misguide their following by pretending to prove their innovation by relying on the Qur'an -- the Mutashabih of it -- but, this is proof against and not for them. For instance, Christians might claim that `Isa is divine because the Qur'an states that he is Ruhullah and His Word, which He gave to Mary, all the while ignoring Allah's statements,</p><p>إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(He `Isa was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.) 43:59, and,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: \"Be!\" and he was.) 3:59.</p><p>There are other Ayat that clearly assert that `Isa is but one of Allah's creatures and that he is the servant and Messenger of Allah ﷺ, among other Messengers.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>(And seeking for its Ta'wil,) to alter them as they desire. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَـبِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَـبِهَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book; and others not entirely clear,), until,</p><p>أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(Men of understanding) and he said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِين يُجَادِلُونَ فِيهِ، فَهُمُ الَّذِينَ عَنَى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who argue in it (using the Mutashabihat), then they are those whom Allah meant. Therefore, beware of them.)\"</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded a similar Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah 3:7, as did Muslim in the book of Qadar (the Divine Will) in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud in the Sunnah section of his Sunan, from `A'ishah; \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited this Ayah,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِى أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَـبَ مِنْهُ آيَـتٌ مُّحْكَمَـتٌ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are entirely clear,) until,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding.)</p><p>He then said,</p><p>«فَإِذَا رَأَيْتِ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ؛ فَأُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ، فَاحْذَرُوهُم»</p><p>(When you see those who follow what is not so clear of the Qur'an, then they are those whom Allah described, so beware of them.)\"</p><p>This is the wording recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p><h2>Only Allah Knows the True Ta'wil (Interpretation) of the Mutashabihat</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ</p><p>(But none knows its Ta'wil except Allah.)</p><p>Similarly, as preceded in what has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Tafsir is of four types: Tafsir that the Arabs know in their language; Tafsir that no one is excused of being ignorant of; Tafsir that the scholars know; and Tafsir that only Allah knows.\" Scholars of Qur'an recitation have different opinions about pausing at Allah's Name in this Ayah. This stop was reported from `A'ishah, `Urwah, Abu Ash-Sha`tha' and Abu Nahik.</p><p>Some pause after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) saying that the Qur'an does not address the people with what they cannot understand. Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"I am among those who are firmly grounded in its Ta'wil interpretation.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ supplicated for the benefit of Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ فَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ وَعَلِّمْهُ التَّأْوِيل»</p><p>(O Allah! Bestow on him knowledge in the religion and teach him the Ta'wil (interpretation).)</p><p>Ta'wil has two meanings in the Qur'an, the true reality of things, and what they will turn out to be. For instance, Allah said,</p><p>وَقَالَ يأَبَتِ هَـذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَـى مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(And he said: \"O my father! This is the Ta'wil of my dream aforetime!\".) 12:100, and,</p><p>هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ تَأْوِيلَهُ يَوْمَ يَأْتِى تَأْوِيلُهُ</p><p>(Await they just for it's Ta'wil On the Day (Day of Resurrection) it's Ta'wil is finally fulfillled.)(7:53) refers to the true reality of Resurrection that they were told about. If this is the meaning desired in the Ayah above 3:7, then pausing after reciting Allah's Name is warranted, because only Allah knows the true reality of things. In this case, Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is connected to His statement,</p><p>يَقُولُونَ ءَامَنَّا بِهِ</p><p>(say: \"We believe in it\") If the word Ta'wil means the second meaning, that is, explaining and describing, such as what Allah said,</p><p>نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p>((They said): \"Inform us of the Ta'wil of this\") meaning its explanation, then pausing after reciting,</p><p>وَالرَسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ</p><p>(And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge) is warranted.

Allah said,</p><p>أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْءَانَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ اخْتِلَـفاً كَثِيراً</p><p>(Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.) 4:82.</p><p>Allah said in his Ayah 3:7,</p><p>وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ الأَلْبَـبِ</p><p>(And none receive admonition except men of understanding. ) meaning, those who have good minds and sound comprehension, understand, contemplate and comprehend the meaning in the correct manner. Further, Ibn Al-Mundhir recorded in his Tafsir that Nafi` bin Yazid said, \"Those firmly grounded in knowledge are those who are modest for Allah's sake, humbly seek His pleasure, and do not exaggerate regarding those above them, or belittle those below them.\"</p><p>Allah said that they supplicate to their Lord,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا</p><p>(Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us.) meaning, \"Do not deviate our hearts from the guidance after You allowed them to acquire it. Do not make us like those who have wickedness in their hearts, those who follow the Mutashabih in the Qur'an. Rather, make us remain firmly on Your straight path and true religion.\"</p><p>وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ</p><p>(And grant us from Ladunka) meaning, from You,</p><p>رَحْمَةً</p><p>(Mercy) with which You make our hearts firm, and increase in our Faith and certainty,</p><p>إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(Truly, You are the Bestower)</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded that Umm Salamah said that the Prophet used to supplicate,</p><p>«يَا مُقَلِّبَ الْقُلُوبِ ثَبِّتْ قَلْبِي عَلَى دِينِك»</p><p>(O You Who changes the hearts, make my heart firm on Your religion.)</p><p>He then recited,</p><p>رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْوَهَّابُ</p><p>(\"Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.\") The Ayah continues,</p><p>رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ النَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p>(\"Our Lord! Verily, it is You Who will gather mankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt\") meaning, they say in their supplication: O our Lord! You will gather Your creation on the Day of Return, judge between them and decide over what they disputed about. Thereafter, You will reward or punish each according to the deeds they did in this life.</p>",

    "<h2>The True Value of This Earthly Life</h2><p>Allah mentions the delights that He put in this life for people, such as women and children, and He started with women, because the test with them is more tempting. For instance, the Sahih recorded that the Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا تَرَكْتُ بَعْدِي فِتْنَةً أَضَرَّ عَلَى الرِّجَالِ مِنَ النِّسَاء»</p><p>(I did not leave behind me a test more tempting to men than women.)</p><p>When one enjoys women for the purpose of having children and preserving his chastity, then he is encouraged to do so. There are many Hadiths that encourage getting married, such as,</p><p>«وَإِنَّ خَيْرَ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ مَنْ كَانَ أَكْثَرَهَا نِسَاء»</p><p>(Verily, the best members of this Ummah are those who have the most wives) He also said,</p><p>«الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ، وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِهَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَة»</p><p>(This life is a delight, and the best of its delight is a righteous wife)</p><p>The Prophet said in another Hadith,</p><p>«حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ النِّسَاءُ وَالطِّيبُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»</p><p>(I was made to like women and perfume, and the comfort of my eye is the prayer.)</p><p>`A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"Nothing was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than women, except horses,\" and in another narration, \"...than horses except women.\"</p><p>The desire to have children is sometimes for the purpose of pride and boasting, and as such, is a temptation. When the purpose for having children is to reproduce and increase the Ummah of Muhammad with those who worship Allah alone without partners, then it is encouraged and praised. A Hadith states,</p><p>«تَزَوَّجُوا الْوَدُودَ الْوَلُودَ، فَإِنِّي مُكَاثِرٌ بِكُمُ الْأُمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Marry the Wadud (kind) and Walud (fertile) woman, for I will compare your numbers to the rest of the nations on the Day of Resurrection.)</p><p>The desire of wealth sometimes results out of arrogance, and the desire to dominate the weak and control the poor, and this conduct is prohibited. Sometimes, the want for more money is for the purpose of spending it on acts of worship, being kind to the family, the relatives, and spending on various acts of righteousness and obedience; this behavior is praised and encouraged in the religion.</p><p>Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions about the amount of the Qintar, all of which indicate that the Qintar is a large amount of money, as Ad-Dahhak and other scholars said. Abu Hurayrah said \"The Qintar is twelve thousand Uwqiyah, each Uwqiyah is better than what is between the heavens and earth.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir .</p><p>The desire to have horses can be one of three types. Sometimes, owners of horses collect them to be used in the cause of Allah, and when warranted, they use their horses in battle. This type of owner shall be rewarded for this good action. Another type collects horses to boast, and out of enmity to the people of Islam, and this type earns a burden for his behavior. Another type collects horses to fulfill their needs and to collect their offspring, and they do not forget Allah's right due on their horses. This is why in this case, these horses provide a shield of sufficiency for their owner, as evident by a Hadith that we will mention, Allah willing, when we explain Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَعِدُّواْ لَهُمْ مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم مّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رّبَاطِ الْخَيْلِ</p><p>(And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war.) 8:60.</p><p>As for the Musawwamah horses, Ibn `Abbas said that they are the branded, beautiful horses. This is the same explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Abdullah bin Abza, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Abu Sinan and others. Makhul said the Musawwamah refers to the horse with a white spotted faced, and the horse with white feet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ مِنْ فَرَسٍ عَرَبِيَ إِلَّا يُؤْذَنُ لَهُ مَعَ كُلِّ فَجْرٍ يَدْعُو بِدَعْوَتَيْنِ يَقُولُ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ خَوَّلْتَنِي مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ، فَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ أَحَبِّ مَالِهِ وَأَهْلِهِ إِلَيْهِ أَوْ أَحَبَّ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ إِلَيْه»</p><p>(Every Arabian horse is allowed to have two supplications every dawn, and the horse supplicates, `O Allah! You made me subservient to the son of Adam. Therefore, make me among the dearest of his wealth and household to him, or, ...make me the dearest of his household and wealth to him.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمُ</p><p>(Cattle) means, camels, cows and sheep.</p><p>وَالْحَرْثِ</p><p>(And fertile land) meaning, the land that is used to farm and grow plants.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>ذَلِكَ مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(This is the pleasure of the present world's life) meaning, these are the delights of this life and its short lived joys,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَأَبِ</p><p>(But Allah has the excellent return with Him) meaning, the best destination and reward.</p><h2>The Reward of the Those Who Have Taqwa is Better Than All Joys of This World</h2><p>This is why Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذَلِكُمْ</p><p>(Say: \"Shall I inform you of things far better than those\")</p><p>This Ayah means, \"Say, O Muhammad, to the people, `Should I tell you about what is better than the delights and joys of this life that will soon perish\"' Allah informed them of what is better when He said,</p><p>لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَارُ</p><p>(For those who have Taqwa there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow) meaning, rivers run throughout it. These rivers carry various types of drinks: honey, milk, wine and water such that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined,</p><p>خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ</p><p>(Therein (is their) eternal (home)) meaning, they shall remain in it forever and ever and will not want to be removed from it.</p><p>وَأَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</p><p>(And Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)) meaning, from filth, dirt, harm, menstruation, post birth bleeding, and other things that affect women in this world.</p><p>وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And Allah will be pleased with them) meaning, Allah's pleasure will descend on them and He shall never be angry with them after that. This is why Allah said in in Surah Bara`ah,</p><p>وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ</p><p>(But the pleasure of Allah is greater) 9:72, meaning, greater than the eternal delight that He has granted them. Allah then said,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) servants) and, He gives each provisions according to what they deserve.</p>",
    "<h2>The True Value of This Earthly Life</h2><p>Allah mentions the delights that He put in this life for people, such as women and children, and He started with women, because the test with them is more tempting. For instance, the Sahih recorded that the Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَا تَرَكْتُ بَعْدِي فِتْنَةً أَضَرَّ عَلَى الرِّجَالِ مِنَ النِّسَاء»</p><p>(I did not leave behind me a test more tempting to men than women.)</p><p>When one enjoys women for the purpose of having children and preserving his chastity, then he is encouraged to do so. There are many Hadiths that encourage getting married, such as,</p><p>«وَإِنَّ خَيْرَ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ مَنْ كَانَ أَكْثَرَهَا نِسَاء»</p><p>(Verily, the best members of this Ummah are those who have the most wives) He also said,</p><p>«الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ، وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِهَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَة»</p><p>(This life is a delight, and the best of its delight is a righteous wife)</p><p>The Prophet said in another Hadith,</p><p>«حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ النِّسَاءُ وَالطِّيبُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاة»</p><p>(I was made to like women and perfume, and the comfort of my eye is the prayer.)</p><p>`A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"Nothing was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than women, except horses,\" and in another narration, \"...than horses except women.\"</p><p>The desire to have children is sometimes for the purpose of pride and boasting, and as such, is a temptation. When the purpose for having children is to reproduce and increase the Ummah of Muhammad with those who worship Allah alone without partners, then it is encouraged and praised. A Hadith states,</p><p>«تَزَوَّجُوا الْوَدُودَ الْوَلُودَ، فَإِنِّي مُكَاثِرٌ بِكُمُ الْأُمَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَة»</p><p>(Marry the Wadud (kind) and Walud (fertile) woman, for I will compare your numbers to the rest of the nations on the Day of Resurrection.)</p><p>The desire of wealth sometimes results out of arrogance, and the desire to dominate the weak and control the poor, and this conduct is prohibited. Sometimes, the want for more money is for the purpose of spending it on acts of worship, being kind to the family, the relatives, and spending on various acts of righteousness and obedience; this behavior is praised and encouraged in the religion.</p><p>Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions about the amount of the Qintar, all of which indicate that the Qintar is a large amount of money, as Ad-Dahhak and other scholars said. Abu Hurayrah said \"The Qintar is twelve thousand Uwqiyah, each Uwqiyah is better than what is between the heavens and earth.\" This was recorded by Ibn Jarir .</p><p>The desire to have horses can be one of three types. Sometimes, owners of horses collect them to be used in the cause of Allah, and when warranted, they use their horses in battle. This type of owner shall be rewarded for this good action. Another type collects horses to boast, and out of enmity to the people of Islam, and this type earns a burden for his behavior. Another type collects horses to fulfill their needs and to collect their offspring, and they do not forget Allah's right due on their horses. This is why in this case, these horses provide a shield of sufficiency for their owner, as evident by a Hadith that we will mention, Allah willing, when we explain Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأَعِدُّواْ لَهُمْ مَّا اسْتَطَعْتُم مّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رّبَاطِ الْخَيْلِ</p><p>(And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war.) 8:60.</p><p>As for the Musawwamah horses, Ibn `Abbas said that they are the branded, beautiful horses. This is the same explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Abdullah bin Abza, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Abu Sinan and others. Makhul said the Musawwamah refers to the horse with a white spotted faced, and the horse with white feet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَيْسَ مِنْ فَرَسٍ عَرَبِيَ إِلَّا يُؤْذَنُ لَهُ مَعَ كُلِّ فَجْرٍ يَدْعُو بِدَعْوَتَيْنِ يَقُولُ: اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ خَوَّلْتَنِي مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ، فَاجْعَلْنِي مِنْ أَحَبِّ مَالِهِ وَأَهْلِهِ إِلَيْهِ أَوْ أَحَبَّ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ إِلَيْه»</p><p>(Every Arabian horse is allowed to have two supplications every dawn, and the horse supplicates, `O Allah! You made me subservient to the son of Adam. Therefore, make me among the dearest of his wealth and household to him, or, ...make me the dearest of his household and wealth to him.)</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالاٌّنْعَـمُ</p><p>(Cattle) means, camels, cows and sheep.</p><p>وَالْحَرْثِ</p><p>(And fertile land) meaning, the land that is used to farm and grow plants.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>ذَلِكَ مَتَـعُ الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(This is the pleasure of the present world's life) meaning, these are the delights of this life and its short lived joys,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الْمَأَبِ</p><p>(But Allah has the excellent return with Him) meaning, the best destination and reward.</p><h2>The Reward of the Those Who Have Taqwa is Better Than All Joys of This World</h2><p>This is why Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذَلِكُمْ</p><p>(Say: \"Shall I inform you of things far better than those\")</p><p>This Ayah means, \"Say, O Muhammad, to the people, `Should I tell you about what is better than the delights and joys of this life that will soon perish\"' Allah informed them of what is better when He said,</p><p>لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّـتٌ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَارُ</p><p>(For those who have Taqwa there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow) meaning, rivers run throughout it. These rivers carry various types of drinks: honey, milk, wine and water such that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined,</p><p>خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ</p><p>(Therein (is their) eternal (home)) meaning, they shall remain in it forever and ever and will not want to be removed from it.</p><p>وَأَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</p><p>(And Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)) meaning, from filth, dirt, harm, menstruation, post birth bleeding, and other things that affect women in this world.</p><p>وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And Allah will be pleased with them) meaning, Allah's pleasure will descend on them and He shall never be angry with them after that. This is why Allah said in in Surah Bara`ah,</p><p>وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ</p><p>(But the pleasure of Allah is greater) 9:72, meaning, greater than the eternal delight that He has granted them. Allah then said,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</p><p>(And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) servants) and, He gives each provisions according to what they deserve.</p>",

This Ayah encourages thanking Allah for the favors He granted His Messenger and his Ummah. Allah transferred the prophethood from the Children of Israel to the Arab, Qurashi, Makkan, unlettered Prophet, the Final and Last of all Prophets and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to all mankind and Jinn. Allah endowed the Prophet with the best of qualities from the prophets before him. Allah also granted him extra qualities that no other Prophet or Messenger before him was endowed with, such as granting him (more) knowledge of Allah and His Law, knowledge of more of the matters of the past and the future, such as what will occur in the Hereafter. Allah allowed Muhammad's ﷺ Ummah to reach the eastern and western parts of the world and gave dominance to his religion and Law over all other religions and laws. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet until the Day of Judgment, and as long as the day and night succeed each other. This is why Allah said,</p><p>قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ</p><p>(Say: \"O Allah! Possessor of the power,\") meaning, You decide what You will concerning Your creation and You do what you will.

We have the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all of this, and We give the prophethood to whom We will.\" Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ</p><p>(Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) and,</p><p>انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ</p><p>(See how We prefer one above another (in this world)) 17: 21</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>تُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى الْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ</p><p>(You make the night enter into the day, and You make the day enter into the night) meaning, You take from the length of one of them and add it to the shortness of the other, so that they become equal, and take from the length of one of them and add it to the other so that they are not equal. This occurs throughout the seasons of the year: spring, summer, fall and winter. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَتُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الَمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ</p><p>(You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living.) means, You bring out the seed from the plant and the plant from the seed; the date from its seed and the date's seed from the date; the faithful from the disbeliever and the disbeliever from the faithful; the chicken from the egg and the egg from the chicken, etc.</p><p>وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</p><p>(And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.) meaning, You give whomever You will innumerable amounts of wealth while depriving others from it, out of wisdom, and justice.</p>",
    "<h2>Encouraging Gratitude</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) O Muhammad , while praising your Lord, thanking Him, relying in all matters upon Him and trusting in Him.</p><p>اللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ</p><p>(O Allah! Possessor of the power) meaning, all sovereignty is Yours,</p><p>تُؤْتِى الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ</p><p>(You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will.) meaning, You are the Giver, You are the Taker, it is Your will that occurs and whatever You do not will, does not occur. This Ayah encourages thanking Allah for the favors He granted His Messenger and his Ummah. Allah transferred the prophethood from the Children of Israel to the Arab, Qurashi, Makkan, unlettered Prophet, the Final and Last of all Prophets and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to all mankind and Jinn. Allah endowed the Prophet with the best of qualities from the prophets before him. Allah also granted him extra qualities that no other Prophet or Messenger before him was endowed with, such as granting him (more) knowledge of Allah and His Law, knowledge of more of the matters of the past and the future, such as what will occur in the Hereafter. Allah allowed Muhammad's ﷺ Ummah to reach the eastern and western parts of the world and gave dominance to his religion and Law over all other religions and laws. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet until the Day of Judgment, and as long as the day and night succeed each other. This is why Allah said,</p><p>قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَـلِكَ الْمُلْكِ</p><p>(Say: \"O Allah! Possessor of the power,\") meaning, You decide what You will concerning Your creation and You do what you will. Allah refutes those who thought that they could decide for Allah,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانُ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنَ الْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(And they say: \"Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Ta'if)\") 43:31.</p><p>Allah refuted them by saying,</p><p>أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّكَ</p><p>(Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord) 43:32, meaning, \"We decide for Our creation what We will, without resistance or hindrance by anyone. We have the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all of this, and We give the prophethood to whom We will.\" Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ</p><p>(Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) and,</p><p>انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ</p><p>(See how We prefer one above another (in this world)) 17: 21</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>تُولِجُ الَّيْلَ فِى الْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِى الَّيْلِ</p><p>(You make the night enter into the day, and You make the day enter into the night) meaning, You take from the length of one of them and add it to the shortness of the other, so that they become equal, and take from the length of one of them and add it to the other so that they are not equal. This occurs throughout the seasons of the year: spring, summer, fall and winter.

    "<h2>The Prohibition of Supporting the Disbelievers</h2><p>Allah prohibited His believing servants from becoming supporters of the disbelievers, or to take them as comrades with whom they develop friendships, rather than the believers. Allah warned against such behavior when He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَىْءٍ</div><p>(And whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way) meaning, whoever commits this act that Allah has prohibited, then Allah will discard him. Similarly, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّى وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ</div><p>(O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends, showing affection towards them), until,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْهُ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(And whosoever of you does that, then indeed he has gone astray from the straight path.) 60:1. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الْكَـفِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً </div><p>(O you who believe! Take not for friends disbelievers instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest proof against yourselves) 4:144, and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَـرَى أَوْلِيَآءَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</div><p>(O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as friends, they are but friends of each other. And whoever befriends them, then surely, he is one of them.) 5:51.</p><p>Allah said, after mentioning the fact that the faithful believers gave their support to the faithful believers among the Muhajirin, Ansar and Bedouins,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ إِلاَّ تَفْعَلُوهُ تَكُنْ فِتْنَةٌ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَفَسَادٌ كَبِيرٌ </div><p>(And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, (and) if you do not behave the same, there will be Fitnah and oppression on the earth, and a great mischief and corruption.) 8:73.</p><p>Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـةً</div><p>(unless you indeed fear a danger from them) meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. For instance, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said, \"We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.\" Al-Bukhari said that Al-Hasan said, \"The Tuqyah is allowed until the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ</div><p>(And Allah warns you against Himself.) meaning, He warns you against His anger and the severe torment He prepared for those who give their support to His enemies, and those who have enmity with His friends,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(And to Allah is the final return) meaning, the return is to Him and He will reward or punish each person according to their deeds.</p>",
    "<h2>Allah Knows What the Hearts Conceal</h2><p>Allah tells His servants that He knows the secrets and apparent matters and that nothing concerning them escapes His observation. Rather, His knowledge encompasses them in all conditions, time frames, days and instances. His knowledge encompasses all that is in heaven and earth, and nothing not even the weight of an atom, or what is smaller than that in the earth, seas and mountains, escapes His observation. Indeed,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(And Allah is able to do all things.) and His ability encompasses everything. This Ayah alerts Allah's servants that they should fear Him enough to not commit what He prohibits and dislikes, for He has perfect knowledge in all they do and is able to punish them promptly. And He gives respite to some of them, then He punishes them, and He is Swift and Mighty in taking account. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَرًا</div><p>(On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah brings the good and evil deeds before the servant, just as He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ </div><p>(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) 75:13.</p><p>When the servant sees his good deeds, he becomes happy and delighted. When he sees the evil deeds he committed, he becomes sad and angry. Then he will wish that he could disown his evil work and that a long distance separated it from him. He will also say to the devil who used to accompany him in this life, and who used to encourage him to do evil;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</div><p>(\"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts ـ a horrible companion (indeed)!) 43:38.</p><p>Allah then said, while threatening and warning,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ</div><p>(And Allah warns you against Himself) meaning, He warns you against His punishment. Allah then said, while bringing hope to His servants, so that they do not despair from His mercy or feel hopeless of His kindness,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</div><p>(And Allah is full of kindness with the servants)</p><p>Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Allah is so kind with them that He warns them against Himself.\" Others commented, \"He is merciful with His creation and likes for them to remain on His straight path and chosen religion, and to follow His honorable Messenger.\"</p>",

    "<h2>Allah's Love is Attained by Following the Messenger</h2><p>This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad . Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari`ah (Law) of Muhammad and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَد»</p><p>(Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected of him.)</p><p>This is why Allah said here,</p><p>قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِى يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): \"If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...\") meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, \"Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;</p><p>قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِى يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p>(Say (O Muhammad to mankind): \"If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...\"). \"</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p>(\"And forgive you your sins.

Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law. We will mention this fact when we explain the Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ</p><p>(And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets) 3:81, Allah willing.</p>",

    "<h2>The Chosen Ones Among the People of the Earth</h2><p>Allah states that He has chosen these households over the people of the earth. For instance, Allah chose Adam, created him with His Hand and blew life into him. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, taught him the names of everything and allowed him to dwell in Paradise, but then sent him down from it out of His wisdom. Allah chose Nuh and made him the first Messenger to the people of the earth, when the people worshipped idols and associated others with Allah in worship. Allah avenged the way Nuh was treated, for he kept calling his people day and night, in public and in secret, for a very long time. However, his calling them only made them shun him more, and this is when Nuh supplicated against them. So Allah caused them to drown, and none among them was saved, except those who followed the religion that Allah sent to Nuh. Allah also chose the household of Ibrahim, including the master of all mankind, and the Final Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him. Allah also chose the household of `Imran, the father of Marym bint `Imran, the mother of `Isa, peace be upon them. So `Isa is from the offspring of Ibrahim, as we will mention in the Tafsir of Surat Al-An`am, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.</p>",

    "<h2>The Story of Maryam's Birth</h2><p>The wife of `Imran mentioned here is the mother of Maryam, and her name is Hannah bint Faqudh. Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned that Hannah could not have children and that one day, she saw a bird feeding its chick. She wished she could have children and supplicated to Allah to grant her offspring. Allah accepted her supplication, and when her husband slept with her, she became pregnant. She vowed to make her child concentrate on worship and serving Bayt Al-Maqdis (the Masjid in Jerusalem), when she became aware that she was pregnant. She said,</p><p>رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.) meaning, You hear my supplication and You know my intention. She did not know then what she would give birth to, a male or a female.</p><p>فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ</p><p>(Then when she gave birth to her, she said: \"O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, ـ and Allah knew better what she bore.)</p><p>وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالاٍّنثَى</p><p>(And the male is not like the female,) in strength and the commitment to worship Allah and serve the Masjid in Jerusalem.</p><p>وَإِنِّى سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ</p><p>(And I have named her Maryam,) thus, testifying to the fact that it is allowed to give a name to the newly born the day it is born, as is apparent from the Ayah, which is also a part of the law of those who were before us. Further, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned that the Prophet said,</p><p>«وُلِدَ لِيَ اللَّيْلَةَ وَلَدٌ، سَمَّيْتُهُ بِاسْمِ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيم»</p><p>(This night, a son was born for me and I called him by my father's name, Ibrahim.)

    "<h2>The Story of Maryam's Birth</h2><p>The wife of `Imran mentioned here is the mother of Maryam, and her name is Hannah bint Faqudh. Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned that Hannah could not have children and that one day, she saw a bird feeding its chick. She wished she could have children and supplicated to Allah to grant her offspring. Allah accepted her supplication, and when her husband slept with her, she became pregnant. She vowed to make her child concentrate on worship and serving Bayt Al-Maqdis (the Masjid in Jerusalem), when she became aware that she was pregnant. She said,</p><p>رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p>(O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.) meaning, You hear my supplication and You know my intention. She did not know then what she would give birth to, a male or a female.</p><p>فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّى وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنثَى وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ</p><p>(Then when she gave birth to her, she said: \"O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, ـ and Allah knew better what she bore.)</p><p>وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالاٍّنثَى</p><p>(And the male is not like the female,) in strength and the commitment to worship Allah and serve the Masjid in Jerusalem.</p><p>وَإِنِّى سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ</p><p>(And I have named her Maryam,) thus, testifying to the fact that it is allowed to give a name to the newly born the day it is born, as is apparent from the Ayah, which is also a part of the law of those who were before us. Further, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned that the Prophet said,</p><p>«وُلِدَ لِيَ اللَّيْلَةَ وَلَدٌ، سَمَّيْتُهُ بِاسْمِ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيم»</p><p>(This night, a son was born for me and I called him by my father's name, Ibrahim.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p><p>They also recorded that Anas bin Malik brought his newborn brother to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who chewed a piece of date and put it in the child's mouth and called him `Abdullah. Other new born infants were also given names on the day they were born.</p><p>Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, that Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«كُلُّ غُلَامٍ رَهِينٌ بِعَقِيقَتِهِ، يُذْبَحُ عَنْهُ يَوْمَ سَابِعِهِ، وَيُسَمَّى وَيُحْلَقُ رَأَسُه»</p><p>(Every new born boy held in security by his `Aqiqah, until his seventh day, a sacrifice is offered on his behalf, he is given a name, and the hair on his head is shaved.)</p><p>This Hadith was collected by Ahmad and the collectors of the Sunan, and was graded Sahih by At-Tirmidhi.

    "<h2>Maryam Grows Up; Her Honor is with Allah</h2><p>Allah states that He has accepted Maryam as a result of her mother's vow and that He,</p><p>وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتًا حَسَنًا</p><p>(made her grow in a good manner) meaning, made her conduct becoming, her mannerism delightful and He made her well liked among people. He also made her accompany the righteous people, so that she learned righteousness, knowledge and religion.</p><p>وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا</p><p>(And put her under the care of Zakariyya) meaning, Allah made Zakariyya her sponsor. Allah made Zakariyya Maryam's guardian for her benefit, so that she would learn from his tremendous knowledge and righteous conduct. He was the husband of her maternal aunt, as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Jarir stated, or her brother-in-law, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p><p>«فَإِذَا بِيَحْيَى وَعِيسى، وَهُمَا ابْنَا الْخَالَة»</p><p>(I saw John and `Isa, who are maternal cousins.)</p><p>We should state that in general terms, what Ibn Ishaq said is plausible, and in this case, Maryam was under the care of her maternal aunt. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ decided that `Amarah, the daughter of Hamzah, be raised by her maternal aunt, the wife of Ja`far bin Abi Talib, saying,</p><p>«الْخَالَةُ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الْأُم»</p><p>(The maternal aunt is just like the mother.)</p><p>Allah then emphasizes Maryam's honor and virtue at the place of worship she attended,</p><p>كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا</p><p>(Every time he entered the Mihrab to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance.)</p><p>Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and As-Suddi said, \"He would find with her the fruits of the summer during winter, and the fruits of the winter during summer.\" When Zakariyya would see this; d</p><p>قَالَ يمَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هَـذَا</p><p>(He said: \"O Maryam! From where have you gotten this\") meaning, where did you get these fruits from</p><p>قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ إنَّ اللَّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</p><p>(She said, \"This is from Allah.\" Verily, Allah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Supplication of Zakariyya, and the Good News of Yahya's Birth</h2><p>When Zakariyya saw that Allah provided sustenance for Maryam by giving her the fruits of winter in summer and the fruits of summer in winter, he was eager to have a child of his own. By then, Zakariyya had become an old man, his bones feeble and his head full of gray hair. His wife was an old women who was barren.

    "<h2>The Description of `Isa and the Miracles He Performed</h2><p>Allah states that the good news brought to Maryam about `Isa was even better because Allah would teach him,</p><p>الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ</p><p>(the Book and Al-Hikmah). It appears that the `Book' the Ayah mentioned here refers to writing. We explained the meaning of Al-Hikmah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah.</p><p>التَّوْرَاةَ وَالإِنجِيلَ</p><p>(the Tawrah and the Injil). The Tawrah is the Book that Allah sent down to Musa, son of `Imran, while the Injil is what Allah sent down to `Isa, son of Maryam, peace be upon them, and `Isa memorized both Books. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَرَسُولاً إِلَى بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ</p><p>(And will make him a Messenger to the Children of Israel) means, that Allah will send `Isa as a Messenger to the Children of Israel, proclaiming to them,</p><p>أَنِّى قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِى أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah's leave). These are the miracles that `Isa performed; he used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow into it, and it became a bird by Allah's leave. Allah made this a miracle for `Isa to testify that He had sent him.</p><p>وَأُبْرِىءُ الاٌّكْمَهَ</p><p>(And I heal him who is Akmah) meaning, `a person who was born blind,' which perfects this miracle and makes the challenge more daring.</p><p>وَالاٌّبْرَصَ</p><p>(And the leper) which is a known disease,</p><p>وَأُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(And I bring the dead to life by Allah's leave).</p><p>Many scholars stated that Allah sent every Prophet with a miracle suitable to his time. For instance, in the time of Musa, magic was the trade of the time, and magicians held a high position. So Allah sent Musa with a miracle that captured the eyes and bewildered every magician. When the magicians realized that Musa's miracle came from the Almighty, Most Great, they embraced Islam and became pious believers. As for `Isa, he was sent during a time when medicine and knowledge in physics were advancing. `Isa brought them the types of miracles that could not be performed, except by one sent by Allah. How can any physician bring life to clay, cure blindness and leprosy and bring back to life those entrapped in the grave Muhammad ﷺ was sent during the time of eloquent people and proficient poets. He brought them a Book from Allah; if mankind and the Jinn tried to imitate ten chapters, or even one chapter of it, they will utterly fail in this task, even if they tried to do it by collective cooperation. This is because the Qur'an is the Word of Allah and is nothing like that of the creatures.</p><p>`Isa's statement,</p><p>وَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِى بُيُوتِكُمْ</p><p>(And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses) means, I tell you about what one of you has just eaten and what he is keeping in his house for tomorrow.</p><p>إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ</p><p>(Surely, therein), all these miracles,</p><p>لأَيَةً لَّكُمْ</p><p>(is a sign for you) testifying to the truth of what I was sent to you with,</p><p>إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَوَمُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ</p><p>(If you believe.

    "<h2>The Disciples Give Their Support to `Isa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>فَلَمَّآ أَحَسَّ عِيسَى</p><p>(Then when `Isa came to know), meaning, `Isa felt that they were adamant in disbelief and continuing in misguidance. He said to them,</p><p>مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p>(Who will be my helper in Allah's cause) Mujahid commented, \"Meaning, who would follow me to Allah\" However, it appears that `Isa was asking, \"Who would help me convey the Message of Allah ﷺ\"</p><p>The Prophet said during the Hajj season, before the Hijrah,</p><p>«مَنْ رَجُلٌ يُؤْوِينِي حَتَّى أُبَلِّغَ كَلَامَ رَبِّي؟، فَإِنَّ قُرَيْشًا قَدْ مَنَعُونِي أَنْ أُبَلِّغَ كَلَامَ رَبِّي»</p><p>(Who will give me asylum so that I can convey the Speech of my Lord, for the Quraysh have prevented me from conveying the Speech of my Lord.) until he found the Ansar.

This is similar to what happened with `Isa, for some of the Children of Israel believed in him, gave him their aid and support and followed the light that was sent with him. This is why Allah said about them;</p><p>فَلَمَّآ أَحَسَّ عِيسَى مِنْهُمُ الْكُفْرَ قَالَ مَنْ أَنصَارِى إِلَى اللَّهِ قَالَ الْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ اللَّهِ ءَامَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ - رَبَّنَآ ءَامَنَّا بِمَآ أَنزَلَتْ وَاتَّبَعْنَا الرَّسُولَ فَاكْتُبْنَا مَعَ الشَّـهِدِينَ</p><p>(Al-Hawariyyun said: \"We are the helpers of Allah; we believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims.

The Two Sahihs recorded that when the Prophet encouraged the people to fight during the battle of Al-Ahzab, Az-Zubayr came forward, and again, when the Prophet asked for fighters a second time.

They complained about him to the king who was a disbeliever. They claimed that `Isa was a man who misguided people, discouraged them from obeying the king, caused division, and separated between man and his own son. They also said other lies about `Isa, which they will carry on their necks, including accusing him of being an illegitimate son. The king became furious and sent his men to capture `Isa to torture and crucify him. When they surrounded `Isa's home and he thought that they would surely capture him, Allah saved him from them, raising him up from the house to heaven. Allah put the image of `Isa on a man who was in the house; when the unjust people went in the house while it was still dark, they thought that he was `Isa. They captured that man, humiliated and crucified him. They also placed thorns on his head. However, Allah deceived these people. He saved and raised His Prophet from them, leaving them in disarray in the darkness of their transgression, thinking that they had successfully achieved their goal. Allah made their hearts hard, and defiant of the truth, disgracing them in such disgrace that it will remain with them until the Day of Resurrection.

And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he `Isa will be a witness against them.) 4:156-159</p><p>`His death' refers to `Isa, and the Ayah means that the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, before `Isa dies. This will occur when `Isa comes back to this world before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain. By that time, all the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, for he will annul the Jizyah and he will only accept Islam from people. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ</p><p>(I will take you) is in reference to sleep, for Allah raised `Isa while he was asleep.</p><h2>Altering the Religion of `Isa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(And purify save you from those who disbelieve) by raising you to heaven,</p><p>وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ</p><p>(And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, till the Day of Resurrection)</p><p>This is what happened. When Allah raised `Isa to heaven, his followers divided into sects and groups. Some of them believed in what Allah sent `Isa as, a servant of Allah, His Messenger, and the son of His female-servant.</p><p>However, some of them went to the extreme over `Isa, believing that he was the son of Allah. Some of them said that `Isa was Allah Himself, while others said that he was one of a Trinity. Allah mentioned these false creeds in the Qur'an and refuted them. The Christians remained like this until the third century CE, when a Greek king called, Constantine, became a Christian for the purpose of destroying Christianity. Constantine was either a philosopher, or he was just plain ignorant. Constantine changed the religion of `Isa by adding to it and deleting from it. He established the rituals of Christianity and the so-called Great Trust, which is in fact the Great Treachery. He also allowed them to eat the meat of swine, changed the direction of the prayer that `Isa established to the east, built churches for `Isa, and added ten days to the fast as compensation for a sin that he committed, as claimed. So the religion of `Isa became the religion of Constantine, who built more then twelve thousand churches, temples and monasteries for the Christians as well as the city that bears his name, Constantinople (Istanbul). Throughout this time, the Christians had the upper hand and dominated the Jews. Allah aided them against the Jews because they used to be closer to the truth than the Jews, even though both groups were and still are disbelievers, may Allah's curse descend on them.</p><p>When Allah sent Muhammad , those who believed in him also believed in Allah, His Angels, Books and Messengers in the correct manner. So they were the true followers of every Prophet who came to earth. They believed in the unlettered Prophet , the Final Messenger and the master of all mankind, who called them to believe in the truth in its entirety. This is why they had more right to every Prophet than his own nation, especially those who claim to follow their Prophet's way and religion, yet change and alter his religion. Furthermore, Allah abrogated all the laws that were sent down to the Prophets with the Law He sent Muhammad with, which consists of the true religion that shall never change or be altered until the commencement of the Last Hour. Muhammad's religion shall always be dominant and victorious over all other religions. This is why Allah allowed Muslims to conquer the eastern and western parts of the world and the kingdoms of the earth. Furthermore, all countries submitted to them; they demolished Kisra (king of Persia) and destroyed the Czar, ridding them of their treasures and spending these treasures for Allah's sake. All this occurred just as their Prophet told them it would, when he conveyed Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدّلَنَّهُمْ مّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِى لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ بِى شَيْئاً</p><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they worship Me and do not associate anything with Me.) 24:55.</p><p>Therefore, Muslims are the true believers in `Isa. The Muslims then acquired Ash-Sham from the Christians, causing them to evacuate to Asia Minor, to their fortified city in Constantinople.

So there is no doubt in it. Similarly, Allah said in Surah Maryam;</p><p>ذلِكَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِى فِيهِ يَمْتُرُونَ - مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ إِذَا قَضَى أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Such is `Isa, son of Maryam.

Allah said in a similar Ayat,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَتَوَفَّـكُم بِالَّيْلِ</p><p>(It is He Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep).) 6:60, and,</p><p>اللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى الاٌّنفُسَ حِينَ مِوْتِـهَا وَالَّتِى لَمْ تَمُتْ فِى مَنَامِـهَا</p><p>(It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep.) 39:42.</p><p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite the following words when he would awaken;</p><p>«الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي أَحْيَانَا بَعْدَ مَا أَمَاتَنَا، وَإِلَيْهِ النُّشُور»</p><p>(All the thanks are due to Allah Who brought us back to life after He had caused us to die (sleep), and the Return is to Him).</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَى مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَـناً عَظِيماً وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ</p><p>(And because of their disbelief and allegations against Maryam and because of their saying \"We killed Al-Masih `Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah  ﷺ, ـ but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared that way to them) until,</p><p>وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلاَّ اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِيناً - بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>(For surely; they killed him not But Allah raised him up unto Himself.

And on the Day of Resurrection, he `Isa will be a witness against them.) 4:156-159</p><p>`His death' refers to `Isa, and the Ayah means that the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, before `Isa dies. This will occur when `Isa comes back to this world before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain. By that time, all the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, for he will annul the Jizyah and he will only accept Islam from people. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ</p><p>(I will take you) is in reference to sleep, for Allah raised `Isa while he was asleep.</p><h2>Altering the Religion of `Isa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(And purify save you from those who disbelieve) by raising you to heaven,</p><p>وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ</p><p>(And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, till the Day of Resurrection)</p><p>This is what happened. When Allah raised `Isa to heaven, his followers divided into sects and groups. Some of them believed in what Allah sent `Isa as, a servant of Allah, His Messenger, and the son of His female-servant.</p><p>However, some of them went to the extreme over `Isa, believing that he was the son of Allah. Some of them said that `Isa was Allah Himself, while others said that he was one of a Trinity. Allah mentioned these false creeds in the Qur'an and refuted them. The Christians remained like this until the third century CE, when a Greek king called, Constantine, became a Christian for the purpose of destroying Christianity. Constantine was either a philosopher, or he was just plain ignorant. Constantine changed the religion of `Isa by adding to it and deleting from it. He established the rituals of Christianity and the so-called Great Trust, which is in fact the Great Treachery. He also allowed them to eat the meat of swine, changed the direction of the prayer that `Isa established to the east, built churches for `Isa, and added ten days to the fast as compensation for a sin that he committed, as claimed. So the religion of `Isa became the religion of Constantine, who built more then twelve thousand churches, temples and monasteries for the Christians as well as the city that bears his name, Constantinople (Istanbul). Throughout this time, the Christians had the upper hand and dominated the Jews. Allah aided them against the Jews because they used to be closer to the truth than the Jews, even though both groups were and still are disbelievers, may Allah's curse descend on them.</p><p>When Allah sent Muhammad , those who believed in him also believed in Allah, His Angels, Books and Messengers in the correct manner. So they were the true followers of every Prophet who came to earth. They believed in the unlettered Prophet , the Final Messenger and the master of all mankind, who called them to believe in the truth in its entirety. This is why they had more right to every Prophet than his own nation, especially those who claim to follow their Prophet's way and religion, yet change and alter his religion. Furthermore, Allah abrogated all the laws that were sent down to the Prophets with the Law He sent Muhammad with, which consists of the true religion that shall never change or be altered until the commencement of the Last Hour. Muhammad's religion shall always be dominant and victorious over all other religions. This is why Allah allowed Muslims to conquer the eastern and western parts of the world and the kingdoms of the earth. Furthermore, all countries submitted to them; they demolished Kisra (king of Persia) and destroyed the Czar, ridding them of their treasures and spending these treasures for Allah's sake. All this occurred just as their Prophet told them it would, when he conveyed Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدّلَنَّهُمْ مّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِى لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ بِى شَيْئاً</p><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they worship Me and do not associate anything with Me.) 24:55.</p><p>Therefore, Muslims are the true believers in `Isa. The Muslims then acquired Ash-Sham from the Christians, causing them to evacuate to Asia Minor, to their fortified city in Constantinople. The Muslims will be above them until the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, he, Muhammad , who is truthful and who received the true news, has conveyed to Muslims that they will conquer Constantinople in the future, and seize its treasures.</p><h2>Threatening the Disbelievers with Torment in This Life and the Hereafter</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يعِيسَى إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَىَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ - فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection.

Allah said in a similar Ayat,</p><p>وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَتَوَفَّـكُم بِالَّيْلِ</p><p>(It is He Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep).) 6:60, and,</p><p>اللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى الاٌّنفُسَ حِينَ مِوْتِـهَا وَالَّتِى لَمْ تَمُتْ فِى مَنَامِـهَا</p><p>(It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep.) 39:42.</p><p>The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite the following words when he would awaken;</p><p>«الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي أَحْيَانَا بَعْدَ مَا أَمَاتَنَا، وَإِلَيْهِ النُّشُور»</p><p>(All the thanks are due to Allah Who brought us back to life after He had caused us to die (sleep), and the Return is to Him).</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَى مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَـناً عَظِيماً وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ</p><p>(And because of their disbelief and allegations against Maryam and because of their saying \"We killed Al-Masih `Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah  ﷺ, ـ but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared that way to them) until,</p><p>وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ لَفِى شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلاَّ اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِيناً - بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً</p><p>وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً</p><p>(For surely; they killed him not But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he `Isa will be a witness against them.) 4:156-159</p><p>`His death' refers to `Isa, and the Ayah means that the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, before `Isa dies. This will occur when `Isa comes back to this world before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain. By that time, all the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, for he will annul the Jizyah and he will only accept Islam from people. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,</p><p>إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ</p><p>(I will take you) is in reference to sleep, for Allah raised `Isa while he was asleep.</p><h2>Altering the Religion of `Isa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ</p><p>(And purify save you from those who disbelieve) by raising you to heaven,</p><p>وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ</p><p>(And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, till the Day of Resurrection)</p><p>This is what happened. When Allah raised `Isa to heaven, his followers divided into sects and groups. Some of them believed in what Allah sent `Isa as, a servant of Allah, His Messenger, and the son of His female-servant.</p><p>However, some of them went to the extreme over `Isa, believing that he was the son of Allah. Some of them said that `Isa was Allah Himself, while others said that he was one of a Trinity. Allah mentioned these false creeds in the Qur'an and refuted them. The Christians remained like this until the third century CE, when a Greek king called, Constantine, became a Christian for the purpose of destroying Christianity. Constantine was either a philosopher, or he was just plain ignorant. Constantine changed the religion of `Isa by adding to it and deleting from it. He established the rituals of Christianity and the so-called Great Trust, which is in fact the Great Treachery. He also allowed them to eat the meat of swine, changed the direction of the prayer that `Isa established to the east, built churches for `Isa, and added ten days to the fast as compensation for a sin that he committed, as claimed. So the religion of `Isa became the religion of Constantine, who built more then twelve thousand churches, temples and monasteries for the Christians as well as the city that bears his name, Constantinople (Istanbul). Throughout this time, the Christians had the upper hand and dominated the Jews. Allah aided them against the Jews because they used to be closer to the truth than the Jews, even though both groups were and still are disbelievers, may Allah's curse descend on them.</p><p>When Allah sent Muhammad , those who believed in him also believed in Allah, His Angels, Books and Messengers in the correct manner. So they were the true followers of every Prophet who came to earth. They believed in the unlettered Prophet , the Final Messenger and the master of all mankind, who called them to believe in the truth in its entirety. This is why they had more right to every Prophet than his own nation, especially those who claim to follow their Prophet's way and religion, yet change and alter his religion. Furthermore, Allah abrogated all the laws that were sent down to the Prophets with the Law He sent Muhammad with, which consists of the true religion that shall never change or be altered until the commencement of the Last Hour. Muhammad's religion shall always be dominant and victorious over all other religions. This is why Allah allowed Muslims to conquer the eastern and western parts of the world and the kingdoms of the earth. Furthermore, all countries submitted to them; they demolished Kisra (king of Persia) and destroyed the Czar, ridding them of their treasures and spending these treasures for Allah's sake. All this occurred just as their Prophet told them it would, when he conveyed Allah's statement,</p><p>وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِى الاْرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِى ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدّلَنَّهُمْ مّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِى لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ بِى شَيْئاً</p><p>(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they worship Me and do not associate anything with Me.) 24:55.</p><p>Therefore, Muslims are the true believers in `Isa. The Muslims then acquired Ash-Sham from the Christians, causing them to evacuate to Asia Minor, to their fortified city in Constantinople. The Muslims will be above them until the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, he, Muhammad , who is truthful and who received the true news, has conveyed to Muslims that they will conquer Constantinople in the future, and seize its treasures.</p><h2>Threatening the Disbelievers with Torment in This Life and the Hereafter</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يعِيسَى إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَىَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَجَاعِلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ - فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</p><p>(And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection. Then you will return to Me and I will judge between you in the matters in which you used to dispute. As to those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe torment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.)</p><p>This is what Allah did to the Jews who disbelieved in `Isa and the Christians who went to the extreme over him. Allah tormented them in this life; they were killed, captured, and lost their wealth and kingdoms. Their torment in the Hereafter is even worse and more severe,</p><p>وَمَا لَهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ</p><p>(And they have no Waq (defender or protector) against Allah) 13:34.</p><p>وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ</p><p>(And as for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, Allah will pay them their reward in full) in this life, with victory and domination, and in the Hereafter, with Paradise and high grades,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ الظَّـلِمِينَ</p><p>(And Allah does not like the wrongdoers.)</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>ذَلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الآيَـتِ وَالذِّكْرِ الْحَكِيمِ</p><p>(This is what We recite to you of the verses and the Wise Reminder.) meaning, \"What We narrated to you, O Muhammd, regarding `Isa, his birth and his life, is what Allah conveyed and revealed to you, sent down from the Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet). So there is no doubt in it. Similarly, Allah said in Surah Maryam;</p><p>ذلِكَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ الْحَقِّ الَّذِى فِيهِ يَمْتُرُونَ - مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَـنَهُ إِذَا قَضَى أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(Such is `Isa, son of Maryam. (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute). It befits not Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He. When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" and it is.)</p>",
    "<h2>The Similarities Between the Creation of Adam and the Creation of `Isa</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَى عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah) regarding Allah's ability, since He created him without a father,</p><p>كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ</p><p>(is the likeness of Adam), for Allah created Adam without a father or a mother. Rather,</p><p>خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p>(He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: \"Be!\" and he was.)</p><p>Therefore, He Who created Adam without a father or a mother is able to create `Isa, as well, without a father. If the claim is made that `Isa is Allah's son because he was created without a father, then the same claim befits Adam even more. However, since such a claim regarding Adam is obviously false, then making the same claim about `Isa is even more false.</p><p>Furthermore, by mentioning these facts, Allah emphasizes His ability, by creating Adam without a male or female, Hawa' from a male without a female, and `Isa from a mother without a father, compared to His creating the rest of creation from male and female. This is why Allah said in Surah Maryam,</p><p>وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</p><p>(And We made him a sign for mankind) 19: 21.</p><p>Allah said in this Ayah,</p><p>الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) meaning, this is the only true story about `Isa, and what is beyond truth save falsehood Allah next commands His Messenger to call those who defy the truth, regarding `Isa, to the Mubahalah (the curse).</p><h2>The Challenge to the Mubahalah</h2><p>فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ</p><p>(Then whoever disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge that has come to you, say: \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves\") for the Mubahalah,</p><p>ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ</p><p>(then we pray), supplicate,</p><p>فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ</p><p>(and we invoke Allah's curse upon the liars) among the two of us.</p><p>The reason for the call to Mubahalah and the revelation of the Ayat from the beginning of this Surah until here, is that a delegation from the Christians of Najran (in Yemen) came to Al-Madinah to argue about `Isa, claiming that he was divine and the son of Allah. Allah sent down the beginning of this Surah until here, to refute their claims, as Imam Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar and other scholars stated.</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his famous Sirah, \"The delegation of Christians from Najran came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . The delegation consisted of sixty horsemen, including fourteen of their chiefs who make decisions. These men were Al-`Aqib, also known as `Abdul-Masih, As-Sayyid, also known as Al-Ayham, Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah, of the family of Bakr bin Wa`il and Uways bin Al-Harith. They also included, Zayd, Qays, Yazid, Nabih, Khuwaylid, `Amr, Khalid, `Abdullah and Yuhannas. Three of these men were chiefs of this delegation, Al-`Aqib, their leader and to whom they referred for advice and decision; As-Sayyid, their scholar and leader in journeys and social gatherings; and Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah, their patriarch, priest and religious leader. Abu Harithah was an Arab man from the family of Bakr bin Wa`il, but when he embraced Christianity, the Romans and their kings honored him and built churches for him (or in his honor). They also supported him financially and gave him servants, because they knew how firm his faith in their religion was.\" Abu Harithah knew the description of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ from what he read in earlier divine Books. However, his otherwise ignorance led him to insist on remaining a Christian, because he was honored and had a high position with the Christians. Ibn Ishaq said, \"Muhammad bin Ja`far bin Az-Zubayr said that, `The (Najran) delegation came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Al-Madinah, entered his Masjid wearing robes and garments, after the Prophet had prayed the `Asr prayer. They accompanied a caravan of camels led by Bani Al-Harith bin Ka`b. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who saw them said that they never saw a delegation like them after that... Then Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah and Al-`Aqib `Abdul-Masih or As-Sayyid Al-Ayham spoke to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and they were Christians like the king (Roman King). However, they disagreed about `Isa; some of them said, `He is Allah,' while some said, `He is the son of Allah,' and some others said, `He is one of a trinity.' Allah is far from what they attribute to Him.\"</p><p>Indeed, these are the creeds of the Christians. They claim that `Isa is God, since he brought the dead back to life, healed blindness, leprosy and various illnesses, told about matters of the future, created the shape of birds and blew life into them, bringing them to life. However, all these miracles occurred by Allah's leave, so that `Isa would be a sign from Allah for people.</p><p>They also claim that `Isa is the son of Allah, since he did not have a father and he spoke when he was in the cradle, a miracle which had not occurred by any among the Children of Adam before him, so they claim. They also claim that `Isa is one of a trinity, because Allah would say, `We did, command, create and demand.' They said, `If Allah were one, he would have said, `I did, command, create and decide.' This is why they claim that `Isa and Allah are one (Trinity). Allah is far from what they attribute to Him, and we should mention that the Qur'an refuted all these false Christian claims.</p><p>Ibn Ishaq continued, \"When these Ayat came to the Messenger from Allah ﷺ, thus judging between him and the People of the Book, Allah also commanded the Prophet to call them to the Mubahalah if they still refused the truth. The Prophet called them to the Mubahalah. They said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! Let us think about this matter and get back to you with our decision to what we want to do.' They left the Prophet and conferred with Al-`Aqib, to whom they referred to for advice. They said to him, `O `Abdul-Masih! What is your advice' He said, `By Allah, O Christian fellows! You know that Muhammad is a Messenger and that he brought you the final word regarding your fellow (`Isa). You also know that no Prophet conducted Mubahalah with any people, and the old persons among them remained safe and the young people grew up. Indeed, it will be the end of you if you do it. If you have already decided that you will remain in your religion and your creed regarding your fellow (`Isa), then conduct a treaty with the man (Muhammad) and go back to your land.' They came to the Prophet and said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! We decided that we cannot do Mubahalah with you and that you remain on your religion, while we remain on our religion. However, send with us a man from your Companions whom you are pleased with to judge between us regarding our monetary disputes, for you are acceptable to us in this regard.\"'</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Hudhayfah said, \"Al-`Aqib and As-Sayyid, two leaders from Najran, came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ seeking to invoke Allah for curses (against whoever is unjust among them), and one of them said to the other, `Let us not do that. By Allah, if he were truly a Prophet and we invoke Allah for curses, we and our offspring shall never succeed afterwards.' So they said, `We will give you what you asked and send a trusted man with us, just a trusted man.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«لَأَبْعَثَنَّ مَعَكُمْ رَجُلًا أَمِينًا حَقَّ أَمِين»</p><p>فاستشرف لها أصحاب رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم، فقال:</p><p>«قُمْ يَا أَبَا عُبَيْدَةَ بْنَ الْجَرَّاح»</p><p>فلما قام، قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم:</p><p>«هَذَا أَمِينُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّة»</p><p>(\"Verily, I will send a trusted man with you, a truly trustworthy man.\" The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ all felt eager to be that man. The Messenger said, \"O Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah! Stand up.\" When Abu `Ubaydah stood up, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"This is the trustee of this Ummah.\"')</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on another occasion,</p><p>«لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَمِينٌ، وَأَمِينُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ أَبُو عُبَيْدَةَ بْنُ الْجَرَّاح»</p><p>(Every Ummah has a trustee, and the trustee of this Ummah is Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, `If I see Muhammad praying next to the Ka`bah, I will step on his neck.' The Prophet later said,</p><p>«لَوْ فَعَلَ لَأَخَذَتْهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِيَانًا، ولو أن اليهود تمنوا الموت لماتوا، ورأوا مقاعدهم من النار، ولو خرج الذين يباهلون رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم لرجعوا لا يجدون مالًا ولا أهلًا»</p><p>(Had he tried to do it, the angels would have taken him publicly. Had the Jews wished for death, they would have perished and would have seen their seats in the Fire. Had those who sought Mubahalah with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, went ahead with it, they would not have found estates or families when they returned home).\" Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi graded Hasan Sahih.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْقَصَصُ الْحَقُّ</p><p>(Verily, this is the true narrative) meaning, what we narrated to you, O Muhammad, about `Isa is the plain truth that cannot be avoided,</p><p>وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُفَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ</p><p>(and none has the right to be worshipped but Allah.

They also included, Zayd, Qays, Yazid, Nabih, Khuwaylid, `Amr, Khalid, `Abdullah and Yuhannas. Three of these men were chiefs of this delegation, Al-`Aqib, their leader and to whom they referred for advice and decision; As-Sayyid, their scholar and leader in journeys and social gatherings; and Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah, their patriarch, priest and religious leader. Abu Harithah was an Arab man from the family of Bakr bin Wa`il, but when he embraced Christianity, the Romans and their kings honored him and built churches for him (or in his honor). They also supported him financially and gave him servants, because they knew how firm his faith in their religion was.\" Abu Harithah knew the description of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ from what he read in earlier divine Books. However, his otherwise ignorance led him to insist on remaining a Christian, because he was honored and had a high position with the Christians. Ibn Ishaq said, \"Muhammad bin Ja`far bin Az-Zubayr said that, `The (Najran) delegation came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Al-Madinah, entered his Masjid wearing robes and garments, after the Prophet had prayed the `Asr prayer.

They claim that `Isa is God, since he brought the dead back to life, healed blindness, leprosy and various illnesses, told about matters of the future, created the shape of birds and blew life into them, bringing them to life. However, all these miracles occurred by Allah's leave, so that `Isa would be a sign from Allah for people.</p><p>They also claim that `Isa is the son of Allah, since he did not have a father and he spoke when he was in the cradle, a miracle which had not occurred by any among the Children of Adam before him, so they claim. They also claim that `Isa is one of a trinity, because Allah would say, `We did, command, create and demand.' They said, `If Allah were one, he would have said, `I did, command, create and decide.'

This is why Allah said in Surah Maryam,</p><p>وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ ءَايَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ</p><p>(And We made him a sign for mankind) 19: 21.</p><p>Allah said in this Ayah,</p><p>الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) meaning, this is the only true story about `Isa, and what is beyond truth save falsehood Allah next commands His Messenger to call those who defy the truth, regarding `Isa, to the Mubahalah (the curse).</p><h2>The Challenge to the Mubahalah</h2><p>فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وأَنفُسَكُمْ</p><p>(Then whoever disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge that has come to you, say: \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves\") for the Mubahalah,</p><p>ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ</p><p>(then we pray), supplicate,</p><p>فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَـذِبِينَ</p><p>(and we invoke Allah's curse upon the liars) among the two of us.</p><p>The reason for the call to Mubahalah and the revelation of the Ayat from the beginning of this Surah until here, is that a delegation from the Christians of Najran (in Yemen) came to Al-Madinah to argue about `Isa, claiming that he was divine and the son of Allah. Allah sent down the beginning of this Surah until here, to refute their claims, as Imam Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar and other scholars stated.</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said in his famous Sirah, \"The delegation of Christians from Najran came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ . The delegation consisted of sixty horsemen, including fourteen of their chiefs who make decisions. These men were Al-`Aqib, also known as `Abdul-Masih, As-Sayyid, also known as Al-Ayham, Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah, of the family of Bakr bin Wa`il and Uways bin Al-Harith. They also included, Zayd, Qays, Yazid, Nabih, Khuwaylid, `Amr, Khalid, `Abdullah and Yuhannas. Three of these men were chiefs of this delegation, Al-`Aqib, their leader and to whom they referred for advice and decision; As-Sayyid, their scholar and leader in journeys and social gatherings; and Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah, their patriarch, priest and religious leader. Abu Harithah was an Arab man from the family of Bakr bin Wa`il, but when he embraced Christianity, the Romans and their kings honored him and built churches for him (or in his honor). They also supported him financially and gave him servants, because they knew how firm his faith in their religion was.\" Abu Harithah knew the description of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ from what he read in earlier divine Books. However, his otherwise ignorance led him to insist on remaining a Christian, because he was honored and had a high position with the Christians. Ibn Ishaq said, \"Muhammad bin Ja`far bin Az-Zubayr said that, `The (Najran) delegation came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Al-Madinah, entered his Masjid wearing robes and garments, after the Prophet had prayed the `Asr prayer. They accompanied a caravan of camels led by Bani Al-Harith bin Ka`b. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who saw them said that they never saw a delegation like them after that... Then Abu Harithah bin `Alqamah and Al-`Aqib `Abdul-Masih or As-Sayyid Al-Ayham spoke to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and they were Christians like the king (Roman King). However, they disagreed about `Isa; some of them said, `He is Allah,' while some said, `He is the son of Allah,' and some others said, `He is one of a trinity.' Allah is far from what they attribute to Him.\"</p><p>Indeed, these are the creeds of the Christians. They claim that `Isa is God, since he brought the dead back to life, healed blindness, leprosy and various illnesses, told about matters of the future, created the shape of birds and blew life into them, bringing them to life. However, all these miracles occurred by Allah's leave, so that `Isa would be a sign from Allah for people.</p><p>They also claim that `Isa is the son of Allah, since he did not have a father and he spoke when he was in the cradle, a miracle which had not occurred by any among the Children of Adam before him, so they claim. They also claim that `Isa is one of a trinity, because Allah would say, `We did, command, create and demand.' They said, `If Allah were one, he would have said, `I did, command, create and decide.' This is why they claim that `Isa and Allah are one (Trinity). Allah is far from what they attribute to Him, and we should mention that the Qur'an refuted all these false Christian claims.</p><p>Ibn Ishaq continued, \"When these Ayat came to the Messenger from Allah ﷺ, thus judging between him and the People of the Book, Allah also commanded the Prophet to call them to the Mubahalah if they still refused the truth. The Prophet called them to the Mubahalah. They said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! Let us think about this matter and get back to you with our decision to what we want to do.' They left the Prophet and conferred with Al-`Aqib, to whom they referred to for advice. They said to him, `O `Abdul-Masih! What is your advice' He said, `By Allah, O Christian fellows! You know that Muhammad is a Messenger and that he brought you the final word regarding your fellow (`Isa). You also know that no Prophet conducted Mubahalah with any people, and the old persons among them remained safe and the young people grew up. Indeed, it will be the end of you if you do it. If you have already decided that you will remain in your religion and your creed regarding your fellow (`Isa), then conduct a treaty with the man (Muhammad) and go back to your land.' They came to the Prophet and said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! We decided that we cannot do Mubahalah with you and that you remain on your religion, while we remain on our religion. However, send with us a man from your Companions whom you are pleased with to judge between us regarding our monetary disputes, for you are acceptable to us in this regard.\"'</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Hudhayfah said, \"Al-`Aqib and As-Sayyid, two leaders from Najran, came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ seeking to invoke Allah for curses (against whoever is unjust among them), and one of them said to the other, `Let us not do that. By Allah, if he were truly a Prophet and we invoke Allah for curses, we and our offspring shall never succeed afterwards.' So they said, `We will give you what you asked and send a trusted man with us, just a trusted man.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«لَأَبْعَثَنَّ مَعَكُمْ رَجُلًا أَمِينًا حَقَّ أَمِين»</p><p>فاستشرف لها أصحاب رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم، فقال:</p><p>«قُمْ يَا أَبَا عُبَيْدَةَ بْنَ الْجَرَّاح»</p><p>فلما قام، قال رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم:</p><p>«هَذَا أَمِينُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّة»</p><p>(\"Verily, I will send a trusted man with you, a truly trustworthy man.\" The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ all felt eager to be that man. The Messenger said, \"O Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah! Stand up.\" When Abu `Ubaydah stood up, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"This is the trustee of this Ummah.\"')</p><p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on another occasion,</p><p>«لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَمِينٌ، وَأَمِينُ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ أَبُو عُبَيْدَةَ بْنُ الْجَرَّاح»</p><p>(Every Ummah has a trustee, and the trustee of this Ummah is Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah.)</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, `If I see Muhammad praying next to the Ka`bah, I will step on his neck.' The Prophet later said,</p><p>«لَوْ فَعَلَ لَأَخَذَتْهُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِيَانًا، ولو أن اليهود تمنوا الموت لماتوا، ورأوا مقاعدهم من النار، ولو خرج الذين يباهلون رسول اللهصلى الله عليه وسلّم لرجعوا لا يجدون مالًا ولا أهلًا»</p><p>(Had he tried to do it, the angels would have taken him publicly. Had the Jews wished for death, they would have perished and would have seen their seats in the Fire. Had those who sought Mubahalah with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, went ahead with it, they would not have found estates or families when they returned home).\" Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi graded Hasan Sahih.</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>إِنَّ هَـذَا لَهُوَ الْقَصَصُ الْحَقُّ</p><p>(Verily, this is the true narrative) meaning, what we narrated to you, O Muhammad, about `Isa is the plain truth that cannot be avoided,</p><p>وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُفَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ</p><p>(and none has the right to be worshipped but Allah. And indeed, Allah is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. And if they turn away,) by abandoning this truth,</p><p>فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِالْمُفْسِدِينَ</p><p>(then surely, Allah is All-Aware of those who do mischief.) for those who abandon the truth for falsehood commit mischief, and Allah has full knowledge of them and will subject them to the worst punishment. Verily, Allah is able to control everything, all praise and thanks are due to Him, and we seek refuge with Him from His revenge.</p>",
    "<h2>Every Person Knows about Tawhid</h2><p>This Ayah includes the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians, and those who follow their ways.</p><p>قُلْ يأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَى كَلِمَةٍ</p><p>(Say: \"O people of the Scripture! Come to a word\")</p><p>`Word' - in Arabic - also means a complete sentence, as evident from this Ayah. Allah described this word as being one,</p><p>سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ</p><p>(that is the same between us and you), an honest and righteous word that is fair to both parties. Allah then explained this word,</p><p>أَلاَّ نَعْبُدَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ وَلاَ نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئاً</p><p>(that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him,) we worship neither a statue, cross, idol, Taghut (false gods), fire or anything else. Rather, we worship Allah Alone without partners, and this is the message of all of Allah's Messengers. Allah said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ</p><p>(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): \"None has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (Alone and none else).\") 21:25 and,</p><p>وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ</p><p>(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities).\") 16:36. Allah said next,</p><p>وَلاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(\"and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.\") Ibn Jurayj commented, \"We do not obey each other in disobedience to Allah.\"</p><p>فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُولُواْ اشْهَدُواْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</p><p>(Then, if they turn away, say: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims.\") if they abandon this fair call, then let them know that you will remain in Islam as Allah has legislated for you.</p><p>We should mention that the letter that the Prophet sent to Heraclius reads, \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, to Heraclius, Leader of the Romans: peace be upon those who follow the true guidance. Embrace Islam and you will acquire safety, embrace Islam and Allah will grant you a double reward. However, if you turn away from it, then you will carry the burden of the peasants, and,</p><p>يأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَى كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلاَّ نَعْبُدَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ وَلاَ نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضًا أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُولُواْ اشْهَدُواْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ</p><p>(\"O people of the Scripture: Come to a word that is the same between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.\" Then, if they turn away, say: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims.\")\"</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq and other scholars said that the beginning of Surah Al `Imran, and more than eighty verses thereafter; were revealed about the delegation of Najran. Az-Zuhri stated that the people of Najran were the first people to pay the Jizyah (tax money paid to the Muslim State). However, there is no disagreement that the Ayah that ordained the Jizyah 9:29 was revealed after the Fath (conquering Makkah, and therefore, after the delegation of Najran came to Al-Madinah). So, how can this Ayah 3:64 be contained in the Prophet's letter to Heraclius before the victory of Makkah, and how can we harmonize between the statements of Muhammad bin Ishaq and Az-Zuhri The answer is that the delegation of Najran came before Al-Hudaybiyyah (before the victory of Makkah), and what they paid was in lieu of the Mubahalah; not as Jizyah. The Ayah about the Jizyah was later revealed, and its ruling supported what occurred with the Najran people. In support of this opinion, we should mention that in another instance, the ruling on dividing the booty into one - fifth (for the Prophet ) and four-fifths (for the fighters) agreed with the practice of `Abdullah bin Jahsh during the raid that he led before Badr. An Ayah later on upheld the way `Abdullah divided the booty. Therefore, it is possible that the Prophet wrote this statement (Say, \"O People of the Scripture. ..\") in his letter to Heraclius before the Ayah was revealed. Later on, the Qur'an agreed with the Prophet's statement, word by word. It is also a fact that the Qur'an was revealed in agreement with what `Umar said regarding the captured disbelievers at Badr, the Hijab (Muslim woman code of dress), refraining from performing prayer for the hypocrites, and regarding his statements:</p><p>وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى</p><p>(And take you the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.) 2:125, and,</p><p>عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ</p><p>(It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you.) 66:5.</p>",
    "<h2>Disputing with the Jews and Christians About the Religion of Ibrahim</h2><p>Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them.

    "<h2>Disputing with the Jews and Christians About the Religion of Ibrahim</h2><p>Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.' The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.' So Allah sent down,</p><p>يأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِى إِبْرَهِيمَ</p><p>(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time\" This is why Allah said,</p><p>أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(Have you then no sense)</p><p>Allah then said,</p><p>هأَنتُمْ هَـؤُلاءِ حَـجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِ عِلمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ</p><p>(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p><p>This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad ﷺ was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p><p>وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p><p>Allah said,</p><p>مَا كَانَ إِبْرَهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا</p><p>(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p><p>وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p>(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p><p>This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى تَهْتَدُواْ</p><p>(And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided...\") 2:135.</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>إِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَـذَا النَّبِىُّ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاللَّهُ وَلِىُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed.

Another Hadith</p><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that `Adi bin `Amirah Al-Kindi said, \"Imru' Al-Qays bin `Abis, a man from Kindah, disputed with a man from Hadramut in front of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ concerning a piece of land.

Wahb bin Munabbih said, \"The Tawrah and the Injil remain as Allah revealed them, and no letter in them was removed.

However, if Wahb meant the books that are currently in the hands of the People of the Book, then we should state that there is no doubt that they altered, distorted, added to and deleted from them. For instance, the Arabic versions of these books contain tremendous error, many additions and deletions and enormous misinterpretation. Those who rendered these translations have incorrect comprehension in most, rather, all of these translations. If Wahb meant the Books of Allah that He has with Him, then indeed, these Books are preserved and were never changed.</p>",

I asked you to do what is less and easier than that, but you did not do it,\" and he will be sent back to the Fire.)</p><p>This is why Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.) for they shall not have anyone who will save them from the torment of Allah or rescue them from His painful punishment.</p>"
