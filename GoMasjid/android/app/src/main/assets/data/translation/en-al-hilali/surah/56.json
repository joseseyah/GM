    "Is it you who cause it from the rain-clouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?",
    "If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable): why then do you not give thanks (to Allâh)?",
    "Then tell Me about the fire which you kindle.",
    "Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?",
    "We have made it a Reminder (of the Hell-fire in the Hereafter), and an article of use for the travellers (and all the others, in this world).",

    "Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful?",
    "Then, if he (the dying person) be of the Muqarrabûn (those brought near to Allâh),",
    "(There is for him) rest and provision, and a Garden of Delights (Paradise).",
    "And if he (the dying person) be of those on the Right Hand,",
    "Then there is safety and peace (from the Punishment of Allâh) for those on the right Hand.",
    "But if he (the dying person) be of the denying (of the Resurrection), the erring (away from the Right Path of Islâmic Monotheism),",
    "Then for him is an entertainment with boiling water.",
    "And burning in Hell-fire.",
    "Verily, this! This is an absolute Truth with certainty.",
    "So glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great."
