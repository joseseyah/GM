    "Nūn , by the pen and what they write,",
    "with the grace of your Lord, you are not insane.",
    "And you will definitely have a reward that will never end.",
    "And you are surely on an excellent standard of character.",
    "So, you will see, and they will see",
    "which of you is demented.",
    "Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from his way, and He is well aware of those who are on the right path.",
    "So, do not obey those who reject (the true faith.)",
    "They wish that you become flexible (in your faith), so that they should become flexible (in their hostile attitude.)",
    "And do not obey any contemptible one who swears much,",
    "a slanderer who goes about with calumnies,",
    "one who prevents good, (and who is) transgressor, sinful,",
    "harsh, (and) after all that, notorious,",
    "(do not obey such a person merely) because he is a man of wealth and sons.",
    "When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These are) the tales of the ancient.”",
    "We will soon brand him on the snout.",
    "We have tested them as We had tested the Owners of the Garden, when they had sworn an oath that they would pluck its fruits on the next morning,",
    "and did not make any exception (by saying inshā’allāh ).",
    "Then, there whirled around it a whirl (of calamity) from your Lord, while they were asleep.",
    "Thus, on the next morning, it was like a harvested field.",
    "So, they called out each other as the morning broke,",
    "saying, “Set out early, if you are going to pluck (the fruits).”",
    "So they set out while they were whispering to each other,",
    "saying, “Let no poor man enter into it upon you today.”",
    "And in early hours they rushed quickly, while they were (assuming themselves) powerful (to pluck the fruits and prevent the poor.)",
    "But when they saw it (the place of the ruined garden), they said, “We have missed the way.”",
    "(Then, once they realized that the garden is the same, but it has been destroyed, they said,) “No, but we are deprived (of the fruits).”",
    "Said he who was the best among them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Why do you not pronounce tasbīH (Allah’s purity)?”",
    "They said, “We pronounce the purity of our Lord. No doubt, we were wrongdoers.”",
    "Then, (at the beginning,) they started reproaching one another;",
    "(and at last,) they said, “Woe to us! In fact, we (all) were outrageous.",
    "We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange something better than this. Truly we turn to Allah.”",
    "In this way the punishment comes. And, of course, the punishment of the Hereafter is even greater, if they but realize!",
    "Surely, for the God-fearing there are gardens of bliss.",
    "Otherwise, shall We make the obedient like the sinners?",
    "What has happened to you? How do you judge?",
    "Do you have a book in which you read",
    "that for you there is what you choose?",
    "Or do you have oaths sworn by Us, remaining effective up to the Day of Judgment, that you will get what you decide?",
    "Ask them which of them stands surety for that.",
    "Or do they have associate-gods (who have guaranteed safety for them)? Then, let them bring their associate-gods, if they are true.",
    "On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, and they will be called upon to prostrate themselves, they will not be able to.",
    "With their eyes downcast, they will be enveloped by ignominy. They used to be called upon to prostrate when they were healthy (but they did not.)",
    "So, leave Me alone with those who reject this discourse. We will draw them on little by little (towards Hell) from a way they do not know.",
    "And I give them respite. Indeed, My plan is firm.",
    "Is it that you ask them for a fee, due to which they are burdened with debt?",
    "Or do they have the (knowledge of the) Unseen, and they write it down?",
    "So, remain patient with your Lord’s judgment, and be not like the Man of the Fish, he cried out while he was in anguish.",
    "Had not a favour from His Lord come to his help, he would have been cast in the wilderness in a reproachable state.",
    "Then his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous.",
    "And indeed the disbelievers seem to trip you up with their glances when they hear the Reminder, and say, “He is a madman indeed.”",
    "And it is nothing else but a Reminder for all the worlds."
