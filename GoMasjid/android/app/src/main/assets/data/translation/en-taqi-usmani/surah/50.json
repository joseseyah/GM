    "Qāf . (I swear) by the glorious Qur’ān, (you are sent as a messenger.)",
    "But they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves; so the disbelievers said, “This is something strange.",
    "Is it when we die and become dust (that we will be brought to life again?) That is a return, far (from understanding).”",
    "We know very well how much of them is diminished by the earth, and We have a Book that Preserves every thing.",
    "Rather, they rejected the truth when it came to them; so they are in a confused state.",
    "Did they not, then, look to the sky above them, how We have built it and beautified it, and it has no cracks?",
    "As for the earth, We have spread it out, and cast on it firm hills, and caused to grow therein every kind of delightful things,",
    "as a source of vision and as a lesson to every servant (of Allah) who turns (to Him for guidance).",
    "And We sent down blessed water from the sky, and caused to grow therewith gardens and grain of harvest,",
    "and towering date palms that have spadices, put one upon another,",
    "as a provision to the servants (of Allah). And We gave life with it to a dead land. Similar will be the exit (of the dead from their graves).",
    "It (resurrection) was rejected before them by the people of NūH, and the people of Rass and Thamūd,",
    "and ‘Ād, and Fir’aun (Pharaoh), and the brothers of LūT,",
    "and dwellers of Aaikah, and the people of Tubba’. Each one of them rejected the messengers; so My threat came true.",
    "Is it, then, that We were worn out by the first creation? No, but they are still in confusion about the new creation.",
    "Indeed We have created man, and We know whatever thoughts his inner self develops, and We are closer to him than (his) jugular vein,",
    "when the two receiving angels receive (every human act to record it), seated (one) on the right and (one) on the left.",
    "Not a single word is uttered by one but there is a watcher near him, ready (to record).",
    "The daze of death has (to) come with truth. That is what you tried to escape.",
    "And the Horn will be blown. That will be the day of (which) threat (was given).",
    "And everybody will come, along with one (angel) to drive (him to the field of reckoning) and one (angel) to testify (about his deeds).",
    "“You were heedless of this. Now We have removed your veil from you; so your sight today is sharp.”",
    "And his companion (i.e. the angel who recorded his deeds) will say, “This is what I have with me, ready (to be presented as his record of deeds).”",
    "(Then it will be said,) “Cast, (O two angels,) into Jahannam (Hell) every obstinate disbeliever",
    "who used to prevent (others) from good (behavior), who transgressed all bounds, who cast doubts (in true faith),",
    "who set up another god along with Allah. So cast him (O angels) in the painful punishment.”",
    "His (evil) companion (i.e. the Satan) will say, “O our Lord, I did not cause him to rebel, but he was himself (involved) in straying far from the track.”",
    "He (Allah) will say, “Do not quarrel before Me, while I had sent to you My threat well in advance.",
    "The Word is not changed with Me, and I Am not so unjust to My servants.”",
    "(Remind them of) the Day when We will say to Jahannam (Hell), “Are you filled up?” and it will say, “Are there some more?”",
    "And the Jannah (Paradise) will be brought close for the God-fearing, no longer distant.",
    "(And it will be said,) “This is what you were promised for everyone who was oft-returning to Allah, vigilant (against sins),",
    "the one who feared the RaHmān (The All-Merciful Allah), without seeing Him, and came up with a heart oriented towards Him.",
    "Enter it in peace. That is the Day of Eternity.”",
    "They will have in it whatever they wish, and with Us there are things even more than that.",
    "And how many a generation We have destroyed before them who were stronger than these in their grip on power, and they searched out the cities. Was there any place (for them) to escape?",
    "Indeed, there is a lesson in all this for him who has a heart and gives ear (to the truth) attentively.",
    "We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and no weariness even touched Us.",
    "So, (O Prophet,) endure with patience what they say, and proclaim His purity, along with your Lord’s praise, before sunrise and before sunset.",
    "And in hours of night, proclaim His purity, and at the ends of prostration.",
    "And listen: The Day when the caller will call out from a near place,",
    "the Day they will hear the Cry in reality- that will be the Day of Resurrection.",
    "Surely We alone give life and bring death, and to Us is the final return",
    "on the Day when the earth will burst apart exposing them, while they will be hurrying up (to come out). That is an assembly, so easy for Us (to muster).",
    "We know well what they say, and you are not (sent) as one who compels them. So exhort, through the Qur’ān, the one who fears My warning."
