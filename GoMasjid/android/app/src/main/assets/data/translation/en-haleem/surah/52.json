    "By the mountain,",
    "by a Scripture inscribed",
    "in unrolled parch-ment,",
    "by the much-visited House,",
    "by the raised canopy,",
    "by the ocean ever filled,",
    "[Prophet], your Lord’s punishment is coming––",
    "it cannot be put off––",
    "on the Day when the sky sways back and forth",
    "and the mountains float away.",
    "Woe on that Day to those who deny the Truth,",
    "who amuse themselves with idle chatter:",
    "on that Day they will be thrust into the Fire of Hell.",
    "‘This is the Fire you used to deny.",
    "So is this sorcery? Do you still not see it?",
    "Burn in it––it makes no difference whether you bear it patiently or not–– you are only being repaid for what you have done.’",
    "Those who were mindful of God are in Gardens and in bliss,",
    "rejoicing in their Lord’s gifts: He has saved them from the torment of the Blaze,",
    "‘Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment as a reward for what you have done.’",
    "They are comfortably seated on couches arranged in rows; We pair them with beautiful-eyed maidens;",
    "We unite the believers with their offspring who followed them in faith–– We do not deny them any of the rewards for their deeds: each person is in pledge for his own deeds––",
    "We provide them with any fruit or meat they desire.",
    "They pass around a cup which does not lead to any idle talk or sin.",
    "Devoted youths like hidden pearls wait on them.",
    "They turn to one another and say,",
    "‘When we were still with our families [on earth] we used to live in fear––",
    "God has been gracious to us and saved us from the torment of intense heat-",
    "We used to pray to Him: He is the Good, the Merciful One.’",
    "So [Prophet] remind [people]. By the grace of your Lord [Prophet], you are neither oracle nor madman.",
    "If they say, ‘He is only a poet: we shall await his fate,’",
    "say, ‘Wait if you wish; I too am waiting’-",
    "does their reason really tell them to do this, or are they simply insolent people?",
    "If they say, ‘He has made it up himself’- they certainly do not believe-",
    "let them produce one like it, if what they say is true.",
    "Were they created without any agent? Were they the creators?",
    "Did they create the heavens and the earth? No! They do not have faith.",
    "Do they possess your Lord’s treasures or have control over them?",
    "Do they have a ladder to climb, in order to eavesdrop [on Heaven’s secrets]? Let their eavesdropper produce clear proof.",
    "Does God have daughters while you have sons?",
    "Do you [Prophet] demand a payment from them that would burden them with debt?",
    "Do they have [access to] the unseen? Could they write it down?",
    "Do they think they can ensnare you? It is the disbelievers who have been ensnared.",
    "Do they really have another god besides God? God is far above anything they set alongside Him.",
    "Even if they saw a piece of heaven falling down on them, they would say, ‘Just a heap of clouds,’",
    "so leave them, Prophet, until they face the Day when they will be thunderstruck,",
    "the Day when their snares will be of no use to them, when they will get no help.",
    "Another punishment awaits the evildoers, though most of them do not realize it.",
    "Wait patiently [Prophet] for your Lord’s judgement: you are under Our watchful eye. Celebrate the praise of your Lord when you rise.",
    "Glorify Him at night and at the fading of the stars."
