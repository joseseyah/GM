    "Glory be to the One Who took His servant ˹Muḥammad˺ by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
    "And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guide for the Children of Israel, ˹stating:˺ “Do not take besides Me any other Trustee of Affairs,",
    "˹O˺ descendants of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺! He was indeed a grateful servant.”",
    "And We warned the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will certainly cause corruption in the land twice, and you will become extremely arrogant.",
    "When the first of the two warnings would come to pass, We would send against you some of Our servants of great might, who would ravage your homes. This would be a warning fulfilled.",
    "Then ˹after your repentance˺ We would give you the upper hand over them and aid you with wealth and offspring, causing you to outnumber them.",
    "If you act rightly, it is for your own good, but if you do wrong, it is to your own loss. “And when the second warning would come to pass, your enemies would ˹be left to˺ totally disgrace you and enter that place of worship as they entered it the first time, and utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands.",
    "Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you ˹if you repent˺, but if you return ˹to sin˺, We will return ˹to punishment˺. And We have made Hell a ˹permanent˺ confinement for the disbelievers.”",
    "Surely this Quran guides to what is most upright, and gives good news to the believers—who do good—that they will have a mighty reward.",
    "And ˹it warns˺ those who do not believe in the Hereafter ˹that˺ We have prepared for them a painful punishment.",
    "And humans ˹swiftly˺ pray for evil as they pray for good. For humankind is ever hasty.",
    "We made the day and night as two signs. So We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and We made the sign of the day ˹perfectly˺ bright, so that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. And We have explained everything in detail.",
    "We have bound every human’s destiny to their neck. And on the Day of Judgment We will bring forth to each ˹person˺ a record which they will find laid open.",
    "˹And it will be said,˺ “Read your record. You ˹alone˺ are sufficient this Day to take account of yourself.”",
    "Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And We would never punish ˹a people˺ until We have sent a messenger ˹to warn them˺.",
    "Whenever We intend to destroy a society, We command its elite ˹to obey Allah˺ but they act rebelliously in it. So the decree ˹of punishment˺ is justified, and We destroy it utterly.",
    "˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We have destroyed after Noah! And sufficient is your Lord as All-Aware and All-Seeing of the sins of His servants.",
    "Whoever desires this fleeting world ˹alone˺, We hasten in it whatever We please to whoever We will; then We destine them for Hell, where they will burn, condemned and rejected.",
    "But whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it accordingly, and is a ˹true˺ believer, it is they whose striving will be appreciated.",
    "We provide both the former and the latter from the bounty of your Lord. And the bounty of your Lord can never be withheld.",
    "See how We have favoured some over others ˹in this life˺, but the Hereafter is certainly far greater in rank and in favour.",
    "Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will end up condemned, abandoned.",
    "For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care, never say to them ˹even˺ ‘ugh,’ nor yell at them. Rather, address them respectfully.",
    "And be humble with them out of mercy, and pray, “My Lord! Be merciful to them as they raised me when I was young.”",
    "Your Lord knows best what is within yourselves. If you are righteous, He is certainly All-Forgiving to those who ˹constantly˺ turn to Him.",
    "Give to close relatives their due, as well as the poor and ˹needy˺ travellers. And do not spend wastefully.",
    "Surely the wasteful are ˹like˺ brothers to the devils. And the Devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.",
    "But if you must turn them down ˹because you lack the means to give˺—while hoping to receive your Lord’s bounty—then ˹at least˺ give them a kind word.",
    "Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty.",
    "Surely your Lord gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. He is certainly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.",
    "Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely killing them is a heinous sin.",
    "Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way.",
    "Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right. If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation, for they are already supported ˹by law˺.",
    "Do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Honour ˹your˺ pledges, for you will surely be accountable for them.",
    "Give in full when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is fairest and best in the end.",
    "Do not follow what you have no ˹sure˺ knowledge of. Indeed, all will be called to account for ˹their˺ hearing, sight, and intellect.",
    "And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. Surely you can neither crack the earth nor stretch to the height of the mountains.",
    "The violation of any of these ˹commandments˺ is detestable to your Lord.",
    "This is part of the wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺. And do not set up any other god with Allah ˹O humanity˺, or you will be cast into Hell, blameworthy, rejected.",
    "Has your Lord favoured you ˹pagans˺ with sons and taken angels as ˹His˺ daughters? You are truly making an outrageous claim.",
    "We have surely varied ˹the signs˺ in this Quran so perhaps they may be mindful, but it only drives them farther away.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been other gods besides Him—as they claim—then they would have certainly sought a way to ˹challenge˺ the Lord of the Throne.”",
    "Glorified and Highly Exalted is He above what they claim!",
    "The seven heavens, the earth, and all those in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing that does not glorify His praises—but you ˹simply˺ cannot comprehend their glorification. He is indeed Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving.",
    "When you ˹O Prophet˺ recite the Quran, We put a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter.",
    "We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion.",
    "We know best how they listen to your recitation and what they say privately—when the wrongdoers say, “You would only be following a bewitched man.”",
    "See how they call you names ˹O Prophet˺! So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way.",
    "And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes, even if˺ you become stones, or iron,",
    "or whatever you think is harder to bring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?” Say, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their heads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!”",
    "On the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him, thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while.",
    "Tell My ˹believing˺ servants to say only what is best. Satan certainly seeks to sow discord among them. Satan is indeed a sworn enemy to humankind.",
    "Your Lord knows you best. He may have mercy on you if He wills, or punish you if He wills. We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over them.",
    "Your Lord knows best all those in the heavens and the earth. And We have surely favoured some prophets above others, and to David We gave the Psalms. ",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Invoke those you claim ˹to be divine˺ besides Him—they do not have the power to undo harm from you or transfer it ˹to someone else˺.”",
    "˹Even˺ the closest ˹to Allah˺ of those invoked would be seeking a way to their Lord, hoping for His mercy, and fearing His punishment. Indeed, your Lord’s torment is fearsome.",
    "There is not a ˹wicked˺ society that We will not destroy or punish with a severe torment before the Day of Judgment. That is written in the Record.",
    "Nothing keeps Us from sending the ˹demanded˺ signs except that they had ˹already˺ been denied by earlier peoples. And We gave Thamûd the she-camel as a clear sign, but they wrongfully rejected it. We only send the signs as a warning.",
    "And ˹remember, O  Prophet˺ when We told you, “Certainly your Lord encompasses the people.” And We have made what We brought you to see as well as the cursed tree ˹mentioned˺ in the Quran only as a test for the people. We keep warning them, but it only increases them greatly in defiance.",
    "And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who protested, “Should I prostrate to the one You have created from mud?”",
    "Adding, “Do you see this one you honoured above me? If you delay my end until the Day of Judgment, I will certainly take hold of his descendants, except for a few.”",
    "Allah responded, “Be gone! Whoever of them follows you, Hell will surely be the reward for all of you—an ample reward.",
    "And incite whoever you can of them with your voice, mobilize against them all your cavalry and infantry, manipulate them in their wealth and children, and make them promises.” But Satan promises them nothing but delusion.",
    "˹Allah added,˺ “You will truly have no authority over My ˹faithful˺ servants.” And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.",
    "It is your Lord Who steers the ships for you through the sea, so that you may seek His bounty. Surely He is ever Merciful to you.",
    "When you are touched with hardship at sea, you ˹totally˺ forget all ˹the gods˺ you ˹normally˺ invoke, except Him. But when He delivers you ˹safely˺ to shore, you turn away. Humankind is ever ungrateful.",
    "Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or unleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you.",
    "Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again, and send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then you will find none to avenge you against Us.",
    "Indeed, We have dignified the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, granted them good and lawful provisions, and privileged them far above many of Our creatures.",
    "˹Beware of˺ the Day We will summon every people with their leader. So whoever will be given their record in their right hand will read it ˹happily˺ and will not be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone.",
    "But whoever is blind ˹to the truth˺ in this ˹world˺ will be blind in the Hereafter, and ˹even˺ far more astray from the ˹Right˺ Way.",
    "They definitely ˹thought they˺ were about to lure you away from what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, hoping that you would attribute something else to Us falsely—and then they would have certainly taken you as a close friend.",
    "Had We not made you steadfast, you probably would have inclined to them a little,",
    "and then We truly would have made you taste double ˹punishment˺ both in this life and after death, and you would have found no helper against Us.",
    "They were about to intimidate you to drive you out of the land ˹of Mecca˺, but then they would not have survived after you ˹had left˺ except for a little while.",
    "˹This has been˺ Our way with the messengers We sent before you. And you will never find any change in Our way.",
    "Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by angels˺.",
    "And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional prayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise.",
    "And say, “My Lord! Grant me an honourable entrance and an honourable exit and give me a supporting authority from Yourself.”",
    "And declare, “The truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to vanish.”",
    "We send down the Quran as a healing and mercy for the believers, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss.",
    "When We grant people Our favours, they turn away, acting arrogantly. But when touched with evil, they lose all hope.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Everyone acts in their own way. But your Lord knows best whose way is rightly guided.”",
    "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the spirit. Say, “Its nature is known only to my Lord, and you ˹O humanity˺ have been given but little knowledge.”",
    "If We willed, We could have certainly taken away what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺—then you would find none to guarantee its return from Us—",
    "had it not been for the mercy of your Lord. Indeed, His favour upon you is immense.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.”",
    "And We have truly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for humanity in this Quran, yet most people persist in disbelief.",
    "They challenge ˹the Prophet˺, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us,",
    "or until you have a garden of palm trees and vineyards, and cause rivers to flow abundantly in it,",
    "or cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before us, face to face,",
    "or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend into heaven—and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I not only a human messenger?”",
    "And nothing has prevented people from believing when guidance comes to them except their protest: “Has Allah sent a human as a messenger?”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We would have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a messenger.”",
    "Say, “Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you. He is certainly All-Knowing, All-Seeing of His servants.”",
    "Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, you will find no guardians for them besides Him. And We will drag them on their faces on the Day of Judgment—deaf, dumb, and blind. Hell will be their home. Whenever it dies down, We will flare it up for them.",
    "That is their reward for rejecting Our signs and asking ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?”",
    "Have they not realized that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, can ˹easily˺ re-create them? He has ˹already˺ set for them a time, about which there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers persist in denial.",
    "Say ˹to them, O  Prophet˺, “Even if you were to possess the ˹infinite˺ treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold ˹them˺, fearing they would run out—for humankind is ever stingy!”",
    "We surely gave Moses nine clear signs. ˹You, O  Prophet, can˺ ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I really think that you, O  Moses, are bewitched.”",
    "Moses replied, “You know well that none has sent these ˹signs˺ down except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as insights. And I really think that you, O  Pharaoh, are doomed.”",
    "So Pharaoh wanted to scare the Israelites out of the land ˹of Egypt˺, but We drowned him and all of those with him.",
    "And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh, “Reside in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We will bring you all together.”",
    "We have sent down the Quran in truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a deliverer of good news and a warner.",
    "˹It is˺ a Quran We have revealed in stages so that you may recite it to people at a deliberate pace. And We have sent it down in successive revelations.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Believe in this ˹Quran˺, or do not. Indeed, when it is recited to those who were gifted with knowledge before it ˹was revealed˺, they fall upon their faces in prostration,",
    "and say, ‘Glory be to our Lord! Surely the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.’",
    "And they fall down upon their faces weeping, and it increases them in humility.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate—whichever you call, He has the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between.",
    "And say, “All praise is for Allah, Who has never had ˹any˺ offspring; nor does He have a partner in ˹governing˺ the kingdom; nor is He pathetic, needing a protector. And revere Him immensely.”",
    "All praise is for Allah Who has revealed the Book to His servant, allowing no crookedness in it,",
    "˹making it˺ perfectly upright, to warn ˹the disbelievers˺ of a severe torment from Him; to give good news to the believers—who do good—that they will have a fine reward,",
    "in which they will remain forever;",
    "and to warn those who claim, “Allah has offspring.”",
    "They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies.",
    "Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message.",
    "We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds.",
    "And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to barren ground.",
    "Have you ˹O Prophet˺ thought that the people of the cave and the plaque were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs?",
    "˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.”",
    "So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep in the cave for many years,",
    "then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay. ",
    "We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.",
    "And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”",
    "˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah?",
    "Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.”",
    "And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space. That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor.",
    "And you would have thought they were awake, though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror.",
    "And so We awakened them so that they might question one another. One of them exclaimed, “How long have you remained ˹asleep˺?” Some replied, “Perhaps a day, or part of a day.” They said ˹to one another˺, “Your Lord knows best how long you have remained. So send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the purest, and then bring you provisions from it. Let him be ˹exceptionally˺ cautious, and do not let him give you away.",
    "For, indeed, if they find out about you, they will stone you ˹to death˺, or force you back into their faith, and then you will never succeed.”",
    "That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺, some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”",
    "Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge, nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them.",
    "And never say of anything, “I will definitely do this tomorrow,”",
    "without adding, “if Allah so wills!” But if you forget, then remember your Lord, and say, “I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than this.”",
    "They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him ˹alone˺ is ˹the knowledge of˺ the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How perfectly He hears and sees! They have no guardian besides Him, and He shares His command with none.”",
    "Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His Words, nor can you find any refuge besides Him.",
    "And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires and whose state is ˹total˺ loss.",
    "And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will ˹completely˺ surround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like molten metal, which will burn ˹their˺ faces. What a horrible drink! And what a terrible place to rest!",
    "As for those who believe and do good, We certainly never deny the reward of those who are best in deeds.",
    "It is they who will have the Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade, reclining there on ˹canopied˺ couches. What a marvellous reward! And what a fabulous place to rest!",
    "Give them ˹O Prophet˺ an example of two men. To ˹the disbelieving˺ one We gave two gardens of grapevines, which We surrounded with palm trees and placed ˹various˺ crops in between.",
    "Each garden yielded ˹all˺ its produce, never falling short. And We caused a river to flow between them.",
    "And he had other resources ˹as well˺. So he boasted to a ˹poor˺ companion of his, while conversing with him, “I am greater than you in wealth and superior in manpower.”",
    "And he entered his property, while wronging his soul, saying, “I do not think this will ever perish,",
    "nor do I think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, I will definitely get a far better outcome than ˹all˺ this.”",
    "His ˹believing˺ companion replied, while conversing with him, “Do you disbelieve in the One Who created you from dust, then ˹developed you˺ from a sperm-drop, then formed you into a man?",
    "But as for me: He is Allah, my Lord, and I will never associate anyone with my Lord ˹in worship˺.",
    "If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is what Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though you see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring,",
    "perhaps my Lord will grant me ˹something˺ better than your garden, and send down upon your garden a thunderbolt from the sky, turning it into a barren waste.",
    "Or its water may sink ˹into the earth˺, and then you will never be able to seek it out.”",
    "And so all his produce was ˹totally˺ ruined, so he started to wring his hands for all he had spent on it, while it had collapsed on its trellises. He cried, “Alas! I wish I had never associated anyone with my Lord ˹in worship˺!”",
    "And he had no manpower to help him against Allah, nor could he ˹even˺ help himself.",
    "At this time, support comes ˹only˺ from Allah—the True ˹Lord˺. He is best in reward and best in outcome.",
    "And give them a parable of this worldly life. ˹It is˺ like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then they ˹soon˺ turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable of ˹doing˺ all things.",
    "Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in hope. ",
    "˹Beware of˺ the Day We will blow the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare. And We will gather all ˹humankind˺, leaving none behind.",
    "They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the deniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We created you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.”",
    "And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it. They will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present ˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone.",
    "And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺!",
    "I never called them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth or ˹even˺ their own creation, nor would I take the misleaders as helpers.",
    "And ˹beware of˺ the Day He will say, “Call upon those you claimed were My associate-gods.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And We will make them ˹all˺ share in the same doom.",
    "The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it.",
    "We have surely set forth in this Quran every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings.",
    "And nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness except ˹their demand˺ to meet the same fate of earlier deniers or that the torment would confront them face to face.",
    "We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings.",
    "And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
    "Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them ˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge.",
    "Those ˹are the˺ societies We destroyed when they persisted in wrong, and We had set a time for their destruction.",
    "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his young assistant, “I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages.”",
    "But when they ˹finally˺ reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their ˹salted˺ fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away ˹wondrously˺.",
    "When they had passed further, he said to his assistant, “Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today’s journey.”",
    "He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? ˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”",
    "Moses responded, “That is ˹exactly˺ what we were looking for.” So they returned, retracing their footsteps.",
    "There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.",
    "Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?”",
    "He said, “You certainly cannot be patient ˹enough˺ with me.",
    "And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?”",
    "Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.”",
    "He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.”",
    "So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!”",
    "He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?”",
    "Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.”",
    "So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.”"
