    "who created you, then perfected you, then brought you in due proportion?",
    "He composed you in whichever form He willed.",
    "Never! (i.e. one should never be heedless towards him.) But you deny the Requital,",
    "while (appointed) over you there are watchers,",
    "who are noble, writers (of the deeds),",
    "who know whatever you do.",
    "Surely the righteous will be in bliss,",
    "and the sinners in Hell,",
    "in which they will enter on the Day of Requital,",
    "and they will not (be able to) keep away from it.",
    "And what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?",
    "Again, what may let you know what the Day of Requital is?",
    "A Day when no one will have power to do any thing for another! And command, on that Day, will belong to Allah (alone)."
