    "And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allāh is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register.",
    "And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water - that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say, \"Indeed, you are resurrected after death,\" those who disbelieve will surely say, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"",
    "And if We hold back from them the punishment for a limited time, they will surely say, \"What detains it?\" Unquestionably, on the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.",
    "And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful.",
    "But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him, he will surely say, \"Bad times have left me.\" Indeed, he is exultant and boastful -",
    "Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds; those will have forgiveness and great reward.",
    "Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you, or is your breast constrained by it because they say, \"Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?\" But you are only a warner. And Allāh is Disposer of all things.",
    "Or do they say, \"He invented it\"? Say, \"Then bring ten sūrahs like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allāh, if you should be truthful.\"",
    "And if they do not respond to you - then know that it [i.e., the Qur’ān] was revealed with the knowledge of Allāh and that there is no deity except Him. Then, would you [not] be Muslims?",
    "Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they therein will not be deprived.",
    "Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire. And lost is what they did therein, and worthless is what they used to do.",
    "So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord [like the aforementioned]? And a witness from Him follows it, and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as mercy. Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in it [i.e., the Qur’ān]. But whoever disbelieves in it from the [various] factions - the Fire is his promised destination. So be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.",
    "And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allāh? Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Unquestionably, the curse of Allāh is upon the wrongdoers.",
    "Who averted [people] from the way of Allāh and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they, concerning the Hereafter, were disbelievers.",
    "Those were not causing failure [to Allāh] on earth, nor did they have besides Allāh any protectors. For them the punishment will be multiplied. They were not able to hear, nor did they see.",
    "Those are the ones who will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent.",
    "Assuredly, it is they in the Hereafter who will be the greatest losers.",
    "Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their Lord - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide eternally therein.",
    "The example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Then, will you not remember?",
    "And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, [saying], \"Indeed, I am to you a clear warner",
    "That you not worship except Allāh. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.\"",
    "So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, \"We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion. And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars.\"",
    "He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord while He has given me mercy from Himself but it has been made unapparent to you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?",
    "And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allāh. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.",
    "And O my people, who would protect me from Allāh if I drove them away? Then will you not be reminded?",
    "And I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allāh or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your eyes look down that Allāh will never grant them any good. Allāh is most knowing of what is within their souls. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\"",
    "They said, \"O Noah, you have disputed [i.e., opposed] us and been frequent in dispute of us. So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful.\"",
    "He said, \"Allāh will only bring it to you if He wills, and you will not cause [Him] failure.",
    "And my advice will not benefit you - although I wished to advise you - if Allāh should intend to put you in error. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.\"",
    "Or do they say [about Prophet Muḥammad (ﷺ)], \"He invented it\"? Say, \"If I have invented it, then upon me is [the consequence of] my crime; but I am innocent of what [crimes] you commit.\"",
    "And it was revealed to Noah that, \"No one will believe from your people except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing.",
    "And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned.\"",
    "And he constructed the ship, and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, \"If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule.",
    "And you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment [in the Hereafter].\"",
    "[So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, \"Load upon it [i.e., the ship] of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word [i.e., decree] has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed.\" But none had believed with him, except a few.",
    "And [Noah] said, \"Embark therein; in the name of Allāh [are] its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"",
    "And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], \"O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers.\"",
    "[But] he said, \"I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.\" [Noah] said, \"There is no protector today from the decree of Allāh, except for whom He gives mercy.\" And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.",
    "And it was said, \"O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain].\" And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and it [i.e., the ship] came to rest on the [mountain of] Jūdiyy. And it was said, \"Away with the wrongdoing people.\"",
    "And Noah called to his Lord and said, \"My Lord, indeed my son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is true; and You are the most just of judges!\"",
    "He said, \"O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work was other than righteous, so ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you, lest you be among the ignorant.\"",
    "[Noah] said, \"My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.\"",
    "It was said, \"O Noah, disembark in security from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations [descending] from those with you. But other nations [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then there will touch them from Us a painful punishment.\"",
    "That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muḥammad]. You knew it not, neither you nor your people, before this. So be patient; indeed, the [best] outcome is for the righteous.",
    "And to ʿAad [We sent] their brother Hūd. He said, \"O my people, worship Allāh; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood].",
    "O my people, I do not ask you for it [i.e., my advice] any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Then will you not reason?",
    "And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, [being] criminals.\"",
    "They said, \"O Hūd, you have not brought us clear evidence, and we are not ones to leave our gods on your say-so. Nor are we believers in you.",
    "We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil [i.e., insanity].\" He said, \"Indeed, I call Allāh to witness, and witness [yourselves] that I am free from whatever you associate with Allāh",
    "Other than Him. So plot against me all together; then do not give me respite.",
    "Indeed, I have relied upon Allāh, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but that He holds it by its forelock [i.e., controls it]. Indeed, my Lord is on a path [that is] straight.",
    "But if you turn away, then I have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you. My Lord will give succession to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian.\"",
    "And when Our command came, We saved Hūd and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us; and We saved them from a harsh punishment.",
    "And that was ʿAad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant.",
    "And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, ʿAad denied their Lord; then away with ʿAad, the people of Hūd.",
    "And to Thamūd [We sent] their brother Ṣāliḥ. He said, \"O my people, worship Allāh; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive.\"",
    "They said, \"O Ṣāliḥ, you were among us a man of promise before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? And indeed we are, about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt.\"",
    "He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself, who would protect me from Allāh if I disobeyed Him? So you would not increase me except in loss.",
    "And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allāh - [she is] to you a sign. So let her feed upon Allāh's earth and do not touch her with harm, or you will be taken by an impending punishment.\"",
    "But they hamstrung her, so he said, \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise not to be denied [i.e., unfailing].\"",
    "So when Our command came, We saved Ṣāliḥ and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us, and [saved them] from the disgrace of that day. Indeed, it is your Lord who is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.",
    "And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone",
    "As if they had never prospered therein. Unquestionably, Thamūd denied their Lord; then, away with Thamūd.",
    "And certainly did Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to Abraham with good tidings; they said, \"Peace.\" He said, \"Peace,\" and did not delay in bringing [them] a roasted calf.",
    "But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension. They said, \"Fear not. We have been sent to the people of Lot.\"",
    "And his wife was standing, and she smiled. Then We gave her good tidings of Isaac and after Isaac, Jacob.",
    "She said, \"Woe to me! Shall I give birth while I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? Indeed, this is an amazing thing!\"",
    "They said, \"Are you amazed at the decree of Allāh? May the mercy of Allāh and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.\"",
    "And when the fright had left Abraham and the good tidings had reached him, he began to argue [i.e., plead] with Us concerning the people of Lot.",
    "Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, grieving and [frequently] returning [to Allāh].",
    "[The angels said], \"O Abraham, give up this [plea]. Indeed, the command of your Lord has come, and indeed, there will reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled.\"",
    "And when Our messengers, [the angels], came to Lot, he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said, \"This is a trying day.\"",
    "And his people came hastening to him, and before [this] they had been doing evil deeds. He said, \"O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Allāh and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?\"",
    "They said, \"You have already known that we have not concerning your daughters [i.e., women] any claim [i.e., desire], and indeed, you know what we want.\"",
    "He said, \"If only I had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support.\"",
    "They [the angels] said, \"O Lot, indeed we are messengers of your Lord; [therefore], they will never reach you. So set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back - except your wife; indeed, she will be struck by that which strikes them. Indeed, their appointment is [for] the morning. Is not the morning near?\"",
    "So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were]",
    "Marked from your Lord. And it [i.e., Allāh's punishment] is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.",
    "And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shuʿayb. He said, \"O my people, worship Allāh; you have no deity other than Him. And do not decrease from the measure and the scale. Indeed, I see you in prosperity, but indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing Day.",
    "And O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.",
    "What remains [lawful] from Allāh is best for you, if you would be believers. But I am not a guardian over you.\"",
    "They said, \"O Shuʿayb, does your prayer [i.e., religion] command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please? Indeed, you are the forbearing, the discerning!\"",
    "He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from Him...? And I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you; I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allāh. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.",
    "And O my people, let not [your] dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of Noah or the people of Hūd or the people of Ṣāliḥ. And the people of Lot are not from you far away.",
    "And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affectionate.\"",
    "They said, \"O Shuʿayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and indeed, we consider you among us as weak. And if not for your family, we would have stoned you [to death]; and you are not to us one respected.\"",
    "He said, \"O my people, is my family more respected for power by you than Allāh? But you put Him behind your backs [in neglect]. Indeed, my Lord is encompassing of what you do.",
    "And O my people, work according to your position; indeed, I am working. You are going to know to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar. So watch; indeed, I am with you a watcher, [awaiting the outcome].\"",
    "And when Our command came, We saved Shuʿayb and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us. And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone",
    "As if they had never prospered therein. Then, away with Madyan as Thamūd was taken away.",
    "And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority",
    "To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not [at all] discerning.",
    "He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the place to which they are led.",
    "And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the Day of Resurrection. And wretched is the gift which is given.",
    "That is from the news of the cities, which We relate to you; of them, some are [still] standing and some are [as] a harvest [mowed down].",
    "And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. And they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than Allāh when there came the command of your Lord. And they did not increase them in other than ruin.",
    "And thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the cities while they are committing wrong. Indeed, His seizure is painful and severe.",
    "Indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which the people will be collected, and that is a Day [which will be] witnessed.",
    "And We do not delay it except for a limited term.",
    "The Day it comes no soul will speak except by His permission. And among them will be the wretched and the prosperous.",
    "As for those who were [destined to be] wretched, they will be in the Fire. For them therein is [violent] exhaling and inhaling.",
    "[They will be] abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord should will. Indeed, your Lord is an effecter of what He intends.",
    "And as for those who were [destined to be] prosperous, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord should will - a bestowal uninterrupted.",
    "So do not be in doubt, [O Muḥammad], as to what these [polytheists] are worshipping. They worship not except as their fathers worshipped before. And indeed, We will give them their share undiminished.",
    "And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement. And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the Qur’ān], in disquieting doubt.",
    "And indeed, each [of the believers and disbelievers] - your Lord will fully compensate them for their deeds. Indeed, He is Aware of what they do.",
    "So remain on a right course as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turned back with you [to Allāh], and do not transgress. Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.",
    "And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire, and you would not have other than Allāh any protectors; then you would not be helped.",
    "And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember.",
    "And be patient, for indeed, Allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.",
    "So why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth - except a few of those We saved from among them? But those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein, and they were criminals.",
    "And your Lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers.",
    "And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ,",
    "Except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He created them. But the word of your Lord is to be fulfilled that, \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.\"",
    "And each [story] We relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which We make firm your heart. And there has come to you, in this, the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers.",
    "And say to those who do not believe, \"Work according to your position; indeed, we are working.",
    "And wait; indeed, we are waiting.\"",
    "And to Allāh belong the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and to Him will be returned the matter, all of it, so worship Him and rely upon Him. And your Lord is not unaware of that which you do.",
    "Alif, Lām, Rā. These are the verses of the clear Book.",
    "Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’ān that you might understand.",
    "We relate to you, [O Muḥammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’ān although you were, before it, among the unaware.",
    "[Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father, \"O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.\"",
    "He said, \"O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.",
    "And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives [i.e., events or dreams] and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise.\"",
    "Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask, [such as]",
    "When they said, \"Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error.",
    "Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance [i.e., attention] of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people.\"",
    "Said a speaker among them, \"Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something].\"",
    "They said, \"O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors?",
    "Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians.\"",
    "[Jacob] said, \"Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware.\"",
    "They said, \"If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers.\"",
    "So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well... But We inspired to him, \"You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity].\"",
    "And they came to their father at night, weeping.",
    "They said, \"O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful.\"",
    "And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allāh is the one sought for help against that which you describe.\"",
    "And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, \"Good news! Here is a boy.\" And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allāh was Knowing of what they did.",
    "And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little.",
    "And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, \"Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.\" And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events [i.e., dreams]. And Allāh is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know.",
    "And when he [i.e., Joseph] reached maturity, We gave him judgement and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good.",
    "And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, \"Come, you.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allāh. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\"",
    "And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof [i.e., sign] of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.",
    "And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, \"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?\"",
    "[Joseph] said, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" And a witness from her family testified, \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.",
    "But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.\"",
    "So when he [i.e., her husband] saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, \"Indeed, it is of your [i.e., women's] plan. Indeed, your plan is great [i.e., vehement].",
    "Joseph, ignore this. And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful.\"",
    "And women in the city said, \"The wife of al-ʿAzeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error.\"",
    "So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, \"Perfect is Allāh! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.\"",
    "She said, \"That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased.\"",
    "He said, \"My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant.\"",
    "So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.",
    "Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that he [i.e., al-ʿAzeez] should surely imprison him for a time.",
    "And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing [grapes for] wine.\" The other said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good.\"",
    "He said, \"You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allāh, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.",
    "And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allāh. That is from the favor of Allāh upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful.",
    "O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allāh, the One, the Prevailing?",
    "You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allāh has sent down no evidence. Legislation is not but for Allāh. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.",
    "O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire.\"",
    "And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, \"Mention me before your master.\" But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and he [i.e., Joseph] remained in prison several years.",
    "And [subsequently] the king said, \"Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions.\"",
    "They said, \"[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams.\"",
    "But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, \"I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.\"",
    "[He said], \"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people [i.e., the king and his court]; perhaps they will know [about you].\"",
    "[Joseph] said, \"You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat.",
    "Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you advanced [i.e., saved] for them, except a little from which you will store.",
    "Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes].\"",
    "And the king said, \"Bring him to me.\" But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, \"Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan.\"",
