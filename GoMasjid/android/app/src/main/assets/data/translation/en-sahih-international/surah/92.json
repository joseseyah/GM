    "By the night when it covers",

    "And [by] He who created the male and female,",
    "Indeed, your efforts are diverse.",
    "As for he who gives and fears AllƒÅh",
    "And believes in the best [reward],",
    "We will ease him toward ease.",
    "But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need",
    "And denies the best [reward],",
    "We will ease him toward difficulty.",
    "And what will his wealth avail him when he falls?",
    "Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.",
    "And indeed, to us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life].",
    "So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing.",
    "None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one",
    "Who had denied and turned away.",
    "But the righteous one will avoid it",
    "[He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself",
    "And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded",
    "But only seeking the face [i.e., acceptance] of his Lord, Most High.",
    "And he is going to be satisfied."
