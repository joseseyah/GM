    "Said those who do not even expect to meet Us, “Why the angels are not sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?” Indeed they think too highly of themselves, and have gone too far in rebellion.",
    "The Day they will see the angels, there will be no good news for the sinners that day, and they will say, “(We need) a shelter, fully protected!”",
    "And We will proceed to whatever deeds they did, and will turn them into scattered dust.",
    "The people of Paradise, on that day, will be the best in (terms of their) abode and best in (terms of their) resting-place.",
    "The Day the sky will break open with a cloud, and the angels will be sent down in a majestic descent,",
    "the Kingdom on that day will be for the RaHmān (the All-Merciful, Allah), and it will be a difficult day for the disbelievers.",
    "And (Be mindful of) the Day the wrongdoer will bite his hands saying, “Would that I had taken a path along with the messenger!",
    "Woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so for my friend!",
    "Indeed he led me astray from the advice after it had come to me.” And the Satan is man’s betrayer.",
    "And the messenger will say, “O my Lord, my people had taken this Qur’ān as deserted.”",
    "In a similar way We made for every prophet an enemy from among the sinners, but your Lord suffices as a guide and as a supporter.",
    "Said those who disbelieved, “Why has the Qur’ān not been revealed to him all at once?” (It has been sent down) in this way (i.e. in parts) so that We make your heart firm, and We revealed it little by little.",
    "They bring to you no hypothesis, but We bring to you the correct position and (an answer) better explained.",
    "Those who will be driven on their faces to Hell - they are the worst in situation and far more astray from the path.",
    "Surely We gave Mūsā the Book, and appointed his brother Hārūn as a minister with him.",
    "So we said, “Go, both of you, to the people who have rejected Our signs” Then We annihilated them totally.",
    "As for the people of NūH, when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them and made them an example for mankind, and We have prepared a painful punishment for the transgressors.",
    "And (We annihilated also the peoples of) ‘Ād and Thamūd and the people of Rass, and many generations in between them.",
    "To each (of them) We cited examples, and each of them We brought to utter ruin.",
    "Indeed they (the pagans of Makkah) have passed by the town that was afflicted by an evil rain sent down to it. So, have they not been seeing it? Rather, they do not believe in Resurrection.",
    "When they see you, they take you only as a laughing stock, (saying) “Is this the man whom Allah has sent as a messenger?",
    "He would have almost led us astray from our gods, had we not been so firm towards them.” They will know when they will see the punishment, who is farther astray in his way.",
    "Tell me about the one who has taken his desire as his god, would you then, become a guardian for him?",
    "Or do you think that most of them listen or understand? They are but like cattle. Rather, they are even farther astray from the (right) way.",
    "Have you not observed how your Lord stretched out the shadow (of the sun)? If He so willed, He would have made it stand still. Then We made the sun an indicator for it.",
    "Then We pulled it toward Us in a gradual manner.",
    "He is the One who has made the night an apparel for you, and the sleep a means of rest, and has made the day a means of revival.",
    "And He is the One who has sent the winds conveying good news before His mercy, and We have sent down purifying water from the heavens,",
    "so that We revive a dead land therewith, and give drink to the many cattle and humans created by Us.",
    "And We have distributed it (the water) among them, so that they may take lesson. Yet most of the people refused all but ungratefulness.",
    "Had We so willed, We would have sent a (separate) warner for every town, (but, according to Our wisdom, We have sent Muhammad as a prophet for all these towns)",
    "So, (O Prophet,) do not obey the infidels, and strive against them with it (the Qur’ān), in utmost endeavor.",
    "He is the One who joined the two seas, so as this is sweet, very sweet, and this is bitter, very bitter, and made between them a buffer and an insurmountable barrier.",
    "And He is the One who created man from water, then made of him relations created by lineage and relations created by marriage. Your Lord is All-Powerful.",
    "They worship, instead of Allah, what can neither give them any benefit nor can cause them any harm. The disbeliever is always a supporter (of Satan) against his Lord.",
    "We did not send you but as a bearer of good news and as a warner.",
    "Say, “I do not demand from you any return, except that one should adopt the (proper) way to his Lord, if he so wills.",
    "And place your trust in the Ever-Living who cannot die, and proclaim His purity along with His praise. Enough is He to be aware of the sins of His servants,",
    "the One who created in six days the heavens and the earth and whatever lies between them, then He positioned Himself on the Throne. (He is) the RaHmān (the All-Merciful, Allah). So ask about Him someone who knows.",
    "And when it is said to them, “Prostrate yourselves to the RaHmān (the All-Merciful, Allah),” they say “What is RaHmān? Shall we prostrate ourselves to the one to whom you direct us?” And it increases nothing in them except aversion.",
    "Glorious is the One who made stellar formations in the sky, and placed therein a lamp (i.e. the sun) and a bright moon.",
    "And He is the One who made the day and the night following each other, for the one who wishes to be mindful or wishes to show gratitude.",
    "The servants of the RaHmān (the All-Merciful, Allah) are those who walk on the earth humbly, and when the ignorant people speak to them, they reply peacefully,",
    "and those who pass the night prostrating themselves and standing before their Lord,",
    "and those who say, “Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Jahannam (the Hell); indeed, its punishment is a persisting affliction.”",
    "Indeed, it is evil as an abode and a place to dwell in",
    "- and those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor miserly, and it (i.e. their spending) is moderate in between (the two extremes,)",
    "- and those who do not invoke any other god along with Allah, and do not kill a person whom Allah has given sanctity, except rightfully, nor do they fornicate; and whoever does it, shall face the recompense of his sin,",
    "the punishment will be doubled for him, and he will remain there disdained, for ever,",
    "except the one who repents and believes and does good deeds, then Allah will replace the evils of such people by good deeds, and Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "Whoever repents and does righteous deeds turns to Allah truly",
    "- and those who do not witness falsehood, and when they pass by the absurd things, Pass by them with dignity,",
    "and those who, when they are reminded of the verses of their Lord, do not fall at them as deaf and blind ones,",
    "- and those who say, “Our Lord, Give us, from our spouses and our children, comfort of eyes, and make us heads of the God-fearing.”",
    "Such people will be rewarded with the high place - because they observed patience - and will be received therein with prayers of their eternal life and peace,",
    "living in it (the Paradise) for ever. It is best as an abode and as a place to dwell in.",
    "Say (O Prophet), “My Lord will never care about you, if you will not invoke Him. Now since you rejected (the truth), the punishment will be inseparable from you.”",
    "Tā sīn mīm.",
    "These are the verses of the manifest Book.",
    "(O Prophet,) perhaps you are going to let yourself collapse in grief because they do not believe.",
    "If We so will, We can send down to them a sign from the sky, for which their necks will stay bent in submission.",
    "Never a new message comes to them from the RaHmān (the All-Merciful Allah), but they become averse to it.",
    "Thus they rejected (the Truth); well, soon will come to them the real descriptions of what they used to ridicule.",
    "Have they not looked at the earth, how many of the noble pairs (of vegetation) We have caused to grow in it?",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "(Remember) when your Lord called Mūsā saying, “Go to the transgressing people,",
    "the people of Pharaoh. Do they not fear Allah?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “My Lord, I fear that they will reject me.",
    "My heart gets straitened, and my tongue is not fluent; so send for Hārūn.",
    "Moreover, they have (leveled) a charge of offence against me, and I fear they will kill me;”",
    "He (Allah) said, “Never! (They will not be able to kill you.) So go, both of you, with Our signs. We are with you, listening (to the conversation you will have with him.)",
    "So go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say, ‘We both are messengers of the Lord of all the worlds,",
    "(sent with the message) that you must send the children of Isrā’īl with us’”.",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “Did we not nourish you among us as a child? And you remained amidst us for years,",
    "and you did the blunder you did; still you are ungrateful.”",
    "He said, “I did that at a time when I was mistaken.",
    "Then I fled away from you when I feared you. Thereafter my Lord granted wisdom to me, and made me one of the messengers.",
    "As for the favor with which you are obliging me, it is that you have enslaved the children of Isrā’īl.”",
    "Pharaoh said, “What is the Lord of the worlds?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever there is between them, if you are to believe”",
    "He (The Pharaoh) said to those around him, “Are you not hearing?”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your early forefathers”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “Your messenger who is sent to you is a mad man indeed.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said, “Lord of the East and the West and whatever lies between them, if you are to understand.”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “If you adopt a God other than me, I will certainly put you to prison.”",
    "He (Mūsā) said “Will you (do this) even if I bring to you something evident?”",
    "He said, “Then bring it, if you are truthful.”",
    "So, he threw down his staff, and in no time it was a serpent, clearly visible,",
    "and he drew out his hand, and right then it was a white light to the onlookers.",
    "He (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him “This man is certainly an expert sorcerer”.",
    "He wants to expel you from your land with his sorcery. So what do you suggest?”",
    "They said, “Leave him and his brother alone for some time, and send heralds to the cities,",
    "so that they bring to you every highly expert sorcerer.”",
    "So the sorcerers were assembled for the appointed time of a known day,",
    "and it was said to the people, “Would you assemble,",
    "so that we may follow the sorcerers if they are victorious?”",
    "So, when the sorcerers came, they said to Pharaoh, “Will there be a sure reward for us, if we are the victorious?”",
    "He said, “Yes, and of course, you will then be among the closer ones.”",
    "Mūsā said to them, “Throw you down what you are to throw.”",
    "So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and said, “By the majesty of Pharaoh, we will be the triumphant for sure.”",
    "Then Mūsā threw down his staff, and in no time it started swallowing the falsehood they invented.",
    "So the sorcerers were made (by the truth they saw) to fall down in prostration.",
    "They said, “We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,",
    "the Lord of Mūsā and Hārūn.”",
    "He (Pharaoh) said, “You have believed in him before I permit you. Surely, he (Mūsā) is the chief of you all, who has taught you sorcery. So you will soon know (your fate). I will cut off your hands and feet from different sides, and will crucify you all together.",
    "They said, “There is no harm. We will return to our Lord.",
    "We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our faults, as we are the first of the believers.”",
    "And We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Make My servants travel at night. You will be pursued.”",
    "So Pharaoh sent into the cities (his) men to muster (people)",
    "saying, “These are a small band,",
    "and indeed they are enraging us,",
    "and we are a host, well-armed.”",
    "Thus We expelled them (i.e. the people of Pharaoh) from gardens and springs,",
    "and from treasures and a noble abode.",
    "Thus it was. And We made the children of Isrā’īl inherit all such things.",
    "So they (the people of Pharaoh) pursued them (the people of Mūsā) at the time of sunrise.",
    "And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Mūsā said, “Surely we are overtaken.”",
    "He said, “Never! Indeed with me is my Lord. He will guide me.”",
    "So We revealed to Mūsā saying, “Strike the sea with your staff.” So it was severed apart, and each part became like a big mountain.",
    "Then We brought others close to that place.",
    "And We saved Mūsā and all those with him.",
    "Then we drowned the others.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "And recite before them the narrative of Ibrāhīm,",
    "when he said to his father and to his people, “What do you worship?”",
    "They said, “We worship idols, and stay devoted to them.”",
    "He said, “Do they listen to you when you call (them)",
    "or do they bring benefit to you or harm?”",
    "They said, “No, but we have found our fathers doing like this.”",
    "He said, “Have you then ever considered what you have been worshipping,",
    "you and your ancient fathers,",
    "they all are an enemy to me, except the Lord of the worlds,",
    "who created me, and who guides me,",
    "and Who feeds me and gives me drink,",
    "and when I become sick, He heals me,",
    "and who will make me die, then will give me life,",
    "and who, I hope, will forgive my fault on the Day of Retribution.",
    "O my Lord, give me wisdom, and make me join the righteous,",
    "and destine for me a truthful description among the next generations,",
    "and make me among those who will inherit the Garden of Bliss,",
    "and forgive my father. Indeed he was one of those who went astray,",
    "and do not put me to disgrace on the Day when all will be raised to life,",
    "the Day when neither wealth will be of any use (to any one) nor sons,",
    "except to him who will come to Allah with a sound heart,",
    "and the Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing",
    "and the Hell will be fully uncovered for the perverse,",
    "and it will be said to them, ‘Where is that which you used to worship",
    "beside Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?’",
    "So they (their false gods) will be thrown on their faces into it - they and the erring people",
    "and the entire army of Iblīs (Satan), all together.",
    "They will say when they will be quarreling there with each other,",
    "‘By Allah, we were in open error",
    "when we used to equate you with the Lord of the worlds,",
    "and it is only the sinners who misguided us.",
    "Now we have neither any intercessors",
    "nor any true friend.",
    "Would that we have a chance to return whereby we may join the believers!’”",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of NūH rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother NūH said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So, fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds;",
    "so, fear Allah and obey me.”",
    "They said, “Shall we believe in you while you are followed by the lowest people?”",
    "He said, “I do not know about what they do;",
    "their account is with none but with my Lord, if you have sense.",
    "And I am not the one who would drive the believers away;",
    "I am no more than a plain warner.”",
    "They said, “Should you not stop, O NūH, you will surely be stoned.”",
    "He said, “My Lord, my people have rejected me.",
    "So judge between me and them with an open verdict, and save me and all the believers who are with me.”",
    "So We saved him and those with him in the Ark that was fully occupied.",
    "Then We drowned, after that, all the remaining.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful.",
    "The (people of) ‘Ād rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother Hūd said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you,",
    "so fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Do you erect on every height a monument, having no sound purpose,",
    "and take the objects of architecture as if you are going to live forever,",
    "and when you seize (someone) you seize as tyrants?",
    "So fear Allah and obey me.",
    "And fear the One who has supported you with what you know.",
    "He has supported you with cattle and sons,",
    "and with gardens and springs.",
    "In fact I fear for you the punishment of a horrible day.”",
    "They said, “It is all equal for us, whether you give us advice or you do not become one of the advisors.",
    "This is nothing but the practice of the ancient,",
    "and we are not going to be punished.”",
    "Thus they rejected him, so We destroyed them. Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The (people of) Thamūd rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother SāliH said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So, fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Will you be left secure in whatever is here,",
    "in gardens and springs,",
    "and in farms and date-palms, the spathes of which are interwoven?",
    "You hew out houses from the hills with pride.",
    "So fear Allah and obey me,",
    "and do not obey the order of the transgressors",
    "who make mischief on the land and who do not set things right”.",
    "They said, “You are merely one of those bewitched.",
    "You are nothing but a human like us. So, bring a sign if you are one of the truthful.”",
    "He said, “This is a she-camel. She has a share of water, and you have a share of water on a specified day.",
    "So do not touch her with evil (intent), lest you should be seized by a painful punishment.”",
    "But they killed her, then they became remorseful,",
    "and the punishment seized them. Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of LūT rejected the messengers",
    "when their brother LūT said to them, “Do you not fear Allah?",
    "I am an honest messenger for you.",
    "So fear Allah and obey me.",
    "I do not claim from you any reward for it. My reward is with none but with the Lord of the worlds.",
    "Do you go to the males (for having sex) out of the whole universe,",
    "and leave your wives whom your Lord has created for you? Indeed you are a people who cross (all) limits.”",
    "They said, “If you do not stop O LūT, you shall be included among the outcast.”",
    "He said “Indeed, I am annoyed with your act.",
    "My Lord, save me and my family from what they do.”",
    "So We saved him and his family, all of them",
    "except an old woman among those who remained behind.",
    "Then We destroyed the others,",
    "and subjected them to a terrible rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned.",
    "Surely, in this there is a sign, but most of them are not believers,",
    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "The people of Aaikah rejected the messengers",

    "Give full measure, and do not be among those who bring loss to others.",
    "Weigh with an even balance,",
    "and do not make people short of their things, and do not spread disorder in the land as mischief-makers,",
    "and be fearful of the One who created you and the former generations.”",
    "They said, “You are but one of the bewitched men.",
    "You are no more than a human like us, and in fact we consider you to be one of the liars.",
    "So cause a piece from the sky to fall down upon us, if you are one of the truthful.”",
    "He said, “My Lord knows well what you do.”",
    "Thus they rejected him, so they were seized by the torment of the Day of Canopy. Indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day.",

    "and indeed your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.",
    "This (Qur’ān) is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds.",
    "The Trusted Spirit has brought it down",
    "upon your heart, so that you become one of the warners",
    "in plain Arabic language.",
    "And of course, it is (mentioned) in the Scriptures of the former people.",
    "Is it not a proof for them that the knowledgeable of the children of Isrā’īl recognize him (the prophet)?",
    "Even if We had revealed it to a Non-Arab,",
    "and he had recited it to them, they would not have believed in it.",
    "This is how We have made it pass through the hearts of the sinners.",
    "They will not believe in it until they will see the painful punishment",
    "and it will come to them suddenly while they will not be anticipating (it),",
    "and (then) they will say, “Is it (possible) that we are given some respite?”",
    "Is it then Our punishment that they are trying to hasten up?",
    "So tell me, if We give them enjoyment for years,",
    "then comes to them what they are warned of,",
    "what help can they receive from the comforts they were given to enjoy?",
    "We did not destroy any town unless it has had warners",
    "to give advice, and We have never been unjust.",
    "And this (Qur’ān) is not brought down by devils.",
    "It neither suits them, nor are they able to (do this).",
    "In fact, they are kept far away from hearing (it at the time of revelation).",

    "Surely, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.",
    "Shall I tell you on whom the devils descend?",
    "They descend on every sinful liar.",
    "They give ear to hear (secretly,) and most of them tell lies.",
    "As for the poets, they are followed by the straying people.",
    "Did you not see that they wander in every valley,",
    "and that they say what they do not?",
    "Except those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah very much, and defend themselves after they are wronged. And the wrongdoers will soon know to which place they are going to return.",
    "Tā Sīn . These are the verses of the Qur’ān and an enlightening book,",
    "a guidance and good news to the believers",
    "who establish Salāh and pay Zakāh and who have faith in the Hereafter.",
    "As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds look beautiful to them. So they are wandering astray.",
    "Those are the people who deserve the worst punishment and who are the worst losers in the Hereafter.",
    "Indeed you are being given the Qur’ān by a Wise, Knowledgeable Being.",
    "(Remember) when Mūsā said to his family, “I have noticed a fire. I shall bring to you some news from it, or bring to you a live ember, so that you may warm yourselves.”",
    "So when he came to it, he was called: “Blessed is the one who is in the fire and the one who is around it. And pure is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.",
    "O Mūsā, the fact is that I AM ALLAH, the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "And cast your staff down.” So when he saw it moving, as if it was a snake, he retreated turning his back, and did not look behind. “O Mūsā, be not scared. I am such that the messengers are not scared before Me,",
    "except him who did wrong, then after (having done) evil, replaced (it) with good, then I am Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "And put your hand into your bosom, and it will come out white, without any evil, as one of the nine signs (sent) to Pharaoh and his people. Surely they have been a sinful people.",
    "So when Our signs came to them as eye-openers, they said, “This is a clear magic.”",
    "And they denied them out of sheer injustice and arrogance, though their hearts believed them (to be true). See, then, how was the fate of the mischief-makers.",
    "Surely We gave knowledge to Dāwūd and Sulaimān, and they said, “Praise belongs to Allah who made us excel many of His believing servants.",
    "And Sulaimān inherited (the traits of) Dāwūd and said, “O people we have been taught the speech of birds, and all sorts of things are given to us. Indeed, this is the evident grace (of Allah).”",
    "And mustered for Sulaimān were his forces from among the Jinns and the humans and the birds. So all of them were kept under (his) control,",
    "until when they reached the valley of the ants, one of the ants said, “O ants, enter your dwelling places, lest Sulaimān and his armies crush you unknowingly.”",
    "So he (Sulaimān) smiled, laughing on her speech and said, “My Lord, enable me to become grateful to Your favor that you have bestowed on me and on my parents, and to do good deeds that You like, and admit me, with Your mercy, among Your righteous servants.”",
    "And (once) he (Sulaimān) checked the birds and said, “How is it with me that I do not see the hudhud (hoopoe)? Rather he has disappeared.",
    "I will punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings to me a clear plea.”",
    "Then the hoopoe did not take long and said (to Sulaimān), “I have discovered what you did not, and have brought to you a sure information from Saba’ (Sheba).",
    "I have found a woman ruling over them, and all sorts of things are given to her, and she has a great throne.",
    "I have found her and her people prostrating themselves to the sun, instead of Allah, and the Satan has beautified their deeds for them, and has prevented them from the way, so they do not take the right path,",
    "that is, they do not prostrate to Allah who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,-and who knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal.”",
    "Allah! There is no god but He, the Lord of the Great Throne.",
    "He (Sulaimān) said, “We shall see whether you have told the truth or you are one of the liars.",
    "Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it down to them, then turn back from them, and see how they react.”",
    "She (the queen) said (to her officials after receiving the letter), “O chieftains, there has been delivered to me an esteemed letter.",
    "It is from Sulaimān, and it is (in the following words :) With the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Very-Merciful.",
    "Do not rebel against me, and come to me in submission.”",
    "She said, “O chieftains, advise me in the matter I have (before me). I am not the one who decides a matter absolutely unless you are present with me.”",
    "They said, “We are powerful and tough fighters, and the decision lies with you; so consider what command you should give.”",
    "She said, “In fact when the kings enter a town, they put it to disorder, and put its honorable citizens to disgrace, and this is how they normally do.",
    "And I am going to send a gift to them, then see, what response the envoys will bring back.”",
    "So when he (the envoy) came to Sulaimān, he said, “Are you extending a financial aid to me? So what Allah has given me is much better than what He has given to you. But you yourselves are proud of your gift.",
    "Go back to them, and we will bring to them forces they have no power to face, and we will certainly drive them out from there in humiliation while they are disgraced.”",
    "He said, “O chieftains, which one of you will bring her throne to me before they come to me submissively?”",
    "A stalwart of the Jinn said, “I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place, and for this (task) I am powerful, reliable.”",
    "Said the one who had the knowledge of the book, “I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.” So when he saw it (the throne) well placed before him, he said, “This is by the grace of my Lord, so that He may test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own benefit, and whoever is ungrateful, then my Lord is Need-Free, Bountiful”.",
    "He said, “Disguise the throne for her, and we will see whether she discovers the truth, or she does not recognize it.”",
    "So when she came, it was said (to her), “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It seems to be the same. We have been made to recognize the truth even before this, and we have already submitted.”",
    "And she was prevented (from submitting before this) by that which she used to worship instead of Allah. Indeed she was from a disbelieving people.",
    "It was said to her, “Enter the palace.” Then once she saw it, she thought it was flowing water, and uncovered her legs. He (Sulaimān) said, “This is a palace made of glasses.” She said, “My Lord, I had surely wronged myself, and now I submit, along with Sulaimān, to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.”",
    "And We sent to Thamūd their brother SāliH saying (to them), “Worship Allah”. Then suddenly they became two groups quarrelling with each other.",
    "He said, “My people, why do you seek evil to come sooner before good? Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah, so that you are treated with mercy?”",
    "They said, “We regard you and those with you as a sign of bad omen.” He said, “Your omen is with Allah, but you are a people put to a test.”",
    "And there were nine persons in the city who used to make mischief on the earth and did not put things right.",
    "They said, “Let us swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall attack him (SāliH) and his family at night, then will say to his heir, ‘We did not witness the destruction of his family, and we are really truthful.’”",
    "Thus they devised a plan, and We devised a plan, while they were not aware.",
    "So, look how was the fate of their plan, that We annihilated them and their people altogether.",
    "Now those are their houses, lying empty because of their transgression. Surely, in this there are signs for a people who have knowledge.",
    "And We saved those who believed and who used to be God-fearing.",
    "And (We sent) LūT when he said to his people, “Do you commit the shameful act while you can see (its shamefulness)?",
    "Is it that you really come to men lustfully instead of women? No, you are a people committing acts of ignorance.”",
    "So, the answer of his people was not else but that they said, “Expel the family of LūT from your town. They are a people who over-indulge in purity.”",
    "So, We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to remain among those who stayed behind.",
    "And We rained on them a rain. So evil was the rain of those who were warned.",
    "Say, “Praise belongs to Allah, and peace be on those of His servants whom He has chosen.” Is Allah better or that which they associate (with Him as His partners)?"
