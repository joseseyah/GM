    "The believers have indeed attained true success:",
    "those who, in their Prayers, humble themselves;",
    "who avoid whatever is vain and frivolous;",
    "who observe Zakah;",
    "who strictly guard their private parts",
    "save from their wives, or those whom their right hands possess; for with regard to them they are free from blame \"",
    "As for those who seek beyond that, they are transgressors\"",
    "who are true to their trusts and their covenants,",
    "and who guard their Prayers.",
    "Such are the inheritors",
    "that shall inherit Paradise; and in it they shall abide for ever.",
    "We created man out of the extract of clay,",
    "then We made him into a drop of life-germ, then We placed it in a safe depository,",
    "then We made this drop into a clot, then We made the clot into a lump, then We made the lump into bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We caused it to grow into another creation. Thus Most Blessed is Allah, the Best of all those that create.",
    "Thereafter you are destined to die,",
    "and then on the Day of Resurrection you shall certainly be raised up.",
    "We have indeed fashioned above you seven paths. Never were We unaware of the task of creation.",
    "We sent down water from the sky in right measure, and caused it to stay in the earth, and We have the power to cause it to vanish (in the manner We please).",
    "Then through water We caused gardens of date-palms and vines to grow for you wherein you have an abundance of delicious fruits and from them you derive your livelihood.",
    "And We also produced the tree which springs forth from Mount Sinai, containing oil and sauce for those that eat.",
    "And indeed there is also a lesson for you in cattle. We provide you with drink out of what they have in their bellies; and you have many other benefits in them: you eat of them,",
    "and are carried on them and also on ships.",
    "We sent Noah to his people, and he said: \"My people! Serve Allah; you have no deity other than He. Do you have no fear?\"",
    "But the notables among his people had refused to believe, and said: \"This is none other than a mortal like yourselves who desires to attain superiority over you. Had Allah wanted (to send any Messengers) He would have sent down angels. We have heard nothing like this in the time of our forebears of old (that humans were sent as Messengers).",
    "He is a person who has been seized with a little madness; so wait for a while (perhaps he will improve).\"",
    "Noah said: \"My Lord! Come to my help at their accusation that I am lying.\"",
    "Thereupon We revealed to him, saying: \"Build the Ark under Our eyes and according to Our revelation. And when Our command comes to pass and the oven boils over, take on board a pair each from every species, and also take your household except those of them against whom sentence has already been passed and do not plead to Me on behalf of the wrong-doers. They are doomed to be drowned.",
    "And then when you and those accompanying you are firmly seated in the Ark, say: \"Thanks be to Allah Who has delivered us from the wrong-doing people.\"",
    "And say: \"My Lord! Make my landing a blessed landing, for You are the Best of those Who can cause people to land in safety.\"",
    "There are great Signs in this story; and surely We do put people to test.",
    "Then, after them, We brought forth another generation;",
    "and We sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, saying: \"Serve Allah; you have no god other than He. Do you have no fear?\"",
    "The notables among his people who had refused to believe and who denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and those whom We had endowed with ease and comfort in this life, cried out: \"This is no other than a mortal like yourselves who eats what you eat and drinks what you drink.",
    "If you were to obey a human being like yourselves, you will certainly be losers.",
    "Does he promise you that when you are dead and are reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth to life?",
    "Far-fetched, utterly far-fetched is what you are being promised.",
    "There is no other life than the life of the world. We shall live here and here shall we die; and we are not going to be raised again.",
    "This man has forged a mere lie in the name of Allah and we shall never believe what he says.\"",
    "The Messenger said: \"My Lord! Come to my help at their accusing me of lying.\"",
    "He answered: \"A short while, and they shall be repenting.\"",
    "Then a mighty blast quite justly overtook them, and We reduced them to a rubble. So away with the wrong-doing folk!",
    "Then, after them, We brought forth other generations.",
    "No nation can outstrip its term, nor can it put it back.",
    "Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Whenever a Messenger came to his people they rejected him, calling him a liar. Thereupon, We made each people to follow the other (to its doom), reducing them to mere tales (of the past). Scourged be the people who do not believe!",
    "Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our Signs and a clear authority",
    "to Pharaoh and to his chiefs, but they behaved superciliously and they were haughty.",
    "They said: \"Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves when their people are slaves to us?\"",
    "So they rejected them, calling them liars, and they too eventually became of those that were destroyed.",
    "And We gave Moses the Book that people might be guided by it.",
    "And We made Mary's son, and his mother, a Sign, and We gave them refuge on a lofty ground, a peaceful site with springs flowing in it.",
    "Messengers! Partake of the things that are clean, and act righteously. I know well all that you do.",
    "This community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord; so hold Me alone in fear.",
    "But people later cut up their religion into bits, each group rejoicing in what they have.",
    "So leave them immersed in their heedlessness till an appointed time.",
    "Do they fancy that Our continuing to give them wealth and children (means) that",
    "We are busy lavishing on them all kinds of good? Nay, they do not perceive the reality of the matter.",
    "Surely those who stand in awe for fear of their Lord,",
    "who have full faith in the Signs of their Lord;",
    "who associate none with their Lord in His Divinity,",
    "who give, whatever they give in charity, with their hearts trembling at the thought that they are destined to return to their Lord;",
    "it is these who hasten to do good works and vie in so doing with one another.",
    "We do not lay a burden on anyone beyond his capacity. We have a Book with Us that speaks the truth(about everyone); and they shall in no wise be wronged.",
    "Nay, their hearts are lost in ignorance of all this; and their deeds too vary from the way (mentioned above). They will persist in these deeds",
    "until We seize with Our chastisement those of them that are given to luxuriant ways. They will then begin to groan.",
    "\"Put a stop to your groaning now! Surely no help shall be provided to you from Us.",
    "My Signs were rehearsed to you and you turned back on your heels and took to flight,",
    "behaving arrogantly, and making fun, and talking nonsense (about the Book in your nightly chats).\"",
    "Did they never ponder over this Word (of God)? Or has he (to wit, the Messenger) brought something the like of which did not come to their forefathers of yore?",
    "Or is it that they were unaware of their Messenger and were therefore repelled by him for he was a stranger to them?",
    "Or do they say that there is madness in him? Nay, he has brought them the Truth and it is the Truth that most of them disdain.",
    "Were the Truth to follow their desires, the order of the heavens and the earth and those who dwell in them would have been ruined. Nay, the fact is that We have brought to them their own remembrance; and yet it is from their own remembrance that they are turning away.",
    "Are you asking them for something? What Allah has given you is the best. He is the Best of providers.",
    "You are calling them to a Straight Way,",
    "but those who do not believe in the Hereafter are ever prone to deviate from the Right Way.",
    "Were We to be merciful to them and remove from them their present afflictions, they would persist in their transgression, blindly wandering on.",
    "(They are such) that We seized them with chastisement (and yet) they did not humble themselves before their Lord, nor do they entreat",
    "until We opened upon them the door of a severe chastisement. Then lo, in this state they become utterly despaired of any good.",
    "It is He Who has endowed you with the faculties of hearing and sight and has given you hearts (to think). Scarcely do you give thanks.",
    "It is He Who has dispersed you all around the earth, and it is unto Him that you shall all be mustered.",
    "It is He Who gives life and causes death, and He holds mastery over the alternation of night and day. Do you not understand this?",
    "Nay, but they say the like of what their predecessors of yore had said.",
    "They say: \"Is it that when we are dead and have been reduced to dust and bones, shall we then be raised up again?",
    "We were promised such things and so were our forefathers before us. All these are no more than tales of the past.\"",
    "Ask them: \"Whose is the earth and those who are in it? Tell us if you know\"",
    "They will surely say: \"Allah's.\" Say: \"Then why do you not take heed?\"",
    "Ask them: \"Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, the Lord of the Great Throne?\"",
    "They will surely say: \"Allah.\" Say: \"Will you not, then, fear (Allah)?\"",
    "Ask them: \"Say, if you indeed know, to whom belongs the dominion over all things; (Who is it) that grants asylum, but against Whom no asylum is available?\"",
    "They will surely say: \"(The dominion over all things) belongs to Allah.\" Say: \"Whence are you then deluded?\"",
    "We have brought before them the Truth, and there is no doubt that they are lying.",
    "Never did Allah take unto Himself any son, nor is there any god other than He. (Had there been any other gods) each god would have taken his creatures away with him, and each would have rushed to overpower the other. Glory be to Allah from all that they characterize Him with!",
    "He knows both what is visible and what is not visible. Exalted is Allah above all that they associate with Him.",
    "Pray, (O Muhammad): \"My Lord, if You should bring the scourge of which they had been warned in my presence,",
    "then do not include me, my Lord, among these wrong-doing people.\"",
    "Surely We are able to show you what We warn them against.",
    "(O Muhammad)! Repel evil in the best manner. We are well aware of all that they say about you.",
    "And pray: \"My Lord! I seek Your refuge from the suggestions of the evil ones;",
    "I even seek Your refuge, my Lord, lest they should approach me.\"",
    "(They shall persist in their deeds) until when death comes to anyone of them he will say: \"My Lord, send me back to the world",
    "that I have left behind. I am likely to do good.\" Nay, it is merely a word that he is uttering. There is a barrier behind all of them (who are dead) until the Day when they will be raised up.",
    "And then no sooner the Trumpet is blown than there will remain no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask one another.",
    "It will be an Hour when those whose scales are heavy, they alone will attain success;",
    "and those whose scales are light, those will be the ones who will have courted loss. They will abide in Hell.",
    "The Fire shall scorch their faces, exposing their jaws.",
    "\"Are you not those to whom My revelations were recited, and you dubbed them as lies?\"",
    "They will say: \"Our Lord! Our misfortune prevailed over us. We were indeed an erring people.",
    "Our Lord! Take us out of this. Then if we revert (to evil-doing) we shall indeed be wrongdoers.\"",
    "Allah will say: \"Away from Me; stay where you are and do not address Me.",
    "You are those that when a party of My servants said: 'Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us, and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those that are merciful,'",
    "you made a laughingstock of them and your hostility to them caused you to forget Me, and you simply kept laughing.",
    "Lo! I have rewarded them this Day for their steadfastness, so that they, and they alone, are triumphant.\"",
    "Then Allah will ask them: \"For how many years did you stay on earth?\"",
    "They will say: \"We stayed for a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep count of this.\"",
    "He will say: \"You stayed only for a while, if you only knew that.",
    "Did you imagine that We created you without any purpose, and that you will not be brought back to Us?\"",
    "So, exalted be Allah, the True King! There is no god but He, the Lord of the Great Throne.",
    "He who invokes any other god along with Allah \" one for whom he has no evidence\" his reckoning is with his Lord alone. Indeed, these unbelievers shall not prosper.",
    "And say, (O Muhammad): \"My Lord, forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the Best of those that are merciful.\"",
    "This is a surah which We have revealed, and which We have made obligatory; We have revealed in it clear instructions so that you may take heed.",
    "Those who fornicate - whether female or male - flog each one of them with a hundred lashes. And let not tenderness for them deter you from what pertains to Allah's religion, if you do truly believe in Allah and the Last Day; and let a party of believers witness their punishment.",
    "Let the fornicator not marry any except a fornicatress or idolatress and let the fornicatress not marry any except a fornicator or an idolater. That is forbidden to the believers.",
    "Those who accuse honourable women (of unchastity) but do not produce four witnesses, flog them with eighty lashes, and do not admit their testimony ever after. They are indeed transgressors,",
    "except those of them that repent thereafter and mend their behaviour. For surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever Compassionate.",
    "As for those who accuse their wives (of unchastity), and have no witnesses except themselves: the testimony of such a one is that he testify, swearing by Allah four times, that he is truthful (in his accusation),",
    "and a fifth time, that the curse of Allah be on him if he be lying (in his accusation).",
    "And the punishment shall be averted from the woman if she were to testify, swearing by Allah four times that the man was lying,",
    "and a fifth time that the wrath of Allah be on her if the man be truthful (in his accusation).",
    "Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you and that Allah is much prone to accept repentance and is Wise, (you would have landed yourselves into great difficulty on the question of unsubstantiated accusation of your spouses).",
    "Surely those who invented this calumny are a band from among you. Do not deem this incident an evil for you; nay, it is good for you. Every one of them has accumulated sin in proportion to his share in this guilt; and he who has the greater part of it shall suffer a mighty chastisement.",
    "When you heard of it, why did the believing men and women not think well of their own folk and say: \"This is a manifest calumny?\"",
    "Why did they not bring four witnesses in support of their accusation? Now that they have brought no witnesses, it is indeed they who are liars in the sight of Allah.",
    "Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you in the world and in the Hereafter a grievous chastisement would have seized you on account of what you indulged in.",
    "(Just think, how wrong you were) when one tongue received it from another and you uttered with your mouths something you knew nothing about. You deemed it to be a trifle while in the sight of Allah it was a serious matter.",
    "And why, no sooner than you had heard it, did you not say: \"It becomes us not even to utter such a thing? Holy are You (O Allah)! This is a mighty calumny.\"",
    "Allah admonishes you: If you are true believers, never repeat the like of what you did.",
    "Allah clearly expounds to you His instructions. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "Verily those who love that indecency should spread among the believers deserve a painful chastisement in the world and the Hereafter. Allah knows, but you do not know.",
    "Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you, and that Allah is Most Forgiving and Wise, (the evil that had been spread among you would have led to terrible consequences).",
    "Believers! Do not follow in Satan's footsteps. Let him who follows in Satan's footsteps (remember that) Satan bids people to indecency and evil. Were it not for Allah's Bounty and His Mercy unto you, not one of you would have ever attained purity. But Allah enables whomsoever He wills to attain purity. Allah is All- Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "Let those among you who are bounteous and resourceful not swear to withhold giving to the kindred, to the needy, and to those who have forsaken their homes in the cause of Allah; rather, let them forgive and forbear. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "Those that accuse chaste, unwary, believing women, have been cursed in the world and the Hereafter, and a mighty chastisement awaits them.",
    "(Let them not be heedless of) the Day when their own tongues, their hands, and their feet shall all bear witness against them as to what they have been doing.a",
    "On that Day Allah will justly requite them, and they will come to know that Allah - and He alone - is the Truth, the One Who makes the Truth manifest.",
    "Corrupt women are for corrupt men, and corrupt men for corrupt women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women. They are innocent of the calumnies people utter. There shall be forgiveness for them and a generous provision.",
    "Believers! Enter not houses other than your own houses until you have obtained the permission of the inmates of those houses and have greeted them with peace. This is better for you. It is expected that you will observe this.",
    "Then if you find no one in them, do not enter until you have been given permission (to enter). And if you are told to go back, then do go back. This is a purer way for you. Allah knows all what you do.",
    "However, it is not blameworthy for you if you enter houses that are uninhabited but wherein there is something of use to you. Allah is well aware of what you disclose and what you conceal.",
    "(O Prophet), enjoin believing men to cast down their looks and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is well aware of all what they do.",
    "And enjoin believing women to cast down their looks and guard their private parts and not reveal their adornment except that which is revealed of itself, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their husbands, or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or of their own sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or the women with whom they associate, or those that are in their bondage, or the male attendants in their service free of sexual interest, or boys that are yet unaware of illicit matters pertaining to women. Nor should they stamp their feet on the ground in such manner that their hidden ornament becomes revealed. Believers, turn together, all of you, to Allah in repentance that you may attain true success.",
    "Marry those of you that are single, (whether men or women), and those of your male and female slaves that are righteous. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them out of His Bounty. Allah is Immensely Resourceful, All-Knowing.",
    "Let those who cannot afford to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His Bounty. And write out a deed of manumission for such of your slaves that desire their freedom in lieu of payment - if you see any good in them - and give them out of the wealth that Allah has given you. And do not compel your slave-girls to prostitution for the sake of the benefits of worldly life the while they desire to remain chaste. And if anyone compels them to prostitution, Allah will be Most Pardoning, Much Merciful (to them) after their subjection to such compulsion.",
    "Verily We have sent down for you revelations which clearly expound true guidance, and examples of those who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who fear (Allah).",
    "Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His Light (in the Universe) may be likened to a niche wherein is a lamp, and the lamp is in the crystal which shines in star-like brilliance. It is lit from (the oil) of a blessed olive tree that is neither eastern nor western. Its oil well nigh glows forth (of itself) though no fire touched it: Light upon Light. Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. Allah sets forth parables to make people understand. Allah knows everything.",
    "(Those who are directed to this Light are found) in houses which Allah has allowed to be raised and wherein His name is to be remembered: in them people glorify Him in the morning and in the evening,",
    "people whom neither commerce nor striving after profit diverts them from remembering Allah, from establishing Prayer, and from paying Zakah; people who dread the Day on which all hearts will be overturned and eyes will be petrified;",
    "(people who do all this so) that Allah may reward them in accordance with the best that they did; indeed He will bestow upon them more out of His Bounty, for Allah grants whomsoever He wills beyond all measure.",
    "But for those who deny the Truth, their deeds are like a mirage in the desert, which the thirsty supposes to be water until he comes to it only to find that it was nothing; he found instead that Allah was with Him and He paid his account in full. Allah is swift in settling the account.",
    "Or its similitude is that of depths of darkness upon an abysmal sea, covered by a billow, above which is a billow, above which is cloud, creating darkness piled one upon another; when he puts forth his hand, he would scarcely see it. He to whom Allah assigns no light, he will have no light.",
    "Do you not see that all that is in the heavens and the earth, even the birds that go about spreading their wings in flight, extol His glory? Each knows the way of its prayer and of its extolling Allah's glory. Allah is well aware of whatever they do.",
    "Allah's is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to Him are all destined to return.",
    "Do you not see that it is Allah Who gently drives the clouds, then He joins them together and then turns them into a thick mass and thereafter you see rain-drops fall down from its midst? And then He sends down hail from the heaven - thanks to the mountains - and causes it to smite whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of His lightning almost takes away the sight.",
    "It is Allah Who alternates the night and the day. Surely there is a lesson in it for those that have sight.",
    "Allah has created every animal from water. Of them some move on their bellies, some move on two legs and some on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah has power over everything.",
    "Verily We have sent down revelations that clearly explain the Truth. Allah guides whomsoever He wills to a Straight Way.",
    "They say: \"We believe in Allah and the Messenger, and we obey,\" but thereafter a faction of them turns away (from obedience). These indeed are not believers.",
    "When they are called to Allah and His Messenger that he (that is, the Messenger) may judge (the disputes) among them, a faction of them turns away.",
    "However if the right is on their side they come to him (professing) their submissiveness.",
    "Do their hearts suffer from the disease (of hypocrisy)? Or have they fallen prey to doubts? Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will wrong them? Nay, the truth is that they themselves are wrong-doers.",
    "When those that believe are called to Allah and His Messenger in order that he (that is, the Messenger) may judge their disputes among them, nothing becomes them but to say: \"We hear and we obey.\" Such shall attain true success.",
    "Those who obey Allah and His Messenger and fear Him and avoid disobeying Him: such, indeed, shall triumph.",
    "(The hypocrites) solemnly swear by Allah: \"If you order us, we shall surely go forth (and fight in the cause of Allah).\" Tell them: \"Do not swear. The state of your obedience is known. Allah is well aware of all that you do.\"",
    "Say: \"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then (know well) that the Messenger is responsible for what he has been charged with and you are responsible for what you have been charged with. But if you obey him, you will be guided to the Right Way. The Messenger has no other responsibility but to clearly convey (the command).\"",
    "Allah has promised those of you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely bestow power on them in the land even as He bestowed power on those that preceded them, and that He will firmly establish their religion which He has been pleased to choose for them, and He will replace with security the state of fear that they are in. Let them serve Me and associate none with Me in My Divinity. Whoso thereafter engages in unbelief, such indeed are the ungodly.",
    "Establish Prayer and pay Zakah and obey the Messenger so that mercy may be shown to you.",
    "Do not even imagine that those who disbelieve can render Allah powerless in the land. Their abode is the Fire; what an evil abode!",
    "Believers! At three times let those whom your right hands possess and those of your children who have not yet reached puberty ask leave of you before entering your quarters: before the Morning Prayer and when you take off your clothes at noon, and after the Night Prayer. These are the three times of privacy for you. If they come to you at other times then there is no sin for them nor for you, for you have to visit one another frequently. Thus does Allah clearly explain His directives to you. Allah is All- Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "And when your children attain puberty let them ask leave to come to you like their elders used to ask leave. Thus does Allah clearly explain to you His Signs. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "The women who are past their youth (and can no longer bear children) and do not look forward to marriage will incur no sin if they cast off their outer garments without displaying their adornment. But if they remain modest, that is still better for them. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "There is no blame on the blind nor any blame on the lame nor any blame on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers or the houses of your fathers' sisters, or in the houses of your mothers' brothers, or in the houses of your mothers' sisters or in the houses whose keys you possess, or the house of a friend. There is no blame if you eat together or separately. But when you enter such houses, greet each other with a salutation appointed by Allah, a salutation that is blessed and good. Thus, does Allah expound His signs to you in order that you will act with understanding.",
    "The true believers are only those who sincerely believe in Allah and in His Messenger and who, whenever they are with him on some common errand, they do not go away until they have asked leave of him. Verily those who ask leave of you, it is they who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. So if they ask your leave in connection with some of their affairs, give leave to those whom you will, and ask Allah for forgiveness on their behalf. Surely Allah is Much Forgiving, Ever Merciful.",
    "(Muslims!) Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you as your calling one another. Allah knows well those of you who surreptitiously steal away, taking shelter behind one another. Let those who go against the order (of the Messenger) beware lest a trial or severe punishment afflict them.",
    "Lo! Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He is well aware of your ways. And the Day when they will be returned to Him, He will tell them all what they did. Allah knows everything.",
    "Most blessed is He Who sent down this Criterion on His servant, to be a warner to all mankind;",
    "He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; Who has taken to Himself no son nor has He taken any partner in His kingdom; Who created everything and then determined its destiny.",
    "Yet people have taken, instead of Him, other deities; those that create nothing but are themselves created; who do not have the power to hurt or benefit even themselves; who have no power over death, nor over life, nor over the resurrection of the dead.",
    "Those who disbelieve in the Message of the Prophet say: \"This (Criterion) is nothing but a lie which he has forged with the help of others.\" Such have indeed resorted to a grievous wrong and sheer falsehood.",
    "They say: \"These are merely fairy tales of the ancients which he has got inscribed and they are then recited to him morning and evening.\"",
    "Say to them (O Muhammad): \"It is He Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth Who has sent down this Book. Indeed, He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate.\"",
    "They say: \"What sort of a Messenger is this: he eats food and walks about in the markets? Why was an angel not sent down to him so that he may remain with the Messenger and warn those that do not believe in him?",
    "Why was a treasure not bestowed upon him, or a garden whereof he might obtain his sustenance?\" The evil-doers say: \"You are simply following a bewitched man.\"",
    "See what specious arguments they put forth before you: they are so strayed that they will not find their way to anything sound.",
    "Most blessed is He Who, if He wills, can grant you even better than what they propose: Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and stately mansions.",
    "Nay, the truth is that it is the Hour  to which they give the lie.; We have kept a Blazing Fire ready for him who denies the Hour.",
    "When it sees them from a place afar, they will hear its raging and roaring,",
    "and when they are flung, chained together, into a narrow place in it, they will fervently call there for annihilation.",
    "(They will then be told): \"Do not call for a single annihilation, but for many an annihilation.\"",
    "Ask them: \"Is this state better or the Garden of Eternity which the God-fearing have been promised?\" It shall be their recompense and the end-point of their journey;",
    "the Garden wherein whatever they desire will be fulfilled. In it they shall abide for ever. This is a promise whose fulfilment Your Lord has made incumbent on Himself.",
    "On the Day when He will muster together all the unbelievers as well as the deities that they worship beside Allah, and He will ask them: \"Was it you who caused these servants of Mine to stray away, or did they themselves stray away from the Right Path?\"",
    "They will say: \"Glory be to You! It did not behove us to take any other than You as our guardians, but You lavished the pleasures of life upon them and their forefathers until they forgot the Admonition and became doomed to destruction.\"",
    "Thus will those deities give the lie to all what you now say, and you will not be able to avert your doom, nor obtain any succour. We shall cause whoever of you commits wrong to taste an enormous chastisement.",
    "(O Muhammad), We never sent any Messengers before you but they ate food and walked about in the markets. We made some of you a means to test each by the other to see whether you remain patient. Your Lord is All-Seeing."
