    "What are they asking about?",
    "The momentous announcement",
    "about which they differ.",
    "They will find out.",
    "In the end they will find out.",
    "Did We not make the earth smooth,",
    "and make the mountains to keep it stable?",
    "Did We not create you in pairs,",
    "give you sleep for rest,",
    "the night as a cover,",
    "and the day for your livelihood?",
    "Did We not build seven strong [heavens] above you,",
    "and make a blazing lamp?",
    "Did We not send water pouring down from the clouds",
    "to bring forth with it grain, plants,",
    "and luxuriant gardens?",
    "A time has been appointed for the Day of Decision:",
    "a Day when the Trumpet will sound and you will come forward in crowds,",
    "when the sky will open up like wide portals,",
    "when the mountains will vanish like a mirage.",
    "Hell lies in wait,",
    "a home for oppressors",
    "to stay in for a long, long time,",
    "where they will taste no coolness nor drink",
    "except one that is scalding and dark––",
    "a fitting requital,",
    "for they did not fear a reckoning,",
    "and they rejected Our messages as lies.",
    "We have recorded everything in a Record.",
    "‘Taste this: all you will get from Us is more torment.’",
    "For those who were aware of God there is supreme fulfilment:",
    "private gardens, vineyards,",
    "nubile, well-matched companions,",
    "and an overflowing cup.",
    "There they will hear no vain or lying talk:",
    "a reward from your Lord, a fitting gift",
    "from the Lord of the heavens and earth and everything between, the Lord of Mercy. They will have no authority from Him to speak.",
    "On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in rows, they will not speak except for those to whom the Lord of Mercy gives permission, who will say only what is right.",
    "That is the Day of Truth. So whoever wishes to do so should take the path that leads to his Lord.",
    "We have warned you of imminent torment, on the Day when every person will see what their own hands have sent ahead for them, when the disbeliever will say, ‘If only I were dust!’"
