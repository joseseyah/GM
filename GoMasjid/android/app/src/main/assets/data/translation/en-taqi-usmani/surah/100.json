    "(I swear) by those (horses) that run snorting,",

    "then raise, at the same time, a trail of dust,",
    "then enter, at the same time, into the centre of the (opposing) host,",
    "man is, indeed, very ungrateful to his Lord,",
    "and he himself is a witness to that fact,",
    "and in his love for wealth, he is very intense.",
    "Does he not then know (what will happen) when all that is contained in the graves will be overturned,",
    "and all that is contained in the hearts will be exposed.",
    "Surely your Lord, that day, is fully aware of them."
