    "Successful indeed are the believers:",
    "those who humble themselves in prayer;",
    "those who avoid idle talk;",
    "those who pay alms-tax;",
    "those who guard their chastity",
    "except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame,",
    "but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors;",
    "˹the believers are also˺ those who are true to their trusts and covenants;",
    "and those who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers.",
    "These are the ones who will be awarded",
    "Paradise as their own. They will be there forever.",
    "And indeed, We created humankind from an extract of clay,",
    "then placed each ˹human˺ as a sperm-drop in a secure place,",
    "then We developed the drop into a clinging clot, then developed the clot into a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.",
    "After that you will surely die,",
    "then on the Day of Judgment you will be resurrected.",
    "And indeed, We created above you seven levels ˹of heaven˺. We are never unmindful of ˹Our˺ creation.",
    "We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away.",
    "With it We produce for you gardens of palm trees and grapevines, in which there are abundant fruits, and from which you may eat,",
    "as well as ˹olive˺ trees which grow at Mount Sinai, providing oil and a condiment to eat.",
    "And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle, from whose bellies We give you ˹milk˺ to drink, and in them are many other benefits for you, and from them you may eat.",
    "And you are carried upon ˹some of˺ them and upon ships.",
    "Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He declared, “O my people! Worship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”",
    "But the disbelieving chiefs of his people said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you, who wants to be superior to you. Had Allah willed, He could have easily sent down angels ˹instead˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.",
    "He is simply insane, so bear with him for a while.” ",
    "Noah prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.”",
    "So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions. Then when Our command comes and the oven bursts ˹with water˺, take on board a pair from every species along with your family—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been passed. And do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”",
    "Then when you and those with you have settled in the Ark, say, “All praise is for Allah, Who saved us from the wrongdoing people.”",
    "And pray, “My Lord! Allow me a blessed landing, for You are the best accommodator.”",
    "Surely in this are lessons. And We ˹always˺ put ˹people˺ to the test.",
    "Then We raised another generation after them,",
    "and sent to them a messenger from among themselves, ˹declaring,˺ “Worship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”",
    "But the chiefs of his people—who disbelieved, denied the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter, and were spoiled by the worldly luxuries We had provided for them—said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you. He eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink.",
    "And if you ˹ever˺ obey a human like yourselves, then you would certainly be losers.",
    "Does he promise you that once you are dead and reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth ˹alive˺?",
    "Impossible, simply impossible is what you are promised!",
    "There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die, others are born, and none will be resurrected.",
    "He is no more than a man who has fabricated a lie about Allah, and we will never believe in him.”",
    "The messenger prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.”",
    "Allah responded, “Soon they will be truly regretful.”",
    "Then the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them with justice, and We reduced them to rubble. So away with the wrongdoing people!",
    "Then We raised other generations after them.",
    "No people can advance their doom, nor can they delay it.",
    "Then We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to his people, they denied him. So We destroyed them, one after the other, reducing them to ˹cautionary˺ tales. So away with the people who refuse to believe!",
    "Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and compelling proof",
    "to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a tyrannical people.",
    "They argued, “Will we believe in two humans, like ourselves, whose people are slaves to us?”",
    "So they rejected them both, and ˹so˺ were among those destroyed.",
    "And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so perhaps his people would be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
    "And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them refuge on high ground—a ˹suitable˺ place for rest with flowing water.",
    "O messengers! Eat from what is good and lawful, and act righteously. Indeed, I fully know what you do.",
    "Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺.",
    "Yet the people have divided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have.",
    "So leave them ˹O Prophet˺ in their heedlessness for a while.",
    "Do they think, since We provide them with wealth and children,",
    "that We hasten to ˹honour˺ them ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware.",
    "Surely those who tremble in awe of their Lord,",
    "and who believe in the revelations of their Lord,",
    "and who associate none with their Lord,",
    "and who do whatever ˹good˺ they do with their hearts fearful, ˹knowing˺ that they will return to their Lord—",
    "it is they who race to do good deeds, always taking the lead.",
    "We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None will be wronged.",
    "But the hearts of those ˹who disbelieve˺ are oblivious to ˹all of˺ this, and they have other ˹evil˺ deeds, opposite to this, in which they are engrossed.",
    "But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help.",
    "˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry for help today. Surely you will never be saved from Us.",
    "Indeed, My revelations were recited to you, but you used to back away ˹in disgust˺,",
    "boasting of the Sacred House, and babbling ˹nonsense about the Quran˺ by night.”",
    "Is it because they have never contemplated the Word ˹of Allah˺? Or ˹because˺ there has come to them something that did not come to their forefathers?",
    "Or ˹because˺ they failed to recognize their Messenger, and so they denied him?",
    "Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth.",
    "Had the truth followed their desires, the heavens, the earth, and all those in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have brought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it.",
    "Or ˹is it because˺ you ˹O Prophet˺ are asking them for tribute? But the reward of your Lord is best, for He is the Best Provider.",
    "And surely you are calling them to the Straight Path,",
    "but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are certainly deviating from that Path.",
    "˹Even˺ if We had mercy on them and removed their affliction, they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.",
    "And We have already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺.",
    "But as soon as We open for them a gate of severe punishment, they will be utterly desperate.",
    "He is the One Who created for you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.",
    "And He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.",
    "And He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of the day and night. Will you not then understand?",
    "But they ˹just˺ say what their predecessors said.",
    "They said, “Once we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected?",
    "We have already been promised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!”",
    "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “To whom belong the earth and all those on it, if you ˹really˺ know?”",
    "They will reply, “To Allah!” Say, “Why are you not then mindful?”",
    "˹And˺ ask ˹them˺, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?”",
    "They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”",
    "Ask ˹them also,˺ “In Whose Hands is the authority over all things, protecting ˹all˺ while none can protect against Him, if you ˹really˺ know?”",
    "They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “How are you then so deluded?”",
    "In fact, We have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars.",
    "Allah has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim!",
    "˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Should You show me what they are threatened with,",
    "then, my Lord, do not count me among the wrongdoing people.”",
    "We are indeed able to show you what We have threatened them with.",
    "Respond to evil with what is best. We know well what they claim.",
    "And say, “My Lord! I seek refuge in You from the temptations of the devils.",
    "And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, that they ˹even˺ come near me.”",
    "When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go back,",
    "so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a ˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day they are resurrected. ",
    "Then, when the Trumpet will be blown, there will be no kinship between them on that Day, nor will they ˹even care to˺ ask about one another. ",
    "As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who will be successful.",
    "But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever.",
    "The Fire will burn their faces, leaving them deformed.",
    "˹It will be said,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, but you used to deny them?”",
    "They will cry, “Our Lord! Our ill-fate took hold of us, so we became a misguided people.",
    "Our Lord! Take us out of this ˹Fire˺. Then if we ever return ˹to denial˺, we will truly be wrongdoers.”",
    "Allah will respond, “Be despised in there! Do not ˹ever˺ plead with Me ˹again˺!",
    "Indeed, there was a group of My servants who used to pray, ‘Our Lord! We have believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of those who show mercy,’",
    "but you were ˹so busy˺ making fun of them that it made you forget My remembrance. And you used to laugh at them.",
    "Today I have indeed rewarded them for their perseverance: they are certainly the triumphant.”",
    "He will ask ˹them˺, “How many years did you remain on earth?”",
    "They will reply, “We remained ˹only˺ a day or part of a day. But ask those who kept count.”",
    "He will say, “You only remained for a little while, if only you knew.",
    "Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?”",
    "Exalted is Allah, the True King! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Honourable Throne.",
    "Whoever invokes, besides Allah, another god—for which they can have no proof—they will surely find their penalty with their Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will never succeed.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the best of those who show mercy.”",
    "˹This is˺ a sûrah which We have revealed and made ˹its rulings˺ obligatory, and revealed in it clear commandments so that you may be mindful.",
    "As for female and male fornicators, give each of them one hundred lashes, and do not let pity for them make you lenient in ˹enforcing˺ the law of Allah, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a number of believers witness their punishment.",
    "A male fornicator would only marry a female fornicator or idolatress. And a female fornicator would only be married to a fornicator or idolater. This is ˹all˺ forbidden to the believers.",
    "Those who accuse chaste women ˹of adultery˺ and fail to produce four witnesses, give them eighty lashes ˹each˺. And do not ever accept any testimony from them—for they are indeed the rebellious—",
    "except those who repent afterwards and mend their ways, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "And those who accuse their wives ˹of adultery˺ but have no witness except themselves, the accuser must testify, swearing four times by Allah that he is telling the truth,",
    "and a fifth oath that Allah may condemn him if he is lying.",
    "For her to be spared the punishment, she must swear four times by Allah that he is telling a lie,",
    "and a fifth oath that Allah may be displeased with her if he is telling the truth.",
    "˹You would have suffered,˺ had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and had Allah not been Accepting of Repentance, All-Wise.",
    "Indeed, those who came up with that ˹outrageous˺ slander are a group of you. Do not think this is bad for you. Rather, it is good for you. They will be punished, each according to their share of the sin. As for their mastermind, he will suffer a tremendous punishment.",
    "If only the believing men and women had thought well of one another, when you heard this ˹rumour˺, and said, “This is clearly ˹an outrageous˺ slander!”",
    "Why did they not produce four witnesses? Now, since they have failed to produce witnesses, they are ˹truly˺ liars in the sight of Allah.",
    "Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and the Hereafter, you would have certainly been touched with a tremendous punishment for what you plunged into—",
    "when you passed it from one tongue to the other, and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, taking it lightly while it is ˹extremely˺ serious in the sight of Allah.",
    "If only you had said upon hearing it, “How can we speak about such a thing! Glory be to You ˹O Lord˺! This is a heinous slander!”",
    "Allah forbids you from ever doing something like this again, if you are ˹true˺ believers.",
    "And Allah makes ˹His˺ commandments clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "Indeed, those who love to see indecency spread among the believers will suffer a painful punishment in this life and the Hereafter. Allah knows and you do not know.",
    "˹You would have suffered,˺ had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and had Allah not been Ever Gracious, Most Merciful.",
    "O believers! Do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Whoever follows Satan’s footsteps, then ˹let them know that˺ he surely bids ˹all to˺ immorality and wickedness. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, none of you would have ever been purified. But Allah purifies whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "Do not let the people of virtue and affluence among you swear to suspend donations to their relatives, the needy, and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love to be forgiven by Allah? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. ",
    "Surely those who accuse chaste, unsuspecting, believing women are cursed in this life and the Hereafter. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment",
    "on the Day their tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them for what they used to do.",
    "On that Day, Allah will give them their just penalty in full, and they will ˹come to˺ know that Allah ˹alone˺ is the Ultimate Truth.",
    "Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked women. And virtuous women are for virtuous men, and virtuous men are for virtuous women. The virtuous are innocent of what the wicked say. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision. ",
    "O believers! Do not enter any house other than your own until you have asked for permission and greeted its occupants. This is best for you, so perhaps you will be mindful.",
    "If you find no one at home, do not enter it until you have been given permission. And if you are asked to leave, then leave. That is purer for you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of what you do.",
    "There is no blame on you if you enter public places where there is something of benefit for you. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal.",
    "˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do.",
    "And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, their fellow women, those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, male attendants with no desire, or children who are still unaware of women’s nakedness. Let them not stomp their feet, drawing attention to their hidden adornments. Turn to Allah in repentance all together, O  believers, so that you may be successful.",
    "Marry off the ˹free˺ singles among you, as well as the righteous of your bondmen and bondwomen. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them out of His bounty. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",
    "And let those who do not have the means to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His bounty. And if any of those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession desires a contract ˹to buy their own freedom˺, make it possible for them, if you find goodness in them. And give them some of Allah’s wealth which He has granted you. Do not force your ˹slave˺ girls into prostitution for your own worldly gains while they wish to remain chaste. And if someone coerces them, then after such a coercion Allah is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful ˹to them˺.",
    "Indeed, We have sent down to you clear revelations, along with examples of those who had gone before you, and a lesson to the God-fearing.",
    "Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His light is like a niche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star, lit from ˹the oil of˺ a blessed olive tree, ˹located˺ neither to the east nor the west, whose oil would almost glow, even without being touched by fire. Light upon light! Allah guides whoever He wills to His light. And Allah sets forth parables for humanity. For Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
    "˹That light shines˺ through houses ˹of worship˺ which Allah has ordered to be raised, and where His Name is mentioned. He is glorified there morning and evening",
    "by men who are not distracted—either by buying or selling—from Allah’s remembrance, or performing prayer, or paying alms-tax. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will tremble,",
    "˹hoping˺ that Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and increase them out of His grace. And Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit.",
    "As for the disbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, which the thirsty perceive as water, but when they approach it, they find it to be nothing. Instead, they find Allah there ˹in the Hereafter, ready˺ to settle their account. And Allah is swift in reckoning.",
    "Or ˹their deeds are˺ like the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves upon waves, topped by ˹dark˺ clouds. Darkness upon darkness! If one stretches out their hand, they can hardly see it. And whoever Allah does not bless with light will have no light!",
    "Do you not see that Allah is glorified by all those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds as they soar? Each ˹instinctively˺ knows their manner of prayer and glorification. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all they do.",
    "To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah is the final return.",
    "Do you not see that Allah gently drives the clouds, then joins them together, piling them up into masses, from which you see raindrops come forth? And He sends down from the sky mountains ˹of clouds˺ loaded with hail, pouring it on whoever He wills and averting it from whoever He wills. The flash of the clouds’ lightning nearly takes away eyesight.",
    "Allah alternates the day and night. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.",
    "And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
    "We have indeed sent down revelations clarifying ˹the truth˺. But Allah ˹only˺ guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.",
    "And the hypocrites say, “We believe in Allah and the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a group of them turns away soon after that. These are not ˹true˺ believers.",
    "And as soon as they are called to Allah and His Messenger so he may judge between them, a group of them turns away.",
    "But if the truth is in their favour, they come to him, fully submitting.",
    "Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or are they in doubt? Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust to them? In fact, it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.",
    "The only response of the ˹true˺ believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger so he may judge between them, is to say, “We hear and obey.” It is they who will ˹truly˺ succeed.",
    "For whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah and is mindful of Him, then it is they who will ˹truly˺ triumph.",
    "They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if you ˹O Prophet˺ were to command them, they would certainly march forth ˹in Allah’s cause˺. Say, “˹You˺ do not ˹have to˺ swear; your obedience is well known!” Surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.”",
    "Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for his duty and you are responsible for yours. And if you obey him, you will be ˹rightly˺ guided. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.”",
    "Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good that He will certainly make them successors in the land, as He did with those before them; and will surely establish for them their faith which He has chosen for them; and will indeed change their fear into security—˹provided that˺ they worship Me, associating nothing with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this ˹promise˺, it is they who will be the rebellious.",
    "Moreover, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy.",
    "Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that the disbelievers can escape in the land. The Fire will be their home. Indeed, what an evil destination!",
    "O believers! Let those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession and those of you who are still under age ask for your permission ˹to come in˺ at three times: before dawn prayer, when you take off your ˹outer˺ clothes at noon, and after the late evening prayer. ˹These are˺ three times of privacy for you. Other than these times, there is no blame on you or them to move freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "And when your children reach the age of puberty, let them seek permission ˹to come in˺, as their seniors do. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "As for elderly women past the age of marriage, there is no blame on them if they take off their ˹outer˺ garments, without revealing their adornments. But it is better for them if they avoid this ˹altogether˺. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "There is no restriction on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick. Nor on yourselves if you eat from your homes, or the homes of your fathers, or your mothers, or your brothers, or your sisters, or your paternal uncles, or your paternal aunts, or your maternal uncles, or your maternal aunts, or from the homes in your trust, or ˹the homes of˺ your friends. There is no blame on you eating together or separately. However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and good. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will understand.",
    "The ˹true˺ believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission ˹O Prophet˺ are the ones who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to whoever you wish and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "Do not treat the Messenger’s summons to you ˹as lightly˺ as your summons to one another. Allah certainly knows those of you who slip away, hiding behind others. So let those who disobey his orders beware, for an affliction may befall them, or a painful torment may overtake them.",
    "Surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He knows well what you stand for. And ˹on˺ the Day all will be returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. For Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
    "Blessed is the One Who sent down the Decisive Authority to His servant, so that he may be a warner to the whole world.",
    "˹Allah is˺ the One to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, Who has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor does He have a partner in ˹governing˺ the kingdom. He has created everything, ordaining it precisely.",
    "Yet they have taken besides Him gods who cannot create anything but are themselves created. Nor can they protect or benefit themselves. Nor can they control life, death, or resurrection.",
    "The disbelievers say, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but a fabrication which he made up with the help of others.” Their claim is totally unjustified and untrue!",
    "And they say, “˹These revelations are only˺ ancient fables which he has had written down, and they are rehearsed to him morning and evening.”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This ˹Quran˺ has been revealed by the One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth. Surely He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” ",
    "And they say ˹mockingly˺, “What kind of messenger is this who eats food and goes about in market-places ˹for a living˺? If only an angel had been sent down with him to be his co-warner,",
    "or a treasure had been cast down to him, or he had had a garden from which he may eat!” And the wrongdoers say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only following a bewitched man.”",
    "See ˹O Prophet˺ how they call you names! So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way.",
    "Blessed is the One Who—if He wills—can give you far better than ˹all˺ that: gardens under which rivers flow, and palaces as well.",
    "In fact, they deny the Hour. And for the deniers of the Hour, We have prepared a blazing Fire.",
    "Once it sees them from a distance, they will hear it fuming and growling.",
    "And when they are tossed into a narrow place inside ˹Hell˺, chained together, then and there they will cry out for ˹instant˺ destruction.",
    "˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry only once for destruction Today, but cry many times over!”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Is this better or the Garden of Eternity which the righteous have been promised, as a reward and ˹an ultimate˺ destination?",
    "There they will have whatever they wish for, forever. That is a promise ˹to be sought after˺, binding on your Lord.”",
    "˹Watch for˺ the Day He will gather them along with what they used to worship besides Allah, and ask ˹the objects of worship˺, “Was it you who misled these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the Way ˹on their own˺?”",
    "They will say, “Glory be to You! It was not right for ˹others like˺ us to take any lords besides You, but You allowed enjoyment for them and their forefathers ˹for so long˺ that they forgot ˹Your˺ remembrance and became a doomed people.”",
    "˹The doomed will be told˺, “Your gods have clearly denied your claims. So now you can neither ward off ˹the punishment˺ nor get any help.” And whoever of you does wrong, We will make them taste a horrible punishment.",
    "We never sent any messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺, who did not eat food and go about in market-places. We have made some of you a trial for others. Will you ˹not then˺ be patient? And your Lord is All-Seeing."
