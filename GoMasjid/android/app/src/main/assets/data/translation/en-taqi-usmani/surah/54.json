    "The Hour (of doom) has drawn near, and the moon has split asunder.",
    "When these people see a sign, they turn away and say, “(This is) a transient magic.”",
    "They have rejected (the Truth) and followed their desires, while every matter has to settle (at some time).",
    "And there has come to them as much news (of the earlier communities) as it is enough to deter,",
    "(containing) a perfect wisdom. But the warnings are of no avail (to them).",
    "Therefore, turn aside (O Prophet,) from them. (They will see the reality) on the day in which the caller will call (them) to a gruesome object.",
    "With their eyes humbled, they will come out of the graves like locusts spread all over,",
    "rushing quickly towards the caller. (On that Day) the disbelievers will say, “This is a hard day.”",
    "The people of NūH denied (the truth) before them. So they rejected Our servant, and said, “(He is) a madman”, and he was (also) threatened (by them).",
    "So he prayed to his Lord saying, “I am overpowered, so defend (me).”",
    "So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth profusely,",
    "and We caused the earth to gush forth as springs; so the water (of both kinds) met together for a destined event.",
    "And We caused him (NūH) to board that (ship) which had planks and nails,",
    "which sailed under Our Eyes, as a reward for the one who was rejected (by the infidels).",
    "And We left it (the ship) as a sign. So, is there one to take lesson?",
    "Then how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "(The people of) ‘Ād rejected (their prophet). So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "We did send to them a furious wind in a day of continuous misfortune,",
    "plucking people away, as if they were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.",
    "So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "(The people of) Thamūd rejected the warners.",
    "So they said, “Shall we follow a single human being from among us? Then we will be in error and insanity.",
    "Is it that the advice has been cast upon him alone out of all of us? No, but he is a bragging liar.”",
    "Tomorrow they will know who the bragging liar is!",
    "We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for them; so watch them (O SāliH,) and keep patience,",
    "and tell them that water (of the well) is to be shared between them (and the she-camel), so as the right of having water shall be attended by each (alternatively).",
    "Then they called their man (to kill the she-camel,) so he undertook (the task) and killed (the she-camel).",
    "So how was My torment and My warnings?",
    "We sent upon them a single Cry, and they were like crushed leafs of a hedge-builder.",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "The people of LūT rejected the warners.",
    "We sent upon them a rain of stones, except the family of LūT whom We saved in the last hours of night,",
    "as a grace from Us. This is how We reward the one who offers gratitude.",
    "And he (LūT) had certainly warned them of Our grasp, but they disputed the warnings.",
    "And they had even tried to tempt him against his guests (so that they may snatch them away for bad purpose,) but We blinded their eyes: “Now taste My torment and My warnings!”",
    "And on the next morning, a lasting torment overtook them:",
    "“Now taste My torment and My warnings.”",
    "Indeed We have made the Qur’ān easy for seeking advice. So, is there one to heed to the advice?",
    "And the warners came to the family of Fir‘aun (Pharaoh).",
    "(But) they rejected all Our signs; so We seized them- a seizure by One Mighty, Powerful.",
    "Are the disbelievers among you in a better position than all of the aforesaid (punished people), or do you have immunity (recorded) in the sacred books?",
    "Or do they say, “We are a large group, well-defended.”?",
    "Soon this ‘large group’ shall be defeated, and all of them will turn their backs.",
    "Rather the Hour (of judgment) is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour is more calamitous and much more bitter.",
    "Surely the guilty ones are in error and madness.",
    "On the Day when they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, (it will be said to them,) “Taste the touch of Hell.”",
    "Verily, We have created every thing according to (Our) predestination.",
    "And (implementation of) Our command is no more than a single act like the twinkling of an eye.",
    "We have destroyed people like you; so, is there one to take lesson?",
    "And every thing they have done is recorded in the books (of deeds).",
    "And every thing, small and big, is written down.",
    "Of course, the God-fearing will be in gardens and rivers,",
    "in a seat of Truth, near to the Omnipotent Sovereign."
