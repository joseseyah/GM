    "Woe to the curtailers",
    "who, when they measure something to receive from people, take it in full,",
    "and when they measure or weigh something to give it to them, give less than due.",
    "Do they not think that they have to be raised up",
    "on a Great Day,",
    "the Day when all the people will stand before the Lord of the worlds?",
    "Never! (i.e. they should never act in such a way.) Indeed the record of deeds of the sinners is in Sijjīn .",
    "And what may let you know what Sijjīn is?",
    "A register, inscribed!",
    "Woe that day to the deniers,",
    "who deny the Day of Requital!",
    "And none denies it but every sinful transgressor.",
    "When Our verses are recited to him, he says, “(These are) tales of the ancients.”",
    "No! But that which they used to commit has covered their hearts with rust.",
    "No! Indeed they will be screened off from their Lord on that Day.",
    "Then they will have to enter the Hell.",
    "Then it will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”",
    "No! The record of deeds of the righteous is in ‘Illiyyūn .",
    "And what may let you know what ‘Illiyyūn is ?",
    "A register inscribed,",
    "attended by those (angels) who are blessed with nearness to Allah!",
    "Indeed the righteous will be in absolute bliss.",
    "While (sitting) on thrones they will be watching (the scenes of Paradise).",
    "You will recognize the glamour of bliss on their faces.",
    "They will be served with a pure sealed wine to drink,",
    "the seal of which will be of musk.-It is this (bliss) in aspiring for which the competitors should race each other.",
    "-and it will be blended with (a drink from) Tasnīm ,",
    "a spring from which will drink those who are blessed with nearness.",
    "Indeed those who were guilty used to laugh at those who believed,",
    "and when they passed by them, they used to wink at one another,",
    "and when they went back to their family, they went enjoying their mockery,",
    "and when they saw them, they said, “Surely these are the ones who have gone astray”",
    "while they were not sent as watchmen over them.",
    "So, today those who believed will laugh at the disbelievers.",
    "While (sitting) on thrones, they will be seeing",
    "whether the disbelievers have been paid back for what they used to do."
