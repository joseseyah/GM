    "With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its husk, nor does a female conceive or deliver without His knowledge. And ˹consider˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are My ˹so-called˺ associate-gods?” They will cry, “We declare before you that none of us testifies to that ˹any longer˺.”",
    "Whatever ˹idols˺ they used to invoke besides Allah will fail them. And they will realize that they will have no escape.",
    "One never tires of praying for good. And if touched with evil, they become desperate and hopeless.",
    "And if We let them taste a mercy from Us after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what I deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.” But We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We will certainly make them taste a harsh torment.",
    "When We show favour to someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil, they make endless prayers ˹for good˺.",
    "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from Allah and you deny it: who can be more astray than those who have gone too far in opposition ˹to the truth˺?”",
    "We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that this ˹Quran˺ is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things?",
    "They are truly in doubt of the meeting with their Lord! ˹But˺ He is indeed Fully Aware of everything.",
    "Ḥâ-Mĩm.",
    "’Aĩn-Sĩn-Qãf.",
    "And so you ˹O Prophet˺ are sent revelation, just like those before you, by Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And He is the Most High, the Greatest.",
    "The heavens nearly burst, one above the other, ˹in awe of Him˺. And the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and seek forgiveness for those on earth. Surely Allah alone is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "As for those who take other protectors besides Him, Allah is Watchful over them. And you ˹O Prophet˺ are not a keeper over them.",
    "And so We have revealed to you a Quran in Arabic, so you may warn the Mother of Cities and everyone around it, and warn of the Day of Gathering—about which there is no doubt—˹when˺ a group will be in Paradise and another in the Blaze.",
    "Had Allah willed, He could have easily made all ˹humanity˺ into a single community ˹of believers˺. But He admits into His mercy whoever He wills. And the wrongdoers will have no protector or helper.",
    "How can they take protectors besides Him? Allah alone is the Protector. He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead. And He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything.",
    "˹Say to the believers, O  Prophet,˺ “Whatever you may differ about, its judgment rests with Allah. That is Allah—my Lord. In Him I put my trust, and to Him I ˹always˺ turn.”",
    "˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you spouses from among yourselves, and ˹made˺ mates for cattle ˹as well˺—multiplying you ˹both˺. There is nothing like Him, for He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
    "To Him belong the keys ˹of the treasuries˺ of the heavens and the earth. He gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. Indeed, He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
    "He has ordained for you ˹believers˺ the Way which He decreed for Noah, and what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what We decreed for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, ˹commanding:˺ “Uphold the faith, and make no divisions in it.” What you call the polytheists to is unbearable for them. Allah chooses for Himself whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns ˹to Him˺.",
    "They did not split ˹into sects˺ out of mutual envy until knowledge came to them. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are truly in alarming doubt about this ˹Quran˺.",
    "Because of that, you ˹O Prophet˺ will invite ˹all˺. Be steadfast as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires. And say, “I believe in every Scripture Allah has revealed. And I am commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We will be accountable for our deeds and you for yours. There is no ˹need for˺ contention between us. Allah will gather us together ˹for judgment˺. And to Him is the final return.”",
    "As for those who dispute about Allah after He is ˹already˺ acknowledged ˹by many˺, their argument is futile in the sight of their Lord. Upon them is wrath, and they will suffer a severe punishment.",
    "It is Allah Who has revealed the Book with the truth and the balance ˹of justice˺. You never know, perhaps the Hour is near.",
    "Those who disbelieve in it ˹ask to˺ hasten it ˹mockingly˺. But the believers are fearful of it, knowing that it is the truth. Surely those who dispute about the Hour have gone far astray.",
    "Allah is Ever Kind to His servants. He provides ˹abundantly˺ to whoever He wills. And He is the All-Powerful, Almighty.",
    "Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase their harvest. And whoever desires ˹only˺ the harvest of this world, We will give them some of it, but they will have no share in the Hereafter.",
    "Or do they have associate-gods who have ordained for them some ˹polytheistic˺ beliefs, which Allah has not authorized? Had it not been for ˹prior˺ decree on Judgment, the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.",
    "You will see the wrongdoers fearful ˹of the punishment˺ for what they committed but it will be inevitable for them, whereas those who believe and do good will be in the lush Gardens of Paradise. They will have whatever they desire from their Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the greatest bounty.",
    "That ˹reward˺ is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for a reward for this ˹message˺—only honour for ˹our˺ kinship.” Whoever earns a good deed, We will increase it in goodness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.",
    "Or do they say, “He has fabricated a lie about Allah!”? ˹If you had,˺ Allah would have sealed your heart, if He willed. And Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
    "He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons ˹their˺ sins. And He knows whatever you do.",
    "He responds to those who believe and do good, and increases their reward out of His grace. As for the disbelievers, they will suffer a severe punishment.",
    "Had Allah given abundant provisions to ˹all˺ His servants, they would have certainly transgressed throughout the land. But He sends down whatever He wills in perfect measure. He is truly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.",
    "He is the One Who sends down rain after people have given up hope, spreading out His mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy.",
    "And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills.",
    "Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much.",
    "You can never escape ˹Him˺ on earth, nor do you have any protector or helper besides Allah.",
    "And among His signs are the ships like mountains ˹sailing˺ in the sea.",
    "If He wills, He can calm the wind, leaving the ships motionless on the water. Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful.",
    "Or He can wreck the ships for what the people have committed—though He forgives much—",
    "so those who dispute about Our signs may know that they have no refuge.",
    "Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is ˹no more than a fleeting˺ enjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;",
    "who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and forgive when angered;",
    "who respond to their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and donate from what We have provided for them;",
    "and who enforce justice when wronged.",
    "The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with Allah. He certainly does not like the wrongdoers.",
    "There is no blame on those who enforce justice after being wronged.",
    "Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment.",
    "And whoever endures patiently and forgives—surely this is a resolve to aspire to.",
    "And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back ˹to the world˺?”",
    "And you will see them exposed to the Fire, fully humbled out of disgrace, stealing glances ˹at it˺. And the believers will say, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on Judgment Day.” The wrongdoers will certainly be in everlasting torment.",
    "They will have no protectors to help them against Allah. And whoever Allah leaves to stray, for them there is no way.",
    "Respond to your Lord before the coming of a Day from Allah that cannot be averted. There will be no refuge for you then, nor ˹grounds for˺ denial ˹of sins˺.",
    "But if they turn away, We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over them. Your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. And indeed, when We let someone taste a mercy from Us, they become prideful ˹because˺ of it. But when afflicted with evil because of what their hands have done, then one becomes totally ungrateful. ",
    "To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wills. He blesses whoever He wills with daughters, and blesses whoever He wills with sons,",
    "or grants both, sons and daughters, ˹to whoever He wills˺, and leaves whoever He wills infertile. He is indeed All-Knowing, Most Capable.",
    "It is not ˹possible˺ for a human being to have Allah communicate with them, except through inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger-angel to reveal whatever He wills by His permission. He is surely Most High, All-Wise.",
    "And so We have sent to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation by Our command. You did not know of ˹this˺ Book and faith ˹before˺. But We have made it a light, by which We guide whoever We will of Our servants. And you are truly leading ˹all˺ to the Straight Path—",
    "the Path of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Surely to Allah all matters will return ˹for judgment˺.",
    "Ḥâ-Mĩm.",
    "By the clear Book!",
    "Certainly, We have made it a Quran in Arabic so perhaps you will understand.",
    "And indeed, it is—in the Master Record with Us—highly esteemed, rich in wisdom.",
    "Should We then turn the ˹Quranic˺ Reminder away from you ˹simply˺ because you have been a transgressing people?",
    "˹Imagine˺ how many prophets We sent to those ˹destroyed˺ before!",
    "But no prophet ever came to them without being mocked.",
    "So We destroyed those who were far mightier than these ˹Meccans˺. The examples of ˹their˺ predecessors have ˹already˺ been related. ",
    "If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “The Almighty, All-Knowing did.”",
    "˹He is the One˺ Who has laid out the earth for you, and set in it pathways for you so that you may find your way.",
    "And ˹He is the One˺ Who sends down rain from the sky in perfect measure, with which We give life to a lifeless land. And so will you be brought forth ˹from the grave˺.",
    "And ˹He is the One˺ Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs, and made for you ships and animals to ride",
    "so that you may sit firmly on their backs, and remember your Lord’s blessings once you are settled on them, saying, “Glory be to the One Who has subjected these for us, for we could have never done so ˹on our own˺.",
    "And surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.”",
    "Still the pagans have made some of His creation out to be a part of Him. Indeed, humankind is clearly ungrateful.",
    "Has He taken ˹angels as His˺ daughters from what He created, and favoured you ˹O pagans˺ with sons?",
    "Whenever one of them is given the good news of what they attribute to the Most Compassionate, his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage.",
    "˹Do they attribute to Him˺ those who are brought up in fineries and are not commanding in disputes?",
    "Still they have labelled the angels, who are servants of the Most Compassionate, as female. Did they witness their creation? Their statement will be recorded, and they will be questioned!",
    "And they argue, “Had the Most Compassionate willed, we would have never worshipped them.” They have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They do nothing but lie.",
    "Or have We given them a Book ˹for proof˺, before this ˹Quran˺, to which they are holding firm?",
    "In fact, they say, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are following in their footsteps.”",
    "Similarly, whenever We sent a warner to a society before you ˹O Prophet˺, its ˹spoiled˺ elite would say, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are walking in their footsteps.”",
    "Each ˹warner˺ asked, “Even if what I brought you is better guidance than what you found your forefathers practicing?” They replied, “We totally reject whatever you have been sent with.”",
    "So We inflicted punishment upon them. See then what was the fate of the deniers!",
    "˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when Abraham declared to his father and his people, “I am totally free of whatever ˹gods˺ you worship,",
    "except the One Who originated me, and He will surely guide me.”",
    "And he left this enduring declaration among his descendants, so they may ˹always˺ turn back ˹to Allah˺. ",
    "In fact, I had allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their forefathers, until the truth came to them along with a messenger making things clear.",
    "˹But˺ when the truth came to them, they said, “This is magic, and we totally reject it.”",
    "And they exclaimed, “If only this Quran was revealed to a great man from ˹one of˺ the two cities!”",
    "Is it they who distribute your Lord’s mercy? We ˹alone˺ have distributed their ˹very˺ livelihood among them in this worldly life and raised some of them in rank above others so that some may employ others in service. ˹But˺ your Lord’s mercy is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.",
    "Were it not that people might ˹be tempted to˺ become one community ˹of disbelievers˺, We would have supplied the homes of ˹only˺ those who disbelieve in the Most Compassionate with silver roofs and ˹silver˺ stairways to ascend,",
    "as well as ˹silver˺ gates and thrones to recline on,",
    "and ornaments ˹of gold˺. Yet all this is no more than a ˹fleeting˺ enjoyment in this worldly life. ˹But˺ the Hereafter with your Lord is ˹only˺ for those mindful ˹of Him˺.",
    "And whoever turns a blind eye to the Reminder of the Most Compassionate, We place at the disposal of each a devilish one as their close associate,",
    "who will certainly hinder them from the ˹Right˺ Way while they think they are ˹rightly˺ guided.",
    "But when such a person comes to Us, one will say ˹to their associate˺, “I wish you were as distant from me as the east is from the west! What an evil associate ˹you were˺!”",
    "˹It will be said to both,˺ “Since you all did wrong, sharing in the punishment will be of no benefit to you this Day.” ",
    "Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or those clearly astray?",
    "Even if We take you away ˹from this world˺, We will surely inflict punishment upon them.",
    "Or if We show you what We threaten them with, We certainly have full power over them.",
    "So hold firmly to what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺. You are truly on the Straight Path.",
    "Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a glory for you and your people. And you will ˹all˺ be questioned ˹about it˺.",
    "Ask ˹the followers of˺ the messengers that We already sent before you if We ˹ever˺ appointed ˹other˺ gods to be worshipped besides the Most Compassionate.",
    "Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, and he said: “I am a messenger of the Lord of all worlds.”",
    "But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them,",
    "although every sign We showed them was greater than the one before. Ultimately, We seized them with torments so that they might return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
    "˹Then˺ they pleaded, “O ˹mighty˺ magician! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. We will certainly accept guidance.”",
    "But as soon as We removed the torments from them, they broke their promise.",
    "And Pharaoh called out to his people, boasting, “O my people! Am I not sovereign over Egypt as well as ˹all˺ these streams flowing at my feet? Can you not see?",
    "Am I not better than this nobody who can hardly express himself?",
    "Why then have no golden bracelets ˹of kingship˺ been granted to him or angels come with him as escorts!”",
    "And so he fooled his people, and they obeyed him. They were truly a rebellious people.",
    "So when they enraged Us, We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them all.",
    "And We made them an example and a lesson for those after them.",
    "When the son of Mary was cited as an example ˹in argument˺, your people ˹O Prophet˺ broke into ˹joyful˺ applause.",
    "They exclaimed, “Which is better: our gods or Jesus?” They cite him only to argue. In fact, they are a people prone to dispute.",
    "He was only a servant We showed favour to, and made as an example for the Children of Israel.",
    "Had We willed, We could have easily replaced you ˹all˺ with angels, succeeding one another on earth.",
    "And his ˹second˺ coming is truly a sign for the Hour. So have no doubt about it, and follow me. This is the Straight Path.",
    "And do not let Satan hinder you, ˹for˺ he is certainly your sworn enemy.",
    "When Jesus came with clear proofs, he declared, “I have come to you with wisdom, and to clarify to you some of what you differ about. So fear Allah, and obey me.",
    "Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺. This is the Straight Path.”",
    "Yet their ˹various˺ groups have differed among themselves ˹about him˺, so woe to the wrongdoers when they face the torment of a painful Day!",
    "Are they waiting for the Hour to take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺?",
    "Close friends will be enemies to one another on that Day, except the righteous,",
    "˹who will be told,˺ “O My servants! There is no fear for you Today, nor will you grieve—",
    "˹those˺ who believed in Our signs and ˹fully˺ submitted ˹to Us˺.",
    "Enter Paradise, you and your spouses, rejoicing.”",
    "Golden trays and cups will be passed around to them. There will be whatever the souls desire and the eyes delight in. And you will be there forever.",
    "That is the Paradise which you will be awarded for what you used to do.",
    "There you will have abundant fruit to eat from.",
    "Indeed, the wicked will be in the torment of Hell forever.",
    "It will never be lightened for them, and there they will be overwhelmed with despair.",
    "We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers.",
    "They will cry, “O Mâlik! Let your Lord finish us off.” He will answer, “You are definitely here to stay.”",
    "We certainly brought the truth to you, but most of you were resentful of the truth.",
    "Or have they mastered some ˹evil˺ plan? Then We ˹too˺ are surely planning.",
    "Or do they think that We do not hear their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks? Yes ˹We do˺! And Our messenger-angels are in their presence, recording ˹it all˺.",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the Most Compassionate ˹really˺ had offspring, I would be the first worshipper.”",
    "Glorified is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, far above what they claim.",
    "So let them indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until they face their Day, which they have been warned of.",
    "It is He Who is ˹the only˺ God in the heavens and ˹the only˺ God on the earth. For He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
    "And Blessed is the One to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between! With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
    "˹But˺ those ˹objects of worship˺ they invoke besides Him have no power to intercede, except those who testify to the truth knowingly.",
    "If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created them, they will certainly say, “Allah!” How can they then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?",
    "˹Allah is Aware of˺ the Prophet’s cry: “O my Lord! Indeed, these are a people who persist in disbelief.”",
    "So bear with them and respond with peace. They will soon come to know.",
    "Ḥâ-Mĩm.",
    "By the clear Book!",
    "Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed night, for We always warn ˹against evil˺.",
    "On that night every matter of wisdom is ordained",
    "by a command from Us, for We have always sent ˹messengers˺",
    "as a mercy from your Lord. He ˹alone˺ is truly the All-Hearing, All-Knowing—",
    "the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.",
    "There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He ˹alone˺ gives life and causes death. ˹He is˺ your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers.",
    "In fact, they are in doubt, amusing themselves.",
    "Wait then ˹O Prophet˺ for the day ˹when˺ the sky will be veiled in haze, clearly visible,",
    "overwhelming the people. ˹They will cry,˺ “This is a painful torment.",
    "Our Lord! Remove ˹this˺ torment from us, ˹and˺ we will certainly believe.”",
    "How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to them, making things clear,",
    "then they turned away from him, saying, “A madman, taught by others!”?",
    "Indeed, We will remove ˹that˺ torment for a while, and you ˹Meccans˺ will return ˹to disbelief˺.",
    "˹Then˺ on the Day We will deal ˹you˺ the fiercest blow, We will surely inflict punishment.",
    "Indeed, before them We tested Pharaoh’s people: a noble messenger came to them,",
    "˹proclaiming,˺ “Hand over the servants of Allah to me. I am truly a trustworthy messenger to you.",
    "And do not be arrogant with Allah. I have certainly come to you with a compelling proof.",
    "And indeed, I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord so you do not stone me ˹to death˺.",
    "˹But˺ if you do not believe me, then let me be.”",
    "Ultimately, he cried out to his Lord, “These are a wicked people!”",
    "˹Allah responded,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued.",
    "And leave the sea parted, for they are certainly an army bound to drown.”",
    "˹Imagine˺ how many gardens and springs the tyrants left behind,",
    "as well as ˹various˺ crops and splendid residences,",
    "and luxuries which they fully enjoyed.",
    "So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to another people.",
    "Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor was their fate delayed.",
    "And We certainly delivered the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment",
    "of Pharaoh. He was truly a tyrant, a transgressor.",
    "And indeed, We chose the Israelites knowingly above the others.",
    "And We showed them signs in which there was a clear test.",
    "Indeed, these ˹Meccans˺ say,",
    "“There is nothing beyond our first death, and we will never be resurrected.",
    "Bring ˹back˺ our forefathers, if what you say is true.”",
    "Are they superior to the people of Tubba’ and those before them? We destroyed them ˹all˺, ˹for˺ they were truly wicked.",
    "We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport.",
    "We only created them for a purpose, but most of these ˹pagans˺ do not know.",
    "Surely the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is the time appointed for all—",
    "the Day no kith or kin will be of benefit to another whatsoever, nor will they be helped,",
    "except those shown mercy by Allah. He is truly the Almighty, Most Merciful.",
    "Surely ˹the fruit of˺ the tree of Zaqqûm",
    "will be the food of the evildoer.",
    "Like molten metal, it will boil in the bellies",
    "like the boiling of hot water.",
    "˹It will be said,˺ “Seize them and drag them into the depths of the Hellfire.",
    "Then pour over their heads the torment of boiling water.”",
    "˹The wicked will be told,˺ “Taste this. You mighty, noble one!",
    "This is truly what you ˹all˺ used to doubt.”",
    "Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place,",
    "amid Gardens and springs,",
    "dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another.",
    "So it will be. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.",
    "There they will call for every fruit in serenity.",
    "There they will never taste death, beyond the first death. And He will protect them from the punishment of the Hellfire—",
    "as ˹an act of˺ grace from your Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.",
    "Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O Prophet˺ so perhaps they will be mindful.",
    "Wait then! They too are certainly waiting.",
    "Ḥâ-Mĩm.",
    "The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.",
    "Surely in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers.",
    "And in your own creation, and whatever living beings He dispersed, are signs for people of sure faith.",
    "And ˹in˺ the alternation of the day and the night, the provision sent down from the skies by Allah—reviving the earth after its death—and the shifting of the winds, are signs for people of understanding.",
    "These are Allah’s revelations which We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. So what message will they believe in after ˹denying˺ Allah and His revelations?",
    "Woe to every sinful liar.",
    "They hear Allah’s revelations recited to them, then persist ˹in denial˺ arrogantly as if they did not hear them. So give them good news of a painful punishment.",
    "And whenever they learn anything of Our revelations, they make a mockery of it. It is they who will suffer a humiliating punishment.",
    "Awaiting them is Hell. Their ˹worldly˺ gains will not be of any benefit to them whatsoever, nor will those protectors they have taken besides Allah. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment.",
    "This ˹Quran˺ is ˹true˺ guidance. And those who deny their Lord’s revelations will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain.",
    "Allah is the One Who has subjected the sea for you so that ships may sail upon it by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and that perhaps you will be grateful.",
    "He ˹also˺ subjected for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth—all by His grace. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.",
    "˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear Allah’s days ˹of torment˺, so that He will reward each group for what they used to commit.",
    "Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Then to your Lord you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
    "Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood; granted them good, lawful provisions; and favoured them above the others.",
    "We ˹also˺ gave them clear commandments regarding ˹their˺ faith. But it was not until knowledge came to them that they differed out of mutual envy. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences.",
    "Now We have set you ˹O Prophet˺ on the ˹clear˺ Way of faith. So follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who do not know ˹the truth˺.",
    "They certainly can be of no benefit to you against Allah whatsoever. Surely the wrongdoers are patrons of each other, whereas Allah is the Patron of the righteous.",
    "This ˹Quran˺ is an insight for humanity—a guide and mercy for people of sure faith.",
    "Or do those who commit evil deeds ˹simply˺ think that We will make them equal—in their life and after their death—to those who believe and do good? How wrong is their judgment!",
    "For Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose, so that every soul may be paid back for what it has committed. And none will be wronged.",
    "Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ those who have taken their own desires as their god? ˹And so˺ Allah left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after Allah? Will you ˹all˺ not then be mindful?",
    "And they argue, “There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die; others are born. And nothing destroys us but ˹the passage of˺ time.” Yet they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They only speculate.",
    "And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if what you say is true!”",
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ gives you life, then causes you to die, then will gather you ˹all˺ on the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know.”",
    "To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. On the Day the Hour will be established, the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss.",
    "And you will see every faith-community on its knees. Every community will be summoned to its record ˹of deeds˺. ˹They all will be told,˺ “This Day you will be rewarded for what you used to do.",
    "This record of Ours speaks the truth about you. Indeed, We always had your deeds recorded ˹by the angels˺.”",
    "As for those who believed and did good, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the absolute triumph.",
    "And as for those who disbelieved, ˹they will be told,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, yet you acted arrogantly and were a wicked people?",
    "And whenever it was said ˹to you˺, ‘Surely Allah’s promise ˹of judgment˺ is true and there is no doubt about the Hour,’ you said ˹mockingly˺, ‘We do not know what the Hour is! We think it is no more than speculation, and we are not convinced ˹that it will ever come˺.’”",
    "And the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.",
    "It will be said, “This Day We will neglect you as you neglected the meeting of this Day of yours! Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.",
    "This is because you made a mockery of Allah’s revelations, and were deluded by ˹your˺ worldly life.” So ˹from˺ that Day ˹on˺ they will not be taken out of the Fire, nor will they be allowed to appease ˹their Lord˺.",
    "So all praise is for Allah—Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all worlds.",
    "To Him belongs ˹all˺ Majesty in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise."
