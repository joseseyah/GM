    "Verily, We have sent it (this Qur’ân) down in the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).",
    "And what will make you know what the night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is?",
    "The night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allâh in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e.  years and  months).",
    "Therein descend the angels and the Rûh [Jibrîl (Gabrîl)] by Allâh’s Permission with all Decrees,",
    "(All that night), there is Peace (and Goodness from Allâh to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn."
