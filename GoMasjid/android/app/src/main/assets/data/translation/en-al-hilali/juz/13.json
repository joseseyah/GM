    "\"And I free not myself (from the blame). Verily, the (human) self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His Mercy (upon whom He wills). Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"",
    "And the king said: \"Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person.\" Then, when he spoke to him, he said: \"Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted.\"",
    "[Yûsuf (Joseph)] said: \"Set me over the store-houses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge\" (as a minister of finance in Egypt).",
    "Thus did We give full authority to Yûsuf (Joseph) in the land, to take possession therein, when or where he likes. We bestow of Our Mercy on whom We will, and We make not to be lost the reward of Al-Muhsinûn (the good doers - See V.:).",
    "And verily, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and used to fear Allâh and keep their duty to Him (by abstaining from all kinds of sins and evil deeds and by performing all kinds of righteous good deeds).",
    "And Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brethren came and they entered unto him, and he recognized them, but they recognized him not.",
    "And when he had furnished them with their provisions (according to their need), he said: \"Bring me a brother of yours from your father (he meant Benjamin). See you not that I give full measure, and that I am the best of the hosts?",
    "\"But if you bring him not to me, there shall be no measure (of corn) for you with me, nor shall you come near me.\"",
    "They said: \"We shall try to get permission (for him) from his father, and verily, we shall do it.\"",
    "And [Yûsuf (Joseph)] told his servants to put their money (with which they had bought the corn) into their bags, so that they might know it when they go back to their people; in order they might come again.",
    "So, when they returned to their father, they said: \"O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother). So send our brother with us, and we shall get our measure and truly we will guard him.\"",
    "He said: \"Can I entrust him to you except as I entrusted his brother [Yûsuf (Joseph)] to you aforetime? But Allâh is the Best to guard, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.\"",
    "And when they opened their bags, they found their money had been returned to them. They said: \"O our father! What (more) can we desire? This, our money has been returned to us; so we shall get (more) food for our family, and we shall guard our brother and add one more measure of a camel’s load. This quantity is easy (for the king to give).\"",
    "He [Ya‘qûb (Jacob)] said: \"I will not send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me in Allâh’s Name, that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded (by enemies),\" And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: \"Allâh is the Witness to what we have said.\"",
    "And he said: \"O my sons! Do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates, and I cannot avail you against Allâh at all. Verily! The decision rests only with Allâh. In Him, I put my trust and let all those that trust, put their trust in Him.\"",
    "And when they entered according to their father’s advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the Will of) Allâh; it was but a need of Ya‘qûb’s (Jacob) inner-self which he discharged. And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not.",
    "And when they went in before Yûsuf (Joseph), he took his brother (Benjamin) to himself and said: \"Verily! I am your brother, so grieve not for what they used to do.\"",
    "So when he had furnished them forth with their provisions, he put the (golden) bowl in his brother’s bag. Then a crier cried: \"O you (in) the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!\"",
    "They, turning towards them, said: \"What is it that you have lost?\"",
    "They said: \"We have lost the (golden) bowl of the king and for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; and I will be bound by it.\"",
    "They said: \"By Allâh! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!\"",
    "They [Yûsuf’s (Joseph) men] said: \"What then shall be the penalty of him, if you are (proved to be) liars.\"",
    "They [Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brothers] said: \"His penalty should be that he, in whose bag it is found, should be held for the punishment (of the crime). Thus we punish the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)!\"",
    "So he [Yûsuf (Joseph)] began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. Thus did We plan for Yûsuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), except that Allâh willed it. (So Allâh made the brothers to bind themselves with their way of \"punishment, i.e. enslaving of a thief.\") We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allâh).",
    "They [(Yûsuf’s (Joseph) brothers] said: \"If he steals, there was a brother of his [Yûsuf (Joseph)] who did steal before (him).\" But these things did Yûsuf (Joseph) keep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He said (within himself): \"You are in worst case, and Allâh is the Best Knower of that which you describe!\"",
    "They said: \"O ruler of the land! Verily, he has an old father (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place. Indeed we think that you are one of the Muhsinûn (good-doers - see the footnote of V.:).\"",
    "He said: \"Allâh forbid, that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property. Indeed (if we did so), we should be Zâlimûn (wrong-doers).\"",
    "So, when they despaired of him, they held a conference in private. The eldest among them said: \"Know you not that your father did take an oath from you in Allâh’s Name, and before this you did fail in your duty with Yûsuf (Joseph)? Therefore I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allâh decides my case (by releasing Benjamin) and He is the Best of the judges.",
    "\"Return to your father and say, ‘O our father! Verily, your son (Benjamin) has stolen, and we testify not except according to what we know, and we could not know the Unseen!",
    "\"And ask (the people of) the town where we have been, and the caravan in which we returned; and indeed we are telling the truth.\"",
    "He [Ya‘qûb (Jacob)] said: \"Nay, but your ownselves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me). May be Allâh will bring them (back) all to me. Truly He! Only He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\"",
    "And he turned away from them and said: \"Alas, my grief for Yûsuf (Joseph)!\" And he lost his sight because of the sorrow that he was suppressing.",
    "They said: \"By Allâh! You will never cease remembering Yûsuf (Joseph) until you become weak with old age, or until you be of the dead.\"",
    "He said: \"I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allâh, and I know from Allâh that which you know not.",
    "\"O my sons! Go you and enquire about Yûsuf (Joseph) and his brother, and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allâh’s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve.\"",
    "Then, when they entered unto him [Yûsuf (Joseph)], they said: \"O ruler of the land! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have brought but poor capital, so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allâh does reward the charitable.\"",
    "He said: \"Do you know what you did with Yûsuf (Joseph) and his brother, when you were ignorant?\"",
    "They said: \"Are you indeed Yûsuf (Joseph)?\" He said: \"I am Yûsuf (Joseph), and this is my brother (Benjamin). Allâh has indeed been gracious to us. Verily, he who fears Allâh with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allâh makes not the reward of the Muhsinûn (good-doers - see V.:) to be lost.\"",
    "They said: \"By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been sinners.\"",
    "He said: \"No reproach on you this day; may Allâh forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!",
    "\"Go with this shirt of mine, and cast it over the face of my father, he will become clear-sighted, and bring me all your family.\"",
    "And when the caravan departed, their father said: \"I do indeed feel the smell of Yûsuf (Joseph), if only you think me not a dotard (a person who has weakness of mind because of old age).\"",
    "They said: \"By Allâh! Certainly, you are in your old error.\"",
    "Then, when the bearer of the glad tidings arrived, he cast it (the shirt) over his face, and he became clear-sighted. He said: \"Did I not say to you, ‘I know from Allâh that which you know not.’\"",
    "They said: \"O our father! Ask Forgiveness (from Allâh) for our sins, indeed we have been sinners.\"",
    "He said: \"I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you, verily He! Only He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\"",
    "Then, when they came in before Yûsuf (Joseph), he took his parents to himself and said: \"Enter Egypt, if Allâh wills, in security.\"",
    "And he raised his parents to the throne and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: \"O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true! He was indeed good to me, when He took me out of the prison, and brought you (all here) out of the bedouin-life, after Shaitân (Satan) had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Certainly, my Lord is the Most Courteous and Kind unto whom He wills. Truly He! Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.",
    "\"My Lord! You have indeed bestowed on me of the sovereignty, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams - the (Only) Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Walî (Protector, Helper, Supporter, Guardian, God, Lord.) in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim (the one submitting to Your Will), and join me with the righteous.\"",
    "That is of the news of the Ghaib (Unseen) which We reveal to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم). You were not (present) with them when they arranged their plan together, and (while) they were plotting.",
    "And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.",
    "And no reward you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) ask of them (those who deny your Prophethood) for it; it (the Qur’ân) is no less than a Reminder and an advice unto the ‘Âlamîn (men and jinn).",
    "And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by, while they are averse therefrom.",
    "And most of them believe not in Allâh except that they attribute partners unto Him [i.e. they are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse : ].",
    "Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of the Torment of Allâh, or of the coming against them of the (Final) Hour, all of a sudden while they perceive not?",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): \"This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allâh i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allâh (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh; those who worship others along with Allâh or set up rivals or partners to Allâh).\"",
    "And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of the townships. Have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those who were before them? And verily, the home of the Hereafter is the best for those who fear Allâh and obey Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds). Do you not then understand?",
    "(They were reprieved) until, when the Messengers gave up hope and thought that they were denied (by their people), then came to them Our Help, and whomsoever We willed were rescued. And Our punishment cannot be warded off from the people who are Mujrimûn (criminals, sinners, disbelievers, polytheists).",
    "Indeed in their stories, there is a lesson for men of understanding. It (the Qur’ân) is not a forged statement but a confirmation of (Allâh’s existing Books) which were before it [i.e. the Taurât (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel) and other Scriptures of Allâh] and a detailed explanation of everything and a guide and a Mercy for the people who believe.",
    "Alif-Lâm-Mîm-Râ.\r\n[These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’an; and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings].These are the Verses of the Book (the Qur’an), and that which has been revealed unto you (Muhammad ﷺ) from your Lord is the truth, out most men believe not.",
    "Allâh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose above (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round), each running (its course) for a term appointed. He manages and regulates all affairs; He explains the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.",
    "And it is He Who spread out the earth, and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and of every kind of fruits He made Zawjain Ithnaîn (two in pairs - may mean two kinds or it may mean: of two varieties, e.g. black and white, sweet and sour, small and big). He brings the night as a cover over the day. Verily, in these things, there are Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs, etc.) for people who reflect.",
    "And in the earth are neighbouring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops (fields), and date-palms, growing into two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise (one stem root for every palm), watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Verily, in these things there are Ayât (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs) for the people who understand.",
    "And if you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) wonder (at these polytheists who deny your message of Islâmic Monotheism and have taken besides Allâh others for worship who can neither harm nor benefit), then wondrous is their saying: \"When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation?\" They are those who disbelieved in their Lord! They are those who will have iron chains tying their hands to their necks. They will be the dwellers of the Fire to abide therein.",
    "They ask you to hasten the evil before the good, while (many) exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But verily, your Lord is full of Forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrong-doing. And verily, your Lord is (also) Severe in punishment.",
    "And the disbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?\" You are only a warner, and to every people there is a guide.",
    "Allâh knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.",
    "All-Knower of the Unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High.",
    "It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.",
    "For him (each person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allâh. Verily! Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh). But when Allâh wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.",
    "It is He Who shows you the lightning, as a fear (for travellers) and as a hope (for those who wait for rain). And it is He Who brings up (or originates) the clouds, heavy (with water).",
    "And Ar-Ra‘d (thunder) glorifies and praises Him, and so do the angels because of His Awe. He sends the thunderbolts, and therewith He strikes whom He wills, yet they (disbelievers) dispute about Allâh. And He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment.",
    "For Him (Allah, Alone) is the Word of Truth (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). And those whom they (polytheists and disbelievers) invoke, answer them no more than one who stretches forth his hand (at the edge of a deep well) for water to reach his mouth, but it reaches him not; and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but an error (i.e. of no use).",
    "And unto Allâh (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons.",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"(It is) Allâh.\" Say: \"Have you then taken (for worship) Auliyâ’ (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?\" Say: \"Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allâh partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them?\" Say: \"Allâh is the Creator of all things; and He is the One, the Irresistible.\"",
    "He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure, but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface - and (also) from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, rises a foam like unto it, thus does Allâh (by parables) show forth truth and falsehood. Then, as for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allâh sets forth parables (for the truth and falsehood, i.e. Belief and disbelief).",
    "For those who answered their Lord’s Call [believed in the Oneness of Allâh and followed His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم i.e. Islâmic Monotheism] is Al-Husnâ (i.e. Paradise). But those who answered not His Call (disbelieved in the Oneness of Allâh and followed not His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), if they had all that is in the earth together with its like, they would offer it in order to save themselves (from the torment, but it will be in vain). For them there will be the terrible reckoning. Their dwelling-place will be Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.",
    "Shall he then who knows that what has been revealed unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) from your Lord is the truth be like him who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.",
    "Those who fulfil the Covenant of Allâh and break not the Mîthâq (bond, treaty, covenant).",
    "And those who join that which Allâh has commanded to be joined (i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship), and fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning (i.e. abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allâh has forbidden and perform all kinds of good deeds which Allâh has ordained).",
    "And those who remain patient, seeking their Lord’s Countenance, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and spend out of that which We have bestowed on them, secretly and openly, and defend evil with good, for such there is a good end.",
    "‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which they shall enter and (also) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying):",
    "\"Salâmun ‘Alaikum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!\"",
    "And those who break the Covenant of Allâh, after its ratification, and sever that which Allâh has commanded to be joined (i.e. they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allâh’s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).",
    "Allâh increases the provision for whom He wills, and straitens (it for whom He wills), and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter is but a brief passing enjoyment.",
    "And those who disbelieved say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) from his Lord?\" Say: \"Verily, Allâh sends astray whom He wills and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance.\"",
    "Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allâh: verily, in the remembrance of Allâh do hearts find rest.",
    "Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism), and work righteousness, Tûbâ (all kinds of happiness or name of a tree in Paradise) is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return.",
    "Thus have We sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to a community before whom other communities have passed away, in order that you might recite unto them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious (Allâh) Say: \"He is my Lord! Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)! In Him is my trust, and to Him will be my return with repentance.\"",
    "And if there had been a Qur’ân with which mountains could be moved (from their places), or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak (it would not have been other than this Qur’ân). But the decision of all things is certainly with Allâh. Have not then those who believed yet known that had Allâh willed, He could have guided all mankind? And a disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) settles close to their homes, until the Promise of Allâh comes to pass. Certainly, Allâh breaks not His Promise.",
    "And indeed (many) Messengers were mocked at before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), but I granted respite to those who disbelieved, and finally I punished them. Then how (terrible) was My punishment!",
    "Is then He (Allâh) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)? Yet, they ascribe partners to Allâh. Say: \"Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words.\" Nay! To those who disbelieved, their plotting is made fairseeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Path; and whom Allâh sends astray, for him there is no guide.",
    "For them is a torment in the life of this world, and certainly, harder is the torment of the Hereafter. And they have no Wâq (defender or protector) against Allâh.",
    "The description of the Paradise which the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.:) have been promised: Underneath it rivers flow, its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end (final destination) of the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.:), and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.

    "Those to whom We have given the Book (such as ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and other Jews who embraced Islâm), rejoice at what has been revealed unto you (i.e. the Qur’ân), but there are among the Confederates (from the Jews and pagans) those who reject a part thereof. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): \"I am commanded only to worship Allâh (Alone) and not to join partners with Him. To Him (Alone) I call and to Him is my return.\"",
    "And thus have We sent it (the Qur’ân) down to be a judgement of authority in Arabic. Were you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to follow their (vain) desires after the knowledge which has come to you, then you will not have any Walî (protector) or Wâq (defender) against Allâh.",
    "And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) and made for them wives and offspring. And it was not for a Messenger to bring a sign except by Allâh’s Leave. (For) every matter there is a Decree (from Allâh). [Tafsir Al-Tabari]",

    "And verily, those before them did devise plots, but all planning is Allâh’s. He knows what every person earns, and the disbelievers will know who gets the good end (final destination).",
    "And those who disbelieved, say: \"You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) are not a Messenger.\" Say: \"Sufficient as a witness between me and you is Allâh and those too who have knowledge of the Scripture (such as ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and other Jews and Christians who embraced Islâm).\"",
    "Alif-Lâm-Râ. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings]. (This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of belief in the Oneness of Allâh and Islâmic Monotheism) by their Lord’s Leave to the Path of the All-Mighty, the Owner of all Praise.",

    "And (remember) when Mûsâ (Moses) said to his people: \"Call to mind Allâh’s Favour to you, when He delivered you from Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) people who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women alive; and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.\"",
    "And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: \"If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allâh), I will give you more (of My Blessings); but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily My punishment is indeed severe.\"",

    "Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of Nûh (Noah), and ‘Âd, and Thamûd? And those after them? None knows them but Allâh. To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths (biting them from anger) and said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism).\"",
    "Their Messengers said: \"What! Can there be a doubt about Allâh, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you (to Monotheism and to be obedient to Allâh) that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed.\" They said: \"You are no more than human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority (i.e. a clear proof of what you say).\"",

    "\"And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing before Me (on the Day of Resurrection or fears My punishment) and also fears My threat.\"",

    "The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day; they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned. That is the straying, far away (from the Right Path).",
    "Do you not see that Allâh has created the heavens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He can remove you and bring (in your place) a new creation!",
    "And for Allâh that is not hard or difficult.",
    "And they all shall appear before Allâh (on the Day of Resurrection); then the weak will say to those who were arrogant (chiefs): \"Verily, we were following you; can you avail us anything against Allâh’s Torment?\" They will say: \"Had Allâh guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference to us (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience; there is no place of refuge for us.\"",
    "And Shaitân (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: \"Verily, Allâh promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allâh (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).\"",
    "And those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh and His Messengers and whatever they brought) and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow, - to dwell therein for ever (i.e. in Paradise), with the Permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: Salâm (peace!).",
    "See you not how Allâh sets forth a parable? A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e. very high).",
    "Giving its fruit at all times, by the Leave of its Lord, and Allâh sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember.",
    "And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth, having no stability.",
    "Allâh will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allâh Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allâh will cause to go astray those who are Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers), and Allâh does what He wills.",
    "Have you not seen those who have changed the Blessings of Allâh into disbelief (by denying Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم and his Message of Islâm), and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction?",
    "Hell, in which they will burn, - and what an evil place to settle in!",
    "And they set up rivals to Allâh, to mislead (men) from His Path! Say: \"Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!\"",
    "Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to ‘Ibâdî (My slaves) who have believed, that they should perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), and spend in charity out of the sustenance We have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.",
    "Allâh is He Who has created the heavens and the earth and sends down water (rain) from the sky, and thereby brought forth fruits as provision for you; and He has made the ships to be of service to you, that they may sail through the sea by His Command; and He has made rivers (also) to be of service to you.",
    "And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses, to be of service to you; and He has made the night and the day, to be of service to you.",
    "And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the Blessings of Allâh, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrong-doer, a disbeliever (an extreme ingrate who denies Allâh’s Blessings by disbelief, and by worshipping others besides Allâh, and by disobeying Allâh and His Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم).",
    "And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: \"O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.",
    "\"O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeys me, still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
    "\"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allâh) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.",
    "\"O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allâh.",
    "\"All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, Who has given me in old age Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) and Ishâq (Isaac). Verily! My Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.",
    "\"O my Lord! Make me one who performs As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât ), and (also) from my offspring, our Lord! And accept my invocation.",
    "\"Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established.\"",
    "Consider not that Allâh is unaware of that which the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.",
    "(They will be) hastening forward with necks outstretched, their heads raised up (towards the sky), their gaze returning not towards them and their hearts empty (from thinking because of extreme fear).",
    "And warn (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrong-doers will say: \"Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!\" (It will be said): \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).",
    "\"And you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves, and it was clear to you how We had dealt with them. And We put forth (many) parables for you.\"",
    "Indeed, they planned their plot, and their plot was with Allâh, though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains (real mountains or the Islâmic law) from their places (as it is of no importance)[Tafsir Ibn Kathir].",
    "So think not that Allâh will fail to keep His Promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.",
    "On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they (all creatures) will appear before Allâh, the One, the Irresistible.",
    "And you will see the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism, polytheists) that Day Muqarranûn (bound together) in fetters.",
    "Their garments will be of pitch, and fire will cover their faces.",
    "That Allâh may requite each person according to what he has earned. Truly, Allâh is Swift at reckoning.",
    "This (Qur’an) is a Message for mankind (and a clear proof against them), in order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is the only One Ilâh (God - Allâh) - (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh) - and that men of understanding may take heed.",
    "Alif-Lâm-Râ. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings].These are Verses of the Book and a plain Qur’ân."
