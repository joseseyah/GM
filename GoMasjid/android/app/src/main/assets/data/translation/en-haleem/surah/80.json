    "He frowned and turned away",
    "when the blind man came to him––",
    "for all you know, he might have grown in spirit,",
    "or taken note of something useful to him.",
    "For the self-satisfied one",
    "you go out of your way––",
    "though you are not to be blamed for his lack of spiritual growth––",
    "but from the one who has come to you full of eagerness",
    "and awe",
    "you allow yourself to be distracted.",
    "No indeed! This [Quran] is a lesson",
    "from which those who wish to be taught should learn,",
    "[written] on honoured,",
    "exalted, pure pages,",
    "by the hands of",
    "noble and virtuous scribes.",
    "Woe to man! How ungrateful he is!",
    "From what thing does God create him?",
    "He creates him from a droplet, He proportions him,",

    "olive trees, date palms,",
    "luscious gardens,",
    "fruits, and fodder:",
    "all for you and your livestock to enjoy.",
    "When the Deafening Blast comes––",
    "the Day man will flee from his own brother,",
    "his mother, his father,",
    "his wife, his children:",
    "each of them will be absorbed in concerns of their own on that Day-",
    "on that Day some faces will be beaming,",
    "laughing, and rejoicing,",
    "but some faces will be dust-stained",
    "and covered in darkness:",
    "those are the disbelievers, the licentious."
