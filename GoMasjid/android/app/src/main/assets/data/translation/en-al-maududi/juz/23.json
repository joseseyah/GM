    "Why should I not serve the One Who created me and to Whom all of you shall be sent back?",
    "What! Shall I take any deities apart from Him whose intercession will not avail me the least were the Merciful One to bring any adversity upon me, nor will they be able to rescue me?",
    "Surely in that case I should indeed be in evident error.",
    "I believe in your Lord; so listen to me.”",
    "(Eventually they killed him and he was told): “Enter Paradise.” The man exclaimed: “Would that my people knew",
    "for what reason Allah has forgiven me and placed me among the honoured ones.”",
    "After him, We did not send down any hosts from the heaven; We stood in no need to send down any host.",
    "There was but a single Blast and suddenly they became silent and still.",
    "Alas for My servants! Never does a Messenger come to them but they mock him.",
    "Have they not seen how many nations before them did We destroy? Thereafter they never came back to them.",
    "All of them shall (one day) be gathered before Us.",
    "Let the dead earth be a Sign for them. We gave it life and produced from it grain whereof they eat.",
    "We made in it gardens of date-palms and vines, and We caused springs to gush forth",
    "that they might eat of its fruits. It was not their hands that made them. Will they not, then, give thanks?",
    "Holy is He Who created all things in pairs, whether it be of what the earth produces, and of themselves, and of what they do not know.",
    "And the night is another Sign for them. We strip the day from it and they become plunged in darkness.",
    "The sun is running its course to its appointed place. That is the ordaining of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.",
    "We have appointed stages for the moon till it returns in the shape of a dry old branch of palm-tree.",
    "Neither does it lie in the sun's power to overtake the moon nor can the night outstrip the day. All glide along, each in its own orbit.",
    "Another Sign for them is that We carried all their offspring in the laden vessel",
    "and then created for them other vessels like those on which they ride.",
    "Should We so wish, We can drown them, and there will be none to heed their cries of distress, nor will they be rescued.",
    "It is only Our Mercy (that rescues them) and enables enjoyment of life for a while.",
    "When it is said to such people: “Guard yourselves against what is ahead of you and what has preceded you that mercy be shown to you” (they pay scant heed to it).",
    "Never does any Sign of their Lord come to them, but they turn away from it.",
    "And when it is said to them: “Spend (in the Way of Allah) out of the sustenance that Allah has provided you,” the unbelievers say to the believers: “Shall we feed him whom, Allah would have fed, had He so wished?” Say: “You are in evident error.”",
    "They say: “When will this threat (of Resurrection) come to pass? Tell us if indeed you are truthful.”",
    "The Truth is that they are waiting for nothing but a mighty Blast to seize them the while they are disputing (in their worldly affairs),",
    "and they will not even be able to make a testament, nor to return to their households.",
    "Then the Trumpet shall be blown and lo! they will come out of their graves and be on the move towards their Lord,",
    "(nervously) exclaiming. “Alas for us! Who roused us out of our sleeping-place?” “This is what the Merciful One had promised, and what (His) Messengers had said was true.”",
    "Then there will simply be one single Blast, and all will have gathered before Us.",
    "Today no one shall suffer the least injustice, and you shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds.",
    "Indeed, the people of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves:",
    "they and their spouses shall be reclining on their couches in shady groves;",
    "therein there will be all kinds of fruits to eat, and they shall have all that they desire.",
    "“Peace” shall be the word conveyed to them from their Merciful Lord.",
    "“Criminals, separate yourselves from others today!",
    "Children of Adam, did I not command you not to serve Satan � he is to you an open enemy",
    "and serve Me alone: this is the Straight Way?",
    "Still, he misguided a whole throng of you. Did you have no sense?",
    "Now this is the Hell of which you were warned.",
    "Burn in it on account of your disbelieving.",
    "Today We shall put a seal on their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us and their feet shall bear witness to what they had been doing.",
    "If We so willed, We would have put out their eyes, then they would rush to see the Way, but how would they be able to see?",
    "If We so willed, We would have transformed them where they were so that they would not go forward or backward.",
    "Whomsoever We grant a long life, We reverse him in his constitution. Do they still not understand?",
    "We did not teach him (to wit, the Messenger) poetry and it does not behove him. This is none but an Admonition, and a Clear Book",
    "that he may warn him who is alive and establish an argument against those that deny the Truth.",
    "Do they not see Our handiwork: We created for them cattle which they own?",
    "We have subjected the cattle to them so that some of them they ride and eat the flesh of others.",
    "They derive a variety of benefits and drinks from them. Will they, then, not give thanks?",
    "They set up deities apart from Allah, hoping that they will receive help from them.",
    "Those deities can render them no help. Yet these devotees act as though they were an army in waiting for them.",
    "Let not their words grieve you. Surely We know all things about them, what they conceal and what they reveal.",
    "Does man not see that We created him of a sperm drop, and lo! he is flagrantly contentious?",
    "He strikes for Us a similitude and forgot his own creation. He says: “Who will quicken the bones when they have decayed?”",
    "Say: “He Who first brought them into being will quicken them; He knows well about every kind of creation;",
    "He Who created from a green tree a fire for you, a fire to light your stoves with.”",
    "Has He Who created the heavens and the earth no power to create the likes of them? Yes, indeed, He is the Superb Creator.",
    "Whenever He wills a thing, He just commands it “Be” and it is.",
    "Holy is He Who has full control over everything, and to Him you shall all be recalled.",
    "By those who range themselves in rows;",
    "by those who reprove severely,",
    "and those who recite the Exhortation;",
    "surely your God is One,",
    "the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever lies between the two, the Lord of the Easts.",
    "We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars",
    "and have protected it from every rebellious satan.",
    "These satans cannot listen to what transpires in the High Council for they are pelted away from every side",
    "and are repelled. Theirs is an unceasing chastisement.",
    "And if any is able to snatch a fragment, he is pursued by a piercing flame.",
    "So ask them (that is, human beings): “Were they harder to create than the objects We created?” We created them from sticky clay.",
    "You marvel (at the wondrous creations of Allah) and they scoff at it,",
    "and when they are admonished, they pay no heed;",
    "and if they see any Sign, they laugh it away",
    "and say: “This is nothing but plain sorcery.",
    "Is it ever possible that after we die and are reduced to dust and (a skeleton of) bones, we will be raised to life?",
    "And so also shall our forefathers of yore be raised to life?”",
    "Tell them: “Yes; and you are utterly helpless (against Allah).”",
    "There will be a single stern rebuff and lo, they will be observing with their own eyes (all that they had been warned against).",
    "They will then say: “Woe for us. This is the Day of Judgement.”",
    "“Yes, this is the Day of Final Decision that you used to deny as a lie.”",
    "(Then will the command be given): “Muster all the wrong-doers and their spouses and the deities whom they used to serve",
    "apart from Allah, and direct them to the path of Hell,",
    "and detain them there; they will be called to account.",
    "How is it that you are not helping one another?",
    "Indeed, today they are surrendering themselves completely.”",
    "They will then turn towards each other (and start wrangling).",
    "(The followers will say to their leaders): “You used to come to us from the right hand.”",
    "They will say: “Nay, you yourselves were not the ones who would believe.",
    "We had no power over you. You were a rebellious people,",
    "and so we became deserving of the Word of our Lord that we shall be made to suffer chastisement.",
    "So we led you astray; we ourselves were strayed.”",
    "On that Day, they will all share the chastisement.",
    "Thus do We treat the culprits.",
    "Whenever it was said to them: “There is no true deity apart from Allah,” they waxed proud",
    "and said: “Shall we forsake our deities for the sake of a distracted poet?”",
    "(They say so although) he brought the Truth and confirmed the veracity of the Messengers.",
    "(They will be told): “You shall taste the grievous chastisement.",
    "You will only be recompensed according to your deeds.”",
    "But Allah's chosen servants (shall be spared this woeful end).",
    "For them awaits a known provision,",
    "a variety of delicious fruits; and they shall be honoured",
    "in the Gardens of Bliss.",
    "They will be seated upon couches set face to face;",
    "a cup filled with wine from its springs, will be passed around to them;",
    "white, sparkling (wine), a delight to the drinkers.",
    "There will neither be any harm in it for their body nor will it intoxicate their mind.",
    "Theirs shall be wide-eyed maidens with bashful, restrained glances,",
    "so delicate as the hidden peel under an egg's shell.",
    "Then some of them will turn to others, and will ask each other.",
    "One of them will say: “I had a companion in the world",
    "who used to say: �Are you also one of those who confirm the Truth (of life after death)?",
    "After we are dead and have become all dust and bones shall we still be requited?'",
    "He will say: �Do you wish to know where he is now?'",
    "Then he will look downwards, and will see him in the depths of Hell.",
    "He will say to him: �By Allah, you almost ruined me.",
    "But for Allah's favour, I should be one of those who have been mustered here.",
    "So, are we not going to die,",
    "except for our first death? And shall we suffer no chastisement?'”",
    "Surely this is the supreme triumph.",
    "For the like of it should the workers work.",
    "Is this a better hospitality or the tree of al-Zaqqum?",
    "We have made this tree a trial for the wrong-doers.",
    "It is a tree that grows in the nethermost part of Hell.",
    "Its spathes are like the heads of satans.",
    "(The people of Hell) will surely eat of it, filling their bellies with it.",
    "Then on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water.",
    "Then their return will be to the same blazing Hell.",
    "These are the ones who found their fathers steeped in error,",
    "and they are running in their footsteps.",
    "Before them a multitude of people of olden times had erred,",
    "and We had sent among them Messengers to warn them.",
    "Observe, then, what was the end of those that had been warned,",
    "except for the chosen servants of Allah?",
    "Noah had called upon Us (earlier). See, how excellent We were in answering him!",
    "We delivered him and his household from the great calamity;",
    "and made his offspring the only ones to survive,",
    "and We established for him a good name among posterity.",
    "Peace be upon Noah among all the nations.",
    "Thus do We reward all those who do good.",
    "Surely he was one of Our truly believing servants.",
    "Thereafter We caused the others to be drowned.",
    "Abraham was on the self-same way (as Noah).",
    "When he came to his Lord with a pure heart,",
    "and said to his father and his people: “Whom do you worship?",
    "Is it false deities that you want to serve rather than Allah?",
    "What do you think of the Lord of the whole Universe?”",
    "Then he looked carefully at the stars",
    "and said: “I am sick.”",
    "So turning their backs, they went away from him.",
    "Then he went quietly to the (temple of the deities) and said: “What is the matter with you, why do you not eat?",
    "What is the matter with you, why do you not speak?”",
    "Then he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand,",
    "whereupon people came to him running.",
    "Abraham said to them: “Do you worship what you yourselves have carved with your own hands",
    "while it is Allah Who has created you and all that you make?”",
    "They spoke among themselves: “Build him a pyre and then throw him into the furnace.”",
    "They had contrived an evil plan against him, but We abased them all.",
    "Abraham said: “I am going to my Lord; He will guide me.",
    "Lord, grant me a righteous son.”",
    "(In response to this prayer) We gave him the good news of a prudent boy;",
    "and when he was old enough to go about and work with him, (one day) Abraham said to him: “My son, I see in my dream that I am slaughtering you. So consider (and tell me) what you think.” He said: “Do as you are bidden. You will find me, if Allah so wills, among the steadfast.”",
    "When both surrendered (to Allah's command) and Abraham flung the son down on his forehead,",
    "We cried out: “O Abraham,",
    "you have indeed fulfilled your dream. Thus do We reward the good-doers.”",
    "This was indeed a plain trial.",
    "And We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice,",
    "and We preserved for him a good name among posterity.",
    "Peace be upon Abraham.",
    "Thus do We reward the good-doers.",
    "Surely he was one of Our believing servants.",
    "And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet and among the righteous ones.",
    "And We blessed him and Isaac. Among the offspring of the two some did good and some plainly wronged themselves.",
    "Verily We bestowed Our favours on Moses and Aaron",
    "and We delivered both of them and their people from the great calamity.",
    "We succoured them, and they gained the upper hand (against their enemies).",
    "We granted them a Clear Book,",
    "and showed them the Straight Way,",
    "and preserved for them a good name among posterity.",
    "Peace be upon Moses and Aaron.",
    "Thus do We reward the good-doers.",
    "Surely both of them were among Our believing servants.",
    "Surely, Elias too was among the Messengers.",
    "(Call to mind) when he said to his people: “Will you not fear Allah?",
    "Do you call upon Baal and forsake the Best of the Creators?",
    "Allah is your Lord and the Lord of your ancestors of yore.”",
    "But they denounced him as a liar, so they will surely be arraigned (for punishment),",
    "except Allah's chosen servants.",
    "We preserved a good name for him among posterity.",
    "Peace be upon Elias.",
    "Thus do We reward the good-doers.",
    "He was one of Our believing servants.",
    "And Lot too was one of the Messengers.",
    "(Call to mind) when We delivered him and all his kinsfolk,",
    "except for an old woman who was among those that stayed behind.",
    "Then We utterly destroyed the rest of them.",
    "You pass by their desolate habitations in the morning",
    "and at night. Do you still not understand?",
    "And Jonah too was one of the Messengers.",
    "Call to mind when he fled to the laden ship,",
    "cast lots, and was among the losers.",
    "Then a fish swallowed him, and he was blameworthy.",
    "Had he not been one of those who glorify Allah,",
    "he would certainly have remained in its belly till the Day of Resurrection.",
    "But We threw him on a wide bare tract of land while he was ill;",
    "and caused a gourd tree to grow over him,",
    "and We sent him forth to a nation of a hundred thousand or more,",
    "and they believed. So We let them enjoy life for a while.",
    "So ask their opinion: “(Are you convinced) that your Lord should have daughters and you should have sons?",
    "Did We create the angels as females the while they witnessed?”",
    "Behold, it is one of their fabrications that they say:",
    "“Allah has begotten.” They are liars!",
    "Did He choose daughters rather than sons?",
    "What is the matter with you that you make such strange judgements?",
    "Will you then not take heed?",
    "Do you have any clear authority for such claims?",
    "Bring your Book, if you are truthful.",
    "They have established a kinship between Allah and the angels; and the angels know well that these people will be arraigned (as culprits).",
    "(They say): “Exalted be Allah above what they attribute to Him,",
    "all of them except the chosen servants of Allah.",
    "So you and your deities",
    "shall not be able to tempt anyone away from Allah",
    "except him who shall roast in the Blazing Fire.",
    "As for us, there is none but has an appointed station.",
    "Verily we range ourselves in rows (as humble servants)",
    "and we are of those who glorify Allah.”",
    "They used to say before:",
    "“If only we had the Reminder which had been granted to the people of yore",
    "we would surely have been Allah's chosen servants.”",
    "But when it came to them, they rejected it. They shall soon come to know (the end of such an attitude).",
    "We have already given Our promise to Our Messengers",
    "that they shall certainly be succoured,",
    "and that Our hosts shall triumph.",
    "So, (O Prophet), leave them alone for a while,",
    "and see, and soon they too shall see.",
    "Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?",
    "When that chastisement will descend upon their courtyard, evil shall that Day be for those who had been warned.",
    "Leave them alone for a while,",
    "and see; and they too shall soon see.",
    "Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory, above what they attribute to Him,",
    "and peace be upon the Messengers,",
    "and all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.",
    "Sad, and by the Qur'an full of exhortation!",
    "Nay, but the unbelievers are steeped in arrogance and stubborn defiance.",
    "How many a nation did We destroy before them! (When they approached their doom) they cried out (for deliverance), but the time for deliverance was already past.",
    "They wondered that a warner had come to them from among themselves,and the deniers of the Truth said: “This is a sorcerer, and a big liar.",
    "Has he made the gods one single God? This is truly astounding.”",
    "And the elders among them went forth saying: “Go ahead and be steadfast in adhering to your deities. What is being said is with a design.”",
    "We have not heard this in the religious community close to our time. This is nothing but a fabrication.",
    "Has this Exhortation been sent down among us only to him, to the exclusion of all others?” Nay, they are in doubt regarding My Exhortation, and are saying all this because they have not yet had any taste of My chastisement.",
    "Do they possess the treasures of your Lord, the Most Mighty, the Great Bestower?",
    "Or do they possess the dominion of the heavens and the earth and of all that is in between them? If so, let them ascend the heights of the realm of causation and see!",
    "This is only a small army out of the several armies that will suffer defeat here.",
    "Before them the people of Noah, Ad, and Pharaoh of the tent-pegs gave the lie (to the Messengers)",
    "and so did Thamud and the people of Lot and the people of Aykah. These were all leagued together.",
    "Each of them gave the lie to Messengers and My decree of chastisement came upon them.",
    "They are waiting for nothing except a single Cry, after which there will be no second Cry.",
    "They say: “Our Lord, hasten to us our share (of chastisement) before the Day of Reckoning.”",
    "(O Prophet), bear with patience what they say, and call to mind Our servant David, who was endowed with great strength and who constantly turned (to Allah).",
    "With him We had subjected the mountains that they join him in celebrating Allah's glory, evening and morning,",
    "and the birds, too, in their flocks, and turn again and again to celebrating Allah's glory.",
    "And We strengthened his kingdom and endowed him with wisdom and decisive judgement.",
    "Has the story of the litigants reached you � of those who entered his private chambers by climbing over the wall?",
    "As they came upon David � and he was frightened of them � they said: “Be not afraid. We are just two litigants: one of us has committed excess against the other. So judge rightly between us, and be not unjust; and guide us to the Right Way.",
    "Behold, this is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one ewe.” And yet he said: “Give her into my charge,” and he got the better of me in argument.",
    "David said: “He has certainly wronged you in seeking to add your ewe to his ewes; and indeed many who live together commit excesses, one to the other, except those that believe and act righteously; and they are but few.” (While so saying) David realized that it is We Who have put him to test; therefore, he sought the forgiveness of his Lord, and fell down, bowing and penitently turning (to Him).",
    "Thereupon We forgave him his shortcoming and indeed (an exalted position of) nearness awaits him, and an excellent resort.",
    "(We said to him): “O David, We have appointed you vicegerent on earth. Therefore, rule among people with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it should lead you astray from Allah's Path. Allah's severe chastisement awaits those who stray away from Allah's Path, for they had forgotten the Day of Reckoning.",
    "We did not create this heaven and earth and all that lies between them in vain. That is the fancy of those who denied the Truth. So woe from the Fire to all who deny the Truth.",
    "Shall We then treat alike those that believe and act righteously and those that create mischief on earth? Or treat alike the God-fearing and the wicked?",
    "This is the Blessed Book that We have revealed to you, (O Muhammad), that people with understanding may reflect over its verses and those with understanding derive a lesson.",
    "We bestowed upon David (an illustrious son), Solomon. How excellent a servant (of Ours he was)! Indeed he constantly turned to Us in devotion.",
    "And when one evening well-trained and running horses of noble breed were brought to him",
    "he said: “Lo! I have come to love this wealth on account of the remembrance of my Lord.” And when the horses disappeared,",
    "(he ordered): “Bring these horses back to me,” and then he began to gently stroke their shanks and necks.",
    "Surely We put Solomon to the test and cast upon his throne a mere body. Thereupon he penitently turned (to Us).",
    "He said: “My Lord, forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom such as none other after me will deserve. Surely You are the Bounteous Giver.”",
    "We subjected the wind to him, so that it blew gently at his bidding, wherever he directed it,",
    "and We also subjected the devils to him � all kinds of builders and divers;",
    "and others that were bound with chains.",
    "“This is Our bestowal. So give or withhold as you wish without account.”",
    "Indeed an exalted position of nearness awaits him and an excellent resort.",
    "And remember Our servant Job: when he cried to his Lord: “Behold, Satan has afflicted me with much hardship and suffering.”",
    "(We commanded him): “Stamp your foot on earth, and here is cool water to wash with and to drink.”",
    "And We granted to him his family and also the like of them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to people of understanding,",
    "(and We said to him): “Take in your hand a bundle of rushes and strike with it, and do not break your oath.” Indeed We found him steadfast. How excellent a servant (of Ours) he was. Indeed he constantly turned (to his Lord).",
    "And remember Our servants � Abraham, Isaac and Jacob � they were endowed with great strength and vision.",
    "Verily We exalted them in consideration of a sterling quality: their remembrance of the Abode of the Hereafter.",
    "In Our sight they are among the chosen and excellent ones.",
    "And remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhu al-Kifl.All were of the best.",
    "This was a remembrance. An excellent retreat awaits the God-fearing",
    "� everlasting Gardens with gates wide open for them",
    "wherein they shall recline, wherein they shall ask for abundant fruit and drinks,",
    "and wherein there shall be with them well-matched, bashful mates.",
    "All this is what you are promised for the Day of Judgement.",
    "This is Our provision for you, never to end.",
    "All this (is for the God-fearing). But for the transgressors, an evil resort awaits them �",
    "Hell, where they will be roasted. An evil place to dwell!",
    "All this (is for them); so let them taste boiling water and pus,",
    "and other sufferings of the kind.",
    "(Observing their followers advancing to Hell they will say, among themselves: “This is a troop rushing in to you. There is no welcome for them. They are destined to roast in the Fire.”",
    "They will reply: “Rather, no welcome to you. (You will roast in Hell.) It is you who led us to this end. What an evil resort!”",
    "They will say: “Our Lord, give twofold punishment in the Fire to him who has led us to this.”",
    "They will say to one another: “But why do we not see those whom we considered him among the wicked?",
    "Is it that we mistakenly made fun of them; or have they disappeared from our sight?”",
    "Verily all this is true. This is how the inmates of the Fire will dispute among themselves.",
    "Tell them, (O Prophet): “I am nothing but a warner. There is no deity but Allah, the One, the Supreme,",
    "the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is in between them, the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving.”",
    "Say: “This is a tiding of tremendous import",
    "from which you are turning away.”",
    "(Tell them): “I had no knowledge of the High Council when they were disputing.",
    "I am told (about matters) by means of revelation only because I am a clear warner.”",
    "When your Lord said to the angels: “Verily I am creating a human being from clay.",
    "After I have created him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall you down, prostrating yourselves to him.”",
    "Then the angels, all of them, prostrated themselves before Adam",
    "except Iblis. He waxed proud and became one of the unbelievers.",
    "The Lord said: “O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating yourself before him whom I created of My Two Hands. Are you waxing proud, or fancy yourself to be too exalted?”",
    "He replied: “I am nobler than he. You created me from fire and created him from clay.”",
    "He said: “Get out of here; surely you are accursed,",
    "and My curse shall remain upon you till the Day of Resurrection.”",
    "Satan said: “My Lord, then grant me respite till the Day that they are raised up.”",
    "He said: “You are of those who have been granted respite",
    "till the Day whose Hour I know.”",
    "(Iblis) said: “By Your glory, I shall mislead them all",
    "except those of Your servants, the chosen ones from amongst them.”",
    "He (i.e. Allah) said: “This is the Truth � and I only speak the Truth �",
    "I will certainly fill the Gehenna with you and with all those among them who follow you.”",
    "(O Prophet), tell them: “I do not ask you for any recompense for the performance of this task; nor am I given to affectation.",
    "This is nothing but an Admonition for all people the world over.",
    "You will know the truth of the matter after a while.”",
    "The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Most Mighty, the Most Wise.",
    "(O Prophet), it is We Who have revealed this Book to you with Truth. So serve only Allah, consecrating your devotion to Him.",
    "Lo, religion is exclusively devoted to Allah. Your religion is entirely consecrated to Him. As for those who have taken others than Allah for their guardians, (they say): “We worship them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between them concerning what they differ about. Verily Allah does not guide anyone who is given to sheer lying, is an utter unbeliever.",
    "If Allah had wanted to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen anyone He wanted out of those whom He creates. Glory be to Him (that He should have a son). He is Allah: the One, the Overpowering.",
    "He created the heavens and the earth with Truth, and He folds up the day over the night and folds up the night over the day. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each is running its course until an appointed time. Lo, He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving.",
    "He it is Who created you from a single being, and He it is Who made from it its mate. He it is Who created for you eight heads of cattle in pairs. He creates you in your mothers' wombs, giving you one form after another in threefold depths of darkness. That, then, is Allah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is no god but He. So, whence are you being turned astray?",
    "If you disbelieve, know well that Allah has no need of you. Yet He does not like unbelief in His servants. But if you are thankful, your thankfulness will please Him. No one shall bear another's burden. You are destined to return to your Lord and He will tell you what you used to do. He is well aware even of what lies hidden in your breasts.",
    "When any affliction befalls man, he cries out to his Lord, penitently turning to Him. But when his Lord bestows His favour upon him, he forgets the affliction regarding which he had cried out and sets up compeers to Allah that they may lead others astray from His Path. Say, (O Prophet): “Enjoy your unbelief for a while. Surely you will be among the inmates of the Fire.”",
    "Is such a person (preferable or he) who is obedient, and prostrates himself in the watches of the night, stands (in Prayer), is fearful of the Hereafter, and looks forward to the mercy of His Lord? Ask them: “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” Only those endowed with understanding take heed.",
    "Tell them (O Prophet): “O you servants of Mine who believe, have fear of your Lord. A good end awaits those who did good in this world. Allah's earth is spacious. Verily those who persevere shall be granted their reward beyond all reckoning.”",
    "Tell them, (O Prophet): “I am bidden to serve Allah, consecrating my devotion to Him,",
    "and I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender to Him.”",
    "Say: “If I disobey my Lord, I fear the chastisement of an Awesome Day.”",
    "Say: “Allah alone shall I serve, consecrating my devotion to Him.",
    "So serve, apart from Him, whomsoever you please.” Say: “Behold, the real losers shall be those who will have lost their own selves and their kith and kin on the Day of Resurrection. Behold, that is the obvious loss.",
    "There shall be sheets of fire above them and beneath them. This is the end against which Allah warns His servants. So dread My wrath, O you servants of Mine!”",
    "(On the other hand), good tidings await those who eschew serving false gods and penitently return to Allah. (O Prophet), give good tidings to My servants,",
    "to those who pay heed to what is said and follow the best of it. They are the ones whom Allah has guided to the Right Way; they are the ones endowed with understanding.",
    "(O Prophet), can you save him (from chastisement) against whom the sentence of chastisement has become due; him who has, (as it were), already fallen into the Fire?”",
    "But those who fear their Lord shall have lofty mansions built over one another beneath which rivers flow. This is Allah's promise and never does Allah fail to fulfil His promise.",
    "Do you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky, then made it flow on earth as springs and streams and rivers and then with it He brings forth vegetation of various hues; then this vegetation ripens and dries up, turning yellow, whereafter He reduces it to broken straw? Surely there is a lesson in this for those endowed with understanding.",
    "Can he whose breast Allah has opened up for Islam and who is thus (moving along a Path) illumined by a light from Allah (be likened to him who derives no lesson from what he observes)? Woe, then, to those whose hearts were further hardened after Allah's admonition. Such are indeed in obvious error.",
    "Allah has revealed the best teaching, a self-consistent Book which repeats its contents in manifold forms whereat shiver the skins of those that hold their Lord in awe, and then their skins and their hearts soften for Allah's remembrance. That is Allah's Guidance wherewith He guides whosoever He pleases. And he whom Allah does not guide to the Right Path has none to guide him.",
    "How woeful is the plight of him who has nothing except his face to shield him from severe chastisement on the Day of Resurrection? Such evil-doers shall be told: “Taste now the consequence of your deeds.”",
    "Their predecessors gave the lie to the Truth and then chastisement came upon them from whence they could not imagine.",
    "So Allah made them taste degradation in the life of this world, and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter will be much more grievous. Would that they knew!",
    "We have indeed propounded for mankind all kinds of parables in this Qur'an that they may take heed.",
    "It is an Arabic Qur'an free of all crookedness that they may guard against their evil end.",
    "Allah propounds a parable: there is a man whose ownership is shared by several quarrelsome masters, each pulling him to himself; and there is another who is exclusively owned by one man. Can the two be alike? All praise and thanks be to Allah. But most of them are unaware.",
    "(O Prophet), you are destined to die and they too are destined to die.",
    "Then eventually all of you will contend before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection."
