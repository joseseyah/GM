    "Alif, Lām , Mīm .",
    "The Romans have been defeated",
    "in the nearer land; and they, after their defeat, will triumph",
    "within a few years. To Allah belonged the matter before and (to Him it belongs) thereafter. And on that day the believers will rejoice",
    "with Allah’s help. He helps whomsoever He wills. And He is the Mighty, the Very-Merciful.",
    "It is a promise from Allah. Allah does not fail in His promise, but most of the people do not know.",
    "They know something superficial of the worldly life, but of the Hereafter they are negligent.",
    "Did they not reflect in their own selves? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them but with a just cause and for an appointed time. Yet many of the people are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.",
    "Have they not traveled on earth to see how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they had tilled the land and had made it more populous than these have made it, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs. So Allah was not such as could do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to themselves.",
    "Then the end of those who did evil was evil, because they rejected the verses of Allah and used to make mockery of them.",
    "Allah originates the creation, then He will create it again, then to Him you are to be returned.",
    "On the day when the Hour (Qiyāmah : the Day of Judgement)) will take place, the guilty will be taken aback in grief and despair.",
    "They will have no intercessors from among their (so-called) ‘partners of Allah’, and they themselves will reject their (such) ‘partners’.",
    "And the day when the Hour (Qiyāmah : the Day of Judgement)) will take place-it will be on that day that they will turn into separate groups.",
    "Then, those who had believed and had done righteous deeds-they will be in a garden, extremely delighted.",
    "As for those who had disbelieved and rejected Our verses and the meeting of the Hereafter, they will be brought for punishment.",
    "So, proclaim Allah’s purity (from shirk) when you see the evening and when you see the morning.",
    "And to Him be praise in the heavens and the earth, and in the afternoon and when you enter the time of àuhr (soon after the decline of the sun towards West).",
    "He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living, and gives life to the land after it is dead. And in similar way you will be brought out (from graves).",
    "It is among His signs that He has created you from dust, then soon you are human beings scattered around.",
    "And it is among His signs that He has created for you wives from among yourselves, so that you may find tranquility in them, and He has created love and kindness between you. Surely in this there are signs for a people who reflect.",
    "And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your tongues and colors. Surely in this there are signs for the persons having knowledge.",
    "And among His signs is your sleep by night and day, and your search for His grace. Surely in this there are signs for a people who listen.",
    "And it is among His signs that He shows you the lightning which causes fear and hope, and that He sends down water from the sky, then He revives the earth with it after its death. Surely in this there are signs for a people who understand.",
    "And it is among His signs that the sky and the earth stand firm by His command. Then, when He will call you from the earth, by a single call, you will be coming out all at once.",
    "To Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth. All (of them) are obedient to Him.",
    "It is He who originates the creation, then will create it again; and it is easier for Him. His is the highest description in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.",
    "He (Allah) gives you an example from yourselves: Do you have, from among your slaves, any partners in the wealth that We have given to you, so as they and you are equal in it, (and) so as you fear them like you fear each other? This is how We explain the signs for a people who understand.",
    "But the wrongdoers have followed their desires without knowledge. So who can guide the one whom Allah leaves astray? For such people there are no helpers.",
    "So, set your face to the Faith uprightly, this (faith) being the nature designed by Allah on which He has created the mankind. There is no change in Allah’s creation. That is the straight faith, but most of the people do not know.",
    "(Set your face to the Faith) turning totally towards Him, and fear Him, and establish Salāh, and do not be among those who associate partners with Allah",
    "- among those who split up their religion and became sects. Each group is happy with what it has before it.",
    "When the people are visited by some affliction, they invoke their Lord with exclusive concentration on Him. Then once He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them starts at once ascribing partners to their Lord,",
    "so as to become ungrateful for what We gave to them. So enjoy yourselves awhile; then you will soon come to know.",
    "Is it that We have sent down to them any authority that speaks to them about their associating partners with Him?",
    "When We give people a taste of mercy, they are happy with it, and if they are touched by an evil because of what their hands sent ahead, they are at once in despair.",
    "Did they not see that Allah extends provision to whomsoever He wills, and straitens (it for whomsoever He wills)? Surely in this there are signs for a people who believe.",
    "So give to the kinsman his right, and to the needy and the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek Allah’s pleasure, and it is they who will be successful.",
    "Whatever Ribā (increased amount) you give, so that it may increase in the wealth of the people, it does not increase with Allah; and whatever Zakāh you give, seeking Allah’s pleasure with it, (it is multiplied by Allah, and) it is such people who multiply (their wealth in real terms.)",
    "Allah is the One who created you, then gave sustenance to you, then He will make you dead, then He will make you alive. Is there any one from your (so-called) ‘partners of God’ who can do anything of that (kind)? Pure is He, and far higher than what they associate (with Him).",
    "Calamities have appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of the people have earned, so that He (Allah) makes them taste some of what they did, in order that they may return (to the right way).",
    "Say, “Go about in the land, and see how was the end of those who were before. Most of them were Mushriks (i.e. those who ascribe partners to Allah)”.",
    "Then set your face to the straight Faith before the arrival of a day that will never be repulsed by Allah. On that Day the people will be split apart.",
    "Whoever disbelieves, his unbelief will be against him; and whoever acts righteously, then such people are paving the path for themselves,",
    "so that Allah may give reward, out of His grace, to those who believed and did righteous deeds. Surely He does not love the unbelievers.",
    "And among His signs is that He sends winds giving good news (of rain), and so that He gives you a taste of His mercy, and that the ships may sail with His command, and that you may search for His grace, and you may be grateful.",
    "We had indeed sent before you messengers to their people. So they came to them with clear proofs. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty; and it was due on Us to help the believers.",
    "Allah is the One who sends the winds, so they stir up a cloud, then He spreads it in the sky however He wills, and makes it (split) into pieces. Then you see the rain coming out from its midst. So, once He makes it reach those whom He wills from His slaves, they start rejoicing,",
    "even though they were absolutely hopeless before it was sent down to them.",
    "So, look to the effects of Allah’s mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death. Surely, That (Allah) is the One who will give life to the dead; and He has the power to do everything.",
    "Should We send a (harmful) wind, and they see it (the tillage) turning yellow, then they will turn ungrateful, even after all the aforesaid (bounties of Allah).",
    "So, you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs in retreat.",
    "Nor are you (able) to show the right path to the blind against their straying. You can make none to listen except those who believe in Our signs, hence they submit.",
    "Allah is the One who created you in a state of weakness, then He created strength after weakness, then created weakness and old age after strength. He creates what He wills, and He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.",
    "And on the Day when the Hour (Qiyāmah : the Day of Judgement) will take place, the sinners will swear that they did not remain (in the graves) more than one hour. In the similar way they used to be contrary (to truth in their worldly life).",
    "As for those who were given knowledge and belief, they will say, “You remained, according to the destiny written by Allah, up to the Day of Resurrection. So this is the Day of Resurrection, but you had no belief.”",
    "So, on that Day, their apology will not benefit the wrongdoers, nor will they be asked to repent.",
    "Indeed We have given in this Qur’ān all kinds of examples for the benefit of mankind. (Still) if you bring to them a sign, the disbelievers will certainly say, “You are nothing but men of falsehood.”",
    "Thus Allah seals up the hearts of those who do not believe.",
    "So, be patient. Surely Allah’s promise is true, and let not the disbelievers shake your firmness."
