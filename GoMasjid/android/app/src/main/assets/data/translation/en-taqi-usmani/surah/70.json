    "A demanding person has asked for the punishment that is going to befall",
    "the disbelievers; there is no one to avert it,",
    "(and it will come) from Allah, the Lord of the stairways,",
    "to whom ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the length of which is fifty thousand years.",
    "So, observe patience, a good patience.",
    "They see it far off,",
    "and We see it near.",
    "(This punishment will befall) on the Day when the sky will be like dregs of oil,",
    "and the mountains will be like dyed wool,",
    "and no friend will ask about any friend,",
    "(though) they will be made to see each other. A guilty person will desire that he may be able to ransom himself from the torment of that day even by his sons,",
    "and his wife and his brother,",
    "and his kindred that sheltered him,",
    "and all those on earth, then he may redeem himself.",
    "By no means! It is the flaming fire",
    "that will pull out the skin of the scalp.",
    "It will call him who had turned his back and fled away (from the truth)",
    "and accumulated (wealth) and hoarded (it).",
    "Indeed man is created weak in courage,",
    "very upset when touched by evil,",
    "and very niggard when visited by good (fortune),",
    "except the performers of Salāh,",
    "who are regular in their Salāh,",
    "and those in whose riches there is a specified right",
    "for the one who asks and the one who is deprived,",
    "and those who believe in the Day of Judgment as true,",
    "and those who are fearful of the torment of their Lord-",
    "-Indeed the torment of their Lord is not something to be fearless from.-",
    "and those who guard their private parts,",
    "except from their wives and those (slave-girls) owned by their hands,- because they are not to be blamed,",
    "but the one who seeks (sexual gratification) beyond that, then such people are the transgressors,-",
    "and those who are careful about their trusts and covenants,",
    "and those who are upright in their testimonies,",
    "and those who take due care of their Salāh .",
    "Those will be honoured in gardens (of Jannah ).",
    "So what has happened to those who disbelieve that they are rushing towards you",
    "from the right and from the left, in groups?",
    "Does every one of them aspire to be admitted to the garden of bliss?",
    "By no means! We have created them from what they know.",
    "So, I swear by the Lord of the points of sunrise and those of sunset, We are powerful",
    "to bring those better than them in their place, and We are not to be frustrated.",
    "So, leave them involved in pastime and play until they encounter their Day, which they are promised,",
    "the Day they will come out of the graves quickly, as if they were rushing toward idols,",
    "with their eyes downcast, enveloped by ignominy. That is the Day, which they were being promised."
