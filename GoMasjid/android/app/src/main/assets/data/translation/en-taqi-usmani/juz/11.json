    "They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, “Do not make excuses. We shall never believe you. Allah has told us the facts about you. Allah will see what you do, and His Messenger as well. Then you shall be returned to the Knower of the Seen and the Unseen, and He will tell you what you have been doing.”",
    "They will swear by Allah before you when you will go back to them, so that you may ignore their misdeeds. So, just ignore them. They are filth, and their abode is Jahannam, a recompense for what they used to do.",
    "They swear before you, so that you may be pleased with them. So, even if you are pleased with them, Allah will not be pleased with the sinning people.",
    "The Bedouins are often more strict in disbelief and hypocrisy, and are most likely to be ignorant of the limits of what Allah has sent down to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "And among the Bedouins there are those who take what they spend as a fine, and they look forward to the cycles of time to turn against you. Upon those is the evil cycle. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
    "And among the Bedouins there are others who believe in Allah and in the Last Day and take what they spend as a source of nearness to Allah and of prayers from the Messenger. It is indeed a source of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Very Merciful.",
    "As for the first and foremost of the Emigrants (Muhājirīn) and the Supporters (AnSār) and those who followed them in goodness, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will live for ever. That is the supreme achievement.",
    "And among those Bedouins who are around you there are hypocrites, and among the people of Madīnah as well. They are adamant on hypocrisy. You do not know them. We know them. We will chastise them twice, then they shall be driven to a terrible punishment (in the Hereafter).",
    "And there are others who admitted their sins while they had mixed a good deed with an evil one. It is likely that Allah will relent towards them. Surely, Allah is Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.",
    "Take Sadaqah (obligatory alms) out of their wealth through which you may cleanse and purify them, and pray for them. Indeed, your prayer is a source of peace for them. And Allah is (All-) Hearing, (All-) Knowing.",
    "Have they not come to know that Allah is He who accepts repentance from His slaves and accepts Sadaqāt, and that Allah is Most-Relenting, Very-Merciful.",
    "Say, “Do (what you do); Allah will see your deed, as will the Messenger and the believers. And you shall be returned to the Knower of the Seen and the Unseen, then He will tell you what you have been doing.”",
    "And there are others whose matter is deferred till the command of Allah (comes): either He would punish them or relent towards them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "And (there are) those who have built a mosque to cause harm (to Islam) and to promote infidelity and to create dissention among the believers and to provide a station for one who has been at war with Allah and His Messenger even before. They will certainly swear (and say), “We intended to do nothing but good.” Allah testifies that they are liars",
    "Do not ever stand there (in prayer). In fact, the mosque that was founded on Taqwā (piety) from the very first day has greater right that you stand in it. In it there are people who like to observe purity; and Allah loves those observing purity.",
    "Then tell me, which one is better, whether the one who has founded his building on fear of Allah and on search of His pleasure, or the one who has founded his building on the edge of an abyss that is about to collapse, then it did collapse with him into the fire of Jahannam ? Allah does not give guidance to the unjust people.",
    "The building they had built shall always remain a source of unrest in their hearts, unless their hearts are cut into pieces. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "Surely, Allah has bought their lives and their wealth from the believers, in exchange of (a promise) that Paradise shall be theirs. They fight in the way of Allah, and kill and are killed, on which there is a true promise (as made) in the Torah and the Injīl and the Qur’ān. And who can be more faithful to his covenant than Allah? So, rejoice in the deal you have made, and that is the great achievement.",
    "(They are) those who repent, those who worship, those who praise (Allah), those who journey (in Allah’s way), those who bow in Rukū‘, those who prostrate in sajdah, those who bid the Fair and forbid the Unfair and those who preserve the limits prescribed by Allah. And give the good news to the believers.",
    "It is not (permissible) for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the Mushriks, even if they are kinsmen, after it became clear to them that they are the people of hell.",
    "As for the prayer of Ibrāhīm for the forgiveness of his father, it was only due to a promise he had made to him. Later, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he withdrew himself from him. Indeed, Ibrāhīm was very tender-hearted, very forbearing.",
    "Allah is not such as He makes a people go astray after He has given them guidance, unless He explains to them what they should avoid. Indeed, Allah is fully aware of every thing.",
    "Surely, to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and brings death. And, other than Allah, you have neither a supporter, nor a helper.",
    "Surely, Allah has relented towards the Prophet and the Emigrants (Muhajirīn) and the Supporters (the AnSār) who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a group of them were about to turn crooked, then He relented towards them. Surely, to them He is Very-Kind, Very-Merciful.",
    "And (He relented) towards the three whose matter was deferred until when the earth was straitened for them despite all its vastness, and even their own souls were straitened for them, and they realized that there is no refuge from Allah, except in Him, then He turned towards them, so that they may repent. Surely, Allah is the Most-Relenting, the Very Merciful.",
    "O you who believe, fear Allah, and be in the company of the truthful.",
    "It was not (permissible) for the people of Madīnah and for those around them of the Bedouins to stay behind abandoning the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because whatever thirst or fatigue or hunger strikes them in the way of Allah, and whenever they step into a place which infuriates the infidels, and whenever they make a gain from an enemy, a virtuous deed is credited to their account. Surely, Allah does not nullify the reward of the virtuous.",
    "Whatever they spend, be it less or more, and whenever they cross a valley, is all written down for them, so that Allah may give them the best reward for what they used to do.",
    "It is not (necessary) for all the believers to go forth.’; So, why should it not be that a group from every section of them goes forth, so that they may acquire perfect understanding of the Faith, and so that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may take due care (of the rules of Sharī‘ah ).",
    "O you who believe, fight those disbelievers who are near you, and let them find severity in you. Know well that Allah is with the God-fearing.",
    "When a Sūrah is sent down, some of them (the hypocrites) say, “Whose faith from among you has been increased by this?” So far as the believers are concerned, it has certainly increased their faith, and they are quite happy.",
    "As for those who have malady in their hearts, it adds further impurity to their (initial) impurity, and they die infidels.",
    "Do they not see that they are put to trial every year once or twice; still they neither repent, nor do they take lesson?",
    "And when a Sūrah is sent down, they look at each other (as if saying): “Is there someone watching you?” Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts, because they are a people who do not understand.",
    "Surely, there has come to you, from your midst, a Messenger who feels it very hard on him if you face a hardship, who is very anxious for your welfare, and for the believers he is very kind, very merciful.",
    "So, if they turn away, say (O Messenger,) “Enough for me is Allah. There is no god but He. In Him I have placed my trust, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.”",
    "Alif, Lām, Rā . These are verses of the Wise Book.",
    "Is it surprising for the people that We have sent the divine revelation to a man from among them to direct him that he should warn the people (who are heedless), and give happy news to those who believe that they will have a truly excellent footing at a place near their Lord? The disbelievers said, “Surely, he is an open sorcerer.”",
    "Surely, your Lord is Allah, the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then He positioned Himself on the Throne. He governs all affairs (of His creation). There is no one who could intercede before Him, except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord. So, worship Him. Would you still pay no heed?",
    "Towards Him all of you have to return, this being a true promise from Allah. Surely, He originates the creation; then He will bring it again, so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good deeds. As for those who disbelieve, for them there is a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment, because they used to be infidels.",
    "He is the One who has made the sun a glow, and the moon a light, and determined for it stages, so that you may learn the number of the years, and the calculation (of time). Allah has not created all this but for a rightful purpose. He elaborates the signs for a people who understand.",
    "Surely, in the alternation of night and day and in what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a people who are God-fearing.",
    "As for those who do not believe in meeting Us and are quite happy with the life of this world and are content with it, and those who are heedless to Our signs,",
    "they are the ones whose abode is the Fire, because of what they used to earn for themselves.",
    "As for those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord will guide them by virtue of their belief; rivers will be flowing beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss.",
    "Their call therein will be, “Pure are You, O Allah” and their greeting therein will be Salām . And the end of their call will be, “Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.”",
    "And if Allah were to hasten in sending evil to the people, as they hasten in seeking good, their time would have been all over. So, We leave alone those who do not believe in meeting Us to wander blindly in their rebellion.",
    "When man is afflicted by a hardship, he prays to Us (at all times), when reclining or sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship, he just takes his way as though he had never prayed to Us in any hardship that afflicted him. This is how their deeds appear beautified to the transgressors.",
    "Indeed We have destroyed generations before you when they transgressed, and their Messengers had come to them with clear signs, but they were not the ones who would believe. This is how We punish the guilty people.",
    "Then We made you (their) successors in the land, so that We see how you would act.",
    "When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, say those who do not believe in meeting Us, “Bring a Qur’ān other than this, or make changes in it (to suit our fancies)”. Say, “It is not possible for me to make changes in it on my own. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a terrible day.”",
    "Say, “Had Allah so willed, I would have not recited it to you, nor would He have let you know it. Then, I have lived among you for years before it. Have you, then, no sense?”",
    "So, who is more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah or gives the lie to His signs? Indeed (such) guilty people shall not achieve success.",
    "Beside Allah, they worship those who can neither harm nor benefit them, and they say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Say, “Are you informing Allah of what He does not know as existing in the heavens or on the earth?” Pure is He, and far higher than what they associate with Him.",
    "All the people were no more than a single community; later, they differed. But for a word from your Lord that had already come to pass, a decisive judgment would have been made about their mutual differences.",
    "And they say, “Why is it that no sign has been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The Unseen is only for Allah. So, wait. I am waiting with you.”",
    "Once We cause people to taste a blessing after a hardship having afflicted them, they at once start devising plans against Our verses. Say, Allah is swifter in implementing His plan. Indeed, Our messengers (angels) record whatever you intrigue.",
    "He is the One who enables you to travel on land and at sea, until when you are aboard the boats, and they sail with those on board, under a favorable wind, and they are pleased with it, there comes upon them a violent wind, and the wave comes upon them from every direction, and they think that they are surrounded from all sides, they pray to Allah, having faith in Him alone, (and say,) “If You deliver us from this, we shall be grateful indeed.”",
    "But when He delivers them, they at once start rebelling on the earth wrongfully. O people, your rebellion is, in fact, against your own selves. It is only worldly life that you are enjoying. Thereafter, it is to Us that you have to return; then We will tell you what you have been doing.",
    "The example of worldly life is just like the water We sent down from the sky, then the vegetation of the earth grew with it, which is (meant to be) eaten by men and cattle, until when the earth took on its ornament and was fully adorned, and its people thought that they had control over it, Our command came to it at night or by day, and We turned it into a stubble, as if it had not been there a day earlier. This is how We elaborate the verses for a people who reflect.",
    "Allah invites (people) to the Abode of Peace and brings whom He wills to a straight path.",
    "For those who do good there is the best, and something more. Neither gloom shall cover their faces, nor disgrace. Those are the people of Paradise. Therein they shall live forever.",
    "As for those who commit evils, the recompense of each evil shall be similar to that evil, and disgrace shall cover them. For them, there is none to save from Allah. Their faces will seem to be covered with layers of a dark night. Those are the people of the Fire. Therein they shall live forever.",
    "And (be mindful of) the Day when We shall gather them together, then We shall say to those who associated partners with Allah, “Wait in your place, you and your associate-gods.” Then We will cause a split between them, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped.",
    "So, Allah is enough as witness between us and between you. We were totally unaware of your worship.”",
    "Thereupon, everyone shall assess what one had sent ahead, and they will be sent back to Allah, their true Lord, and whatever they used to fabricate will vanish from them.",
    "Say, “Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Or, who controls the (powers of) hearing and seeing? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who manages everything?” They will say, “Allah.” Then, (you) say, “Would you not, then, fear Allah (by desisting from holding others as gods)?”",
    "So, that is Allah, your Lord in truth. And what is there after truth but error? To where, then, are you being diverted (by your whims)?",
    "This is how the Word of your Lord has come true about the sinners that they will not believe.",
    "Say, “Is there any one from your ‘associate-gods’ who originates the creation, then brings it again? To where then, are you being turned away (by your desires)?”",
    "Say, “Is there any one from your associate-gods who guides to the truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is, then, He who guides to the truth more worthy of being obeyed, or he who has no guidance at all unless he is guided (by someone else)? So, what has happened to you? How do you judge things?",
    "Most of them follow nothing but conjectures. Surely, conjectures are of no avail in the matter of truth at all. Certainly, Allah is fully aware of what they do.",
    "And this Qur’ān is not such as could have been made up by someone without (having been revealed by) Allah, but it is a confirmation of that (discourse) which had been (revealed) before it, and an elaboration of what is prescribed. There is no doubt in it. It is from the Lord of all the worlds.",
    "Or, do they say that he has made it up? Say, “Then, bring a Sūrah like this, and call whomsoever you can beside Allah, if you are true.”",
    "But they have rejected a thing they could not comprehend with knowledge, while its ultimate end has not appeared to them as yet. Similarly those who passed before them had rejected the truth. So, look how was the fate of the unjust.",
    "And among them there are those who believe in it, and among them there are others who do not believe in it. And your Lord has the best knowledge about the mischief-makers.",
    "And if they give the lie to you, say, “For me, my deed, and for you, your deed. You are not accountable for what I do, and I am not accountable for what you do.”",
    "And among them there are those who listen to you. Would you, then, make the deaf hear, even though they lack understanding?",
    "And among them there are those who look at you. Would you, then, guide the blind even when they have no insight?",
    "Surely, Allah does not wrong people at all, but the people do wrong their own selves.",
    "The Day when He will gather them (in the next life,) they will feel as if they had not stayed (in the world) any longer than a fraction of a day. They will recognize each other. Losers, indeed, are those who deny that they will ever face Allah; they are not on the right path.",
    "No matter whether We show you (during your life) some of what We warn them of, or We take you back to Us (before it), in any case, they have to return to Us. Then, Allah is witness to what they do.",
    "For every people there is a messenger. So, when their messenger comes, the matter is decided between them with justice, and they are not wronged.",
    "They say, “When will this promise (of punishment to the disbelievers) be fulfilled if you are true?”",
    "Say, “I have no power to bring a harm or a benefit to myself, except what Allah wills. For every people there is an appointed time. When their time comes, they are not able to put it off for a moment, nor are they able to go ahead of it.”",
    "Say, “Just tell me, if His punishment befalls you at night or by day, what (desirable thing) will it have that the sinners are asking it so hurriedly?",
    "Is it only when it befalls you that you will believe in it? (It will be said to you at that time, “Have you believed) now, while you used to demand (in mockery) that it should come sooner?”",
    "Then it will be said to the unjust, “Taste the punishment lasting for ever. You shall not be punished except for what you have been earning.”",
    "They ask you to tell them whether it is true. Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it is true. And you cannot frustrate (Allah’s plan).”",
    "If anyone who did wrong possesses all that is on the earth, he would (agree to) ransom himself with it. And they will conceal their remorse when they will see the punishment. And the matter will be decided between them with justice and they will not be wronged.",
    "Look! To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Look! Allah’s promise is certainly true, but most of them do not know.",
    "He gives life and brings death, and to Him you shall be returned.",
    "O men, there has come to you an advice from your Lord, and a cure for the ailments of your hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers.",
    "Say, “With the grace of Allah and with His mercy (this book has been revealed). So they should rejoice in it. It is much better than that (wealth) which they accumulate.",
    "Say, “Have you ever considered, whatever provision Allah has sent down for your benefit, you have made up lawful and unlawful from it?” Say, “Has Allah permitted you or are you fabricating a lie against Allah?”",
    "What is the assumption of those who fabricate a lie against Allah (about) the Day of Judgment? Indeed Allah is gracious to people, but most of them are not grateful.",
    "In whatever condition you are, and whatever portion of the Qur’ān you recite therein, and whatever work you all do, We are present before you when you are engaged in it. Hidden from your Lord is nothing even to the measure of a particle on the earth or in the heavens. And there is nothing smaller or greater that is not in the clear Book.",
    "Listen, the friends of Allah shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.",
    "-those who have believed and have been fearful of Allah.",
    "For them there is the good news in the worldly life and in the Hereafter: there is no change in the words of Allah.That is the great achievement.",
    "(O Prophet,) what they say should not make you grieve. Surely, all power belongs to Allah. He is All-Hearing, All Knowing.",
    "Listen, to Allah belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And those who invoke associate-gods besides Allah do not follow a reality. They follow nothing but whims and do nothing but make conjectures.",
    "He is the One who made for you the night, so that you may have rest in it, and (made) the day to see. Indeed, there are signs therein for a people who listen.",
    "They say, “Allah has got a son.” Pure is He. He is Self-Sufficient. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. You have no proof for it. Do you allege about Allah what you do not know?",
    "Say: Those who fabricate lies against Allah shall not prosper.",
    "It will be a little enjoyment in this world; thereafter to Us they are bound to return; then We shall make them taste the severe punishment, because they used to disbelieve.",
    "Recite to them the story of (the Prophet) NūH (Noah), when he said to his people, “O my people, if it is hard on you that I stay (with you) and give (you) advice through the signs of Allah, then, in Allah I place my trust. So, be firm in your plan (against me) with (the help of) all your partners, and your plan should not be a cause of concern for you; then carry it out against me and give me no respite.",
    "Still, if you turn away, then, I did not demand any reward from you. My reward is with none except Allah, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit.”",
    "Then they rejected him, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them the successors, and drowned those who gave the lie to Our signs. So look how was the fate of those who were warned.",
    "Then, after him, We sent messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear signs, but they were not to believe in what they had rejected earlier. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors.",
    "Then, after them, We sent Mūsā and Hārūn with Our signs to Pharaoh and his group, but they showed arrogance. And they were surely a guilty people.",
    "So, when Truth came to them from Us, they said, “It is certainly a clear magic.”",
    "Mūsā said, “Do you say (this) about the Truth when it came to you? Is this magic, while the magicians do not achieve success?”",
    "They said, “Have you come to us to turn us away from the way on which we have found our fathers, and so that you both have supremacy on earth? We are not going to believe in you.”",
    "And Pharaoh said, “Bring to me every knowledgeable magician.”",
    "So, when the magicians came, Mūsā said to them, “Cast what you have to cast.”",
    "So, when they had cast, Mūsā said, “All that you have brought is magic. Allah will certainly bring it to naught. Be assured that Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-makers.”",
    "And Allah establishes the truth through His words, even though the guilty ones may dislike it.",
    "Then, except some youths of his people, no one believed in Mūsā for the fear of Pharaoh and his group, lest he should persecute them. Pharaoh was high-handed in the land and he was of those who crossed all limits.",
    "And Mūsā said, “My people, if you have believed in Allah, then, in Him place your trust if you are obedient.”",
    "So, they said, “In Allah we have placed our trust: Our Lord, do not make us a victim of the unjust people,",
    "and save us, through Your mercy, from the disbelieving people.”",
    "And We revealed to Mūsā and his brother: “Have houses for your people in Egypt, and make your houses worship oriented, and establish Salāh, and give good tidings to the believers.”",
    "Mūsā said, “Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his group glamour and riches in the worldly life, so that, our Lord, they mislead (people) from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their riches and harden their hearts, so that they may not come to believe until they witness the painful punishment.”",
    "Allah said, “The prayer of the two of you has been granted; so stand firm, and never follow the way of the ignorant.”",
    "And We let the children of Isrā’īl cross the sea. So, Pharaoh and his troops chased them in transgression and hostility, until when he was about to drown, he said, “I believe that there is no god but the One in whom the children of Isrā’īl believe, and I am among those who submit to Allah.”",
    "(Allah said,) “Is it now (that you have come to believe) while you were rebellious all along, and you were among the mischief-makers?",
    "So, today, We shall save your body, so that you may become a sign for those after you. And many of the people are heedless of Our signs.”",
    "And surely We gave the children of Isrā’īl a proper place to live, and provided them with good things. Then they did not disagree between themselves but after knowledge had come to them. Surely, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Judgment about the matters in which they used to dispute each other.",
    "So, (O prophet,) even if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book (revealed) before you. Surely, truth has come to you from your Lord, so never be among those who are suspicious.",
    "And never be among those who have rejected Our signs, lest you should be among the losers.",
    "Surely, those against whom the Word of your Lord stands settled will not believe,",
    "even though every sign comes to them, unless they witness the painful punishment.",
    "So, how is it that there never was a town, which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it, except the people of Yūnus? When they came to believe, We removed from them the punishment of humiliation in the worldly life and let them enjoy themselves for some time.",
    "Had your Lord willed, all those on earth would have believed altogether. Would you, then, compel people, so that they become believers?",
    "It is not (possible) for any one that he believes except with the will of Allah. And He makes filth settle on those who do not understand.",
    "Say, “Look at what is there in the heavens and the earth.” But, signs and warnings do not suffice a people who do not believe.",
    "So, are they waiting for nothing short of something like the days of those who have passed before them? Say, “So wait. I am with you, among those who are waiting.”",
    "Then We (used to) save Our messengers and those who believed. Similarly, it being undertaken by Us, We shall save the believers.",
    "Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about my Faith, then, I do not worship those whom you worship beside Allah. Rather, I worship Allah who brings death to you. And I have been ordained to be among the believers,",
    "and that I should make myself firm on Faith, being upright, and never should be among the Mushriks (who ascribe partners to Allah).”",
    "And do not invoke, other than Allah, what neither benefits you nor harms you, for, if you do so, then you will surely be one of the unjust.",
    "If Allah brings some harm to you, there is none to remove it except He. And if He intends to bring some good to you, there is none to turn His grace back. He brings it to whomever He wills from among His servants. He is the Most-Forgiving, the Very Merciful.",
    "Say, “O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So, whoever accepts guidance accepts it to his own benefit, and whoever goes astray does so to his own detriment. And I am not responsible for you.”",
    "Follow what is being revealed to you, and be patient until Allah gives His judgment, and He is the best of all judges.",
    "Alif , Lām , Rā . (This is) a book the verses of which have been made firm, and elaborated by the One who is All Wise, All Aware,",
    "(directing the Prophet to say to the people,) “You must not worship anyone other than Allah; I am for you a warner from Him, and a bearer of glad tidings;",
    "and you must seek forgiveness from your Lord, then, turn to Him in repentance, and He will provide you with good things to enjoy for a given time, and bestow His extra favor on everyone who has extra good deeds (in his account). And if you turn away, then, I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day.",
    "To Allah is your return, and He is powerful over everything.”",
    "Beware, they bend their chests to hide from Him. Beware, when they cover up themselves with their clothes, He knows what they hide and what they expose. Surely, He is All Aware of what lies in the hearts."
