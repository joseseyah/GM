    "’ By the galloping, panting horses,",
    "striking sparks of fire ˹with their hoofs˺,",
    "launching raids at dawn,",
    "stirring up ˹clouds of˺ dust,",
    "and penetrating into the heart of enemy lines!",
    "Surely humankind is ungrateful to their Lord—",
    "and they certainly attest to this—",
    "and they are truly extreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains.",
    "Do they not know that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out,",
    "and the secrets of the hearts will be laid bare—",
    "surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day."
