    "but if any of you is obedient to God and His Messenger and does good deeds, know that We shall give her a double reward and have prepared a generous provision for her.",
    "Wives of the Prophet, you are not like any other woman. If you are truly mindful of God, do not speak too softly in case the sick at heart should lust after you, but speak in an appropriate manner;",
    "stay at home, and do not flaunt your finery as they used to in the pagan past; keep up the prayer, give the prescribed alms, and obey God and His Messenger. God wishes to keep uncleanness away from you, people of the [Prophet’s] House, and to purify you thoroughly.",
    "Remember what is recited in your houses of God’s revelations and wisdom, for God is all subtle, all aware.",
    "For men and women who are devoted to God- believing men and women, obedient men and women, truthful men and women, steadfast men and women, humble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and women, chaste men and women, men and women who remember God often- God has prepared forgiveness and a rich reward.",
    "When God and His Messenger have decided on a matter that concerns them, it is not fitting for any believing man or woman to claim freedom of choice in that matter: whoever disobeys God and His Messenger is far astray.",
    "When you [Prophet] said to the man who had been favoured by God and by you, ‘Keep your wife and be mindful of God,’ you hid in your heart what God would later reveal: you were afraid of people, but it is more fitting that you fear God. When Zayd no longer wanted her, We gave her to you in marriage so that there might be no fault in believers marrying the wives of their adopted sons after they no longer wanted them. God’s command must be carried out:",
    "the Prophet is not at fault for what God has ordained for him. This was God’s practice with those who went before- God’s command must be fulfilled-",
    "[and with all] those who deliver God’s messages and fear only Him and no other: God’s reckoning is enough.",
    "Muhammad is not the father of any one of you men; he is God’s Messenger and the seal of the prophets: God knows everything.",
    "Believers, remember God often",
    "and glorify Him morning and evening:",
    "it is He who blesses you, as do His angels, in order to lead you out of the depths of darkness into the light. He is ever merciful towards the believers-",
    "when they meet Him they will be greeted with ‘Peace’- and He has prepared a generous reward for them.",
    "Prophet, We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and warning,",
    "as one who calls people to God by His leave, as a light-giving lamp.",
    "Give the believers the good news that great bounty awaits them from God.",
    "Do not give in to the disbelievers and the hypocrites: ignore the harm they cause you and put your trust in God. God is enough to trust.",
    "Believers, you have no right to expect a waiting period when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them: make provision for them and release them in an honourable way.",
    "Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war, and the daughters of your uncles and aunts on your father’s and mother’s sides, who migrated with you. Also any believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet wishes to wed- this is only for you [Prophet] and not the rest of the believers: We know exactly what We have made obligatory for them concerning their wives and slave-girls- so you should not be blamed: God is most forgiving, most merciful.",
    "You may make any of [your women] wait and receive any of them as you wish, but you will not be at fault if you invite one whose turn you have previously set aside: this way it is more likely that they will be satisfied and will not be distressed and will all be content with what you have given them. God knows what is in your hearts: God is all knowing, forbearing.",
    "You [Prophet] are not permitted to take any further wives, nor to exchange the wives you have for others, even if these attract you with their beauty. But this does not apply to your slave-girls: God is watchful over all.",
    "Believers, do not enter the Prophet’s apartments for a meal unless you are given permission to do so; do not linger until [a meal] is ready. When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God’s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God’s eyes.",
    "God has full knowledge of all things, whether you reveal them or not.",
    "The Prophet’s wives are not to blame [if they are seen by] their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their women, or their slaves. [Wives of the Prophet], be mindful of God. God observes everything.",
    "God and His angels bless the Prophet- so, you who believe, bless him too and give him greetings of peace.",
    "Those who insult God and His Messenger will be rejected by God in this world and the next- He has prepared a humiliating torment for them-",
    "and those who undeservedly insult believing men and women will bear the guilt of slander and flagrant sin.",
    "Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and women believers to make their outer garments hang low over them so as to be recog-nized and not insulted: God is most forgiving, most merciful.",
    "If the hypocrites, the sick at heart, and those who spread lies in the city do not desist, We shall rouse you [Prophet] against them, and then they will only be your neighbours in this city for a short while.",
    "They will be rejected. Wherever they are found, they will be arrested and put to death.",
    "This has been God’s practice with those who went before. You will find no change in God’s practices.",
    "People ask you about the Hour. Say, ‘God alone has knowledge of it.’ How could you [Prophet] know? The Hour may well be near.",
    "God has rejected the disbelievers and prepared a blazing fire for them.",
    "There they will stay permanently, with no one to befriend or support them.",
    "On the Day when their faces are being turned about in the Fire, they will say, ‘If only we had obeyed God and the Messenger,’",
    "and ‘Lord! We obeyed our masters and our chiefs, and they led us astray.",
    "Lord! Give them a double punishment and reject them completely.’",
    "Believers, do not be like those who insulted Moses- God cleared him of their allegations and he was highly honoured in God’s eyes.",
    "Believers, be mindful of God, speak in a direct fashion and to good purpose,",
    "and He will put your deeds right for you and forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger will truly achieve a great triumph.",
    "We offered the Trust to the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, yet they refused to undertake it and were afraid of it; mankind undertook it- they have always been inept and foolish.",
    "God will punish the hypocrites and the idolaters, both men and women, and turn with mercy to the believers, both men and women: God is most forgiving, most merciful.",
    "Praise be to God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth, and praise be to Him in the life to come. He is the All Wise, the All Aware.",
    "He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it; He knows all that comes down from the heavens and all that goes up to them. He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.",
    "Still, the disbelievers say, ‘The Last Hour will never come upon us.’ Say, ‘Yes, by my Lord, [it will], by Him who knows the unseen! Not even the weight of a speck of dust in the heavens or earth escapes His knowledge, nor anything smaller or greater. It is all recorded in a clear Record",
    "so that He can reward those who believe and do good deeds: they will have forgiveness and generous provision.’",
    "But as for those who work against Our Revelations, seeking to undermine them, there will be a torment of painful suffering.",
    "[Prophet], those who have been given knowledge can see that what has been sent to you from your Lord is the truth, and that it leads to the path of the Almighty, worthy of all praise.",
    "But the disbelievers say, ‘Shall we show you a man who claims that, when you have been utterly torn to pieces, you will be raised in a new creation?",
    "Has he invented a lie about God? Is he mad?’ No! It is those who do not believe in the life to come who will suffer torment, for they are in gross error.",
    "Do they not think about what is in front of them and behind them in the heavens and earth? If We wished, We could make the earth swallow them, or make fragments from the heavens fall down upon them. There truly is a sign in this for every servant who turns back to God in repentance.",
    "We graced David with Our favour. We said, ‘You mountains, echo God’s praises together with him, and you birds, too.’ We softened iron for him,",
    "saying, ‘Make coats of chain mail and measure the links well.’ ‘Do good, all of you, for I see everything you do.’",
    "And [We subjected] the wind for Solomon. Its outward journey took a month, and its return journey likewise. We made a fountain of molten brass flow for him, and some of the jinn worked under his control with his Lord’s permission. If one of them deviated from Our command, We let him taste the suffering of the blazing flame.",
    "They made him whatever he wanted- palaces, statues, basins as large as water troughs, fixed cauldrons. We said, ‘Work thankfully, family of David, for few of my servants are truly thankful.’",
    "Then, when We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing showed the jinn he was dead, but a creature of the earth eating at his stick: when he fell down they realized- if they had known what was hidden they would not have continued their demeaning labour.",
    "There was a sign for the people of Sheba, too, in their dwelling place: two gardens, one on the right, one on the left: ‘Eat from what your Lord has provided for you and give Him thanks, for your land is good, and your Lord most forgiving.’",
    "But they paid no heed, so We let loose on them a flood from the dam and replaced their two gardens with others that yielded bitter fruit, tamarisk bushes, and a few lote trees.",
    "In this way We punished them for their ingratitude- would We punish anyone but the ungrateful?",
    "Also, We had placed, between them and the towns We had blessed, other towns within sight of one another to which they could travel easily- ‘ Travel safely in this land by night and by day’-",
    "but [still] they complained, ‘Our Lord has made the distance between our staging posts so long!’They wronged themselves and, in the end, We made their fate a byword, and scattered them in countless fragments. There truly are signs in this for every patient, thankful person.",
    "Satan was proved right in his opinion of them, for they all followed him- except for a group of believers-",
    "even though he had no authority over them. But [We aim] to distinguish those who believe in the life to come from those who doubt it: [Prophet], your Lord observes everything.",
    "Say, ‘Pray to your so-called gods besides God: they do not control even the weight of a speck of dust in heaven or earth, nor do they have any share in them, nor are any of them any help to God.",
    "Intercession will not work with Him, except by those to whom He gives permission.’ They will be asked, after the terror is lifted from their hearts [on the Day of Judgement], ‘What did your Lord speak?’ and they will answer, ‘The Truth. He is the Most High, the Most Great.’",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and earth?’ Say, ‘God does,’ and ‘[One party of us] must be rightly guided and the other clearly astray.’",
    "Say, ‘You will not be ques-tioned about our sins, nor will we be questioned about what you do.’",
    "Say, ‘Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge justly between us; He alone is the All Knowing Judge.’",
    "Say, ‘Show me those you joined to Him as partners. No indeed! He alone is God, the Almighty, the All Wise.’",
    "We have sent you [Prophet] only to bring good news and warning to all people, but most of them do not understand.",
    "And they say, ‘If what you say is true, when will this promise be fulfilled?’",
    "Say, ‘You have an appointment for a Day which you cannot put off nor bring forward, even by a single moment.’",
    "The disbelievers say, ‘We will believe neither this Qur an nor the Scriptures that came before it.’ If only you could see [Prophet] how the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, hurling reproaches at one another. Those who were oppressed will say to the oppressors, ‘If it were not for you, we would have been believers.’",
    "The oppressors will say to them, ‘Was it we who prevented you from following right guidance after it had reached you? No! You yourselves were sinners.’",
    "The oppressed will say to them, ‘No, it was your scheming, night and day, ordering us to disbelieve in God and set up rivals to Him.’ When they see the punishment, they will fall silent with regret, and We shall put iron collars on the disbelievers’ necks. Why should they be rewarded for anything other than what they have done?",
    "Never have We sent a warner to a community without those among them who were corrupted by wealth saying, ‘We do not believe in the message you have been sent with.’",
    "They would say, ‘We have greater wealth and more children than you, and we shall not be punished.’",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘My Lord gives in abundance to whoever He will and sparingly to whoever He will, though most people do not understand.",
    "Neither wealth nor children will bring you nearer to Us, but those who believe and do good deeds will have multiple rewards for what they have done, and will live safely in the lofty dwellings of Paradise,",
    "whereas those who work against Our messages, seeking to undermine them, will be summoned to punishment.’",
    "Say, ‘My Lord gives in abundance to whichever of His servants He will, and sparingly to whichever He will; He will replace whatever you give in alms; He is the best of providers.’",
    "On the Day He gathers them all together, He will say to the angels, ‘Was it you these people worshipped?’",
    "They will reply, ‘May You be exalted! You are our supporter against them! Really, they worshipped the jinn- most of them believed in them.’",
    "‘So today neither of you has any power to benefit or harm the other,’ We shall tell the evildoers, ‘Taste the torment of the fire which you called a lie.’",
    "When Our messages are recited to them, clear as they are, they say, ‘This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers worshipped,’ and, ‘This [Quran] is nothing but lies he has made up.’ When the Truth comes to the disbelievers, they say, ‘This is just plain sorcery,’",
    "though We have not given them any books to study nor sent any warner before you.",
    "Those who lived before them also denied the truth- these people have not attained even a tenth of what We gave their predecessors- they, too, rejected My messengers, and how terrible My condemnation was!",
    "Say [Prophet], ‘I advise you to do one thing only: stand before God, in pairs or singly, and think: there is no sign of madness in your companion [the Prophet]- he is only warning you before severe suffering arrives.’",
    "Say, ‘If I have asked you for any reward, you can keep it. It is God alone who will reward me: He is witness to everything.’",
    "Say, ‘My Lord hurls the Truth down [before you]. He has full knowledge of all that is unseen.’",
    "Say, ‘The Truth has come; falsehood is powerless.’",
    "Say, ‘If I go astray, that is my loss, and if I am rightly guided, it is through what my Lord has revealed to me. He is all hearing, and ever near.’",
    "[Prophet], if you could only see their terror! There will be no escape when they are seized from a nearby place;",
    "they will say, ‘Now we believe in it,’ but how can they reach it from such a distant place-",
    "they denied it all in the past, and threw conjecture from a faroff place-",
    "when a barrier has been placed between them and what they desire, just as was done with their kind before? They were deep in doubt and suspicion.",
    "Praise be to God, Creator of the heavens and earth, who made angels messengers with two, three, four [pairs of] wings. He adds to creation as He will: God has power over everything.",
    "No one can withhold the blessing God opens up for people, nor can anyone but Him release whatever He withholds: He is the Almighty, the All Wise.",
    "People, remember God’s grace towards you. Is there any creator other than God to give you sustenance from the heavens and earth? There is no god but Him. How can you be so deluded?",
    "If they call you a liar [Prophet], many messengers before you were also called liars: it is to God that all things will be returned.",
    "People! God’s promise is true, so do not let the present life deceive you. Do not let the Deceiver deceive you about God:",
    "Satan is your enemy––so treat him as an enemy––and invites his followers only to enter the blazing fire.",
    "Those who disbelieve will be punished severely; those who believe and do good deeds will be forgiven, and richly rewarded.",
    "What about those whose evil deeds are made alluring to them so that they think they are good? God leaves whoever He will to stray and guides whoever He will. [Prophet], do not waste your soul away with regret for them: God knows exactly what they do.",
    "It is God who sends forth the winds; they raise up the clouds; We drive them to a dead land and with them revive the earth after its death: such will be the Resurrection.",
    "If anyone desires power, all power belongs to God; good words rise up to Him and He lifts up the righteous deed, but a severe torment awaits those who plot evil and their plotting will come to nothing.",
    "It is God who created you from dust and later from a drop of fluid; then He made you into two sexes; no female conceives or gives birth without His knowledge; no person grows old or has his life cut short, except in accordance with a Record: all this is easy for God.",
    "The two bodies of water are not alike- one is palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, the other salty and bitter- yet from each you eat fresh fish and extract ornaments to wear, and in each you see the ships ploughing their course so that you may seek God’s bounty and be grateful.",
    "He makes the night merge into the day and the day into the night; He has subjected the sun and the moon- each runs for an appointed term. Such is God your Lord: all control belongs to Him. Those you invoke beside Him do not even control the skin of a date stone;",
    "if you call them they cannot hear you; if they could hear, they could not answer you; on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your idolatry. None can inform you [Prophet] like the One who is all aware.",
    "People, it is you who stand in need of God- God needs nothing and is worthy of all praise-",
    "if He wills, He can do away with you and bring in a new creation,",
    "that is not difficult for God.",
    "No burdened soul will bear the burden of another: even if a heavily laden soul should cry for help, none of its load will be carried, not even by a close relative. But you [Prophet] can only warn those who fear their Lord, though they cannot see Him, and keep up the prayer- whoever purifies himself does so for his own benefit–– everything returns to God.",
    "The blind and the seeing are not alike,",
    "nor are darkness and light;",
    "shade and heat are not alike,",
    "nor are the living and the dead. God makes anyone He wills hear [His message]: you cannot make those in their graves hear.",
    "You are only here to warn them-",
    "We have sent you with the Truth as a bearer of good news and warning- every community has been sent a warner.",
    "If they call you a liar, their predecessors did the same: messengers came to them with clear signs, scriptures, and enlightening revelation",
    "and afterwards I seized the disbelievers- how terrible My punishment was!",
    "Have you [Prophet] not considered how God sends water down from the sky and that We produce with it fruits of varied colours; that there are in the mountains layers of white and red of various hues, and jet black;",
    "that there are various colours among human beings, wild animals, and livestock too? It is those of His servants who have knowledge who stand in true awe of God. God is almighty, most forgiving.",
    "Those who recite God’s scripture, keep up the prayer, give secretly and openly from what We have provided for them, may hope for a trade that will never decline:",
    "He will repay them in full, and give them extra from His bounty. He is most forgiving, most appreciative.",
    "The Scripture We have revealed to you [Prophet] is the Truth and confirms the scriptures that preceded it. God is well informed about His servants, He sees everything.",
    "We gave the Scripture as a heritage to Our chosen servants: some of them wronged their own souls, some stayed between [right and wrong], and some, by God’s leave, were foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favour:",
    "they will enter lasting Gardens where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, where they will wear silk garments.",
    "They will say, ‘Praise be to God, who has separated us from all sorrow! Our Lord is truly most forgiving, most appreciative:",
    "He has, in His bounty, settled us in the everlasting Home where no toil or fatigue will touch us.’",
    "But those who reject the truth will stay in Hellfire, where they will neither be finished off by death, nor be relieved from Hell’s torment: this is how We reward hardened disbelievers.",
    "They will cry out loud in Hell, ‘Lord, let us out, and we will do righteous deeds, not what we did before!’- ‘ Did We not give you a life long enough to take warning if you were going to? The warner came to you, now taste the punishment.’ The evildoers will have nobody to help them.",
    "God knows all that is hidden in the heavens and earth; He knows the thoughts contained in the heart;",
    "it is He who made you [people] successors to the land. Those who deny the truth will bear the consequences: their denial will only make them more odious to their Lord, and add only to their loss.",
    "Say, ‘Consider those “partners” of yours that you call upon beside God. Show me! What part of the earth did they create? What share of the heavens do they possess?’ Have We given them a book that contains clear evidence? No indeed! The idolaters promise each other only delusion.",
    "God keeps the heavens and earth from vanishing; if they did vanish, no one else could stop them. God is most forbearing, most forgiving.",
    "[The idolaters] swore their most solemn oath that, if someone came to warn them, they would be more rightly guided than any [other] community, but when someone did come they turned yet further away,",
    "became more arrogant in the land, and intensified their plotting of evil- the plotting of evil only rebounds on those who plot. Do they expect anything but what happened to earlier people? You will never find any change in God’s practice; you will never find any deviation there.",
    "Have they not travelled in the land and seen how those before them met their end, although they were superior to them in strength? God is not to be frustrated by anything in the heavens or on the earth: He is all knowing, all powerful.",
    "If God were to punish people [at once] for the wrong they have done, there would not be a single creature left on the surface of the earth. He gives them respite for a stated time and, whenever their time comes, God has been watching His servants.",
    "Ya Sin",
    "By the wise Quran,",
    "you [Muhammad] are truly one of the mes-sengers sent",
    "on a straight path,",
    "with a revelation from the Almighty, the Lord of Mercy,",
    "to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, and so they are unaware.",
    "The verdict has been passed against most of them, for they refuse to believe.",
    "[It is as if] We had placed [iron] collars around their necks, right up to their chins so that their heads are forced up",
    "and set barriers before and behind them, blocking their vision: they cannot see.",
    "It is all the same to them whether you warn them or not: they will not believe.",
    "You can warn only those who will follow the Quran and hold the Merciful One in awe, though they cannot see Him: give such people the glad news of forgiveness and a noble reward.",
    "We shall certainly bring the dead back to life, and We record what they send ahead of them as well as what they leave behind: We keep an account of everything in a clear Record.",
    "Give them the example of the people to whose town messengers came.",
    "We sent two messengers but they rejected both. Then We reinforced them with a third. They said, ‘Truly, we are messengers to you,’",
    "but they answered, ‘You are only men like ourselves. The Lord of Mercy has sent nothing; you are just lying.'",
    "They said, ‘Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you.",
    "Our duty is only to deliver the message to you,’",
    "but they answered, ‘We think you are an evil omen. If you do not stop, we shall stone you, and inflict a painful torment on you.’",
    "The messengers said, ‘The evil omen is within yourselves. Why do you take it as an evil omen when you are reminded of the Truth? You are going too far!’",
    "Then, from the furthest part of the city, a man came running. He said, ‘My people, follow the messengers.",
    "Follow them: they are not asking you to reward them and they are rightly guided."
