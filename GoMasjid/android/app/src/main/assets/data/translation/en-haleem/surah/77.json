    "By the [winds] sent forth in swift succession,",
    "violently storming,",
    "scattering far and wide,",
    "separating forcefully,",
    "delivering a reminder,",
    "as a proof or a warning:",
    "what you are promised will come to pass.",
    "When the stars are dimmed",
    "and the sky is torn apart,",
    "when the mountains are turned to dust",
    "and the messengers given their appointed time––",
    "for what Day has all this been set?",
    "The Day of Decision.",
    "What will explain to you what the Day of Decision is?",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "Did We not destroy the first [of them]?",
    "We shall make the last follow them:",
    "this is how We deal with the guilty.",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "Did We not make you from an underrated fluid",
    "which We housed in a safe lodging",
    "for a determined period?",
    "We determine [it]: how excellently We determine!",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "Did We not make the earth a home",
    "for the living and the dead?",
    "Did We not place firm, lofty mountains on it and provide you with sweet water?",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "They will be told, ‘Go to that which you used to deny!",
    "Go to a shadow of smoke!’ It rises in three columns;",
    "no shade does it give, nor relief from the flame;",
    "it shoots out sparks as large as treetrunks",
    "and as bright as copper.",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "On that Day they will be speechless,",
    "and they will be given no chance to offer any excuses.",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "[They will be told], ‘This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and earlier generations.",
    "If you have any plots against Me, try them now.’",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "But those who took heed of God will enjoy cool shade, springs,",
    "and any fruit they desire;",
    "[they will be told], ‘Eat and drink to your hearts’ content as a reward for your deeds:",
    "this is how We reward those who do good.’",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "[You may] eat and enjoy yourselves for a short while, evildoers that you are.",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "When they are told, ‘Bow down in prayer,’ they do not do so.",
    "Woe, on that Day, to those who denied the truth!",
    "In what revelation, after this, will they believe?"
