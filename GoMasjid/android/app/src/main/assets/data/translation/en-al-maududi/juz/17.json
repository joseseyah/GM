    "The time of people's reckoning has drawn near, and yet they turn aside in heedlessness.",
    "Whenever any fresh admonition comes to them from their Lord they barely heed it and remain immersed in play,",
    "their hearts being set on other concerns. The wrong-doers whisper to one another: \"This person is no more than a mortal like yourselves. Will you, then, be enchanted by sorcery while you see?\"",
    "He said: \"My Lord knows well all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth. He is All-Hearing, All- Knowing.\"",
    "They say: \"Nay, these are confused dreams; nay, he has forged it; nay, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign, even as the Messengers of the past were sent with signs.\"",
    "Not one township that We destroyed before them believed. Would they, then, believe?",
    "(O Muhammad), even before you We never sent any other than human beings as Messengers, and to them We sent revelation. Ask the People of the Book if you do not know.",
    "We did not endow the Messengers with bodies that would need no food; nor were they immortals.",
    "Then We fulfilled the promise We had made to them: We rescued them and those whom We wished, and We destroyed those who exceeded all bounds.",
    "We have bestowed upon you a Book that mentions you. Do you not understand?",
    "How many a wrong-doing town did We shatter and then raise up another people.",
    "Then, when they perceived Our chastisement they took to their heels and fled.",
    "(They were told): \"Flee not, but return to your comforts and to your dwellings. You are likely to be questioned.\"",
    "They said: \"Woe to us; surely we were wrong-doers.\"",
    "They did not cease to cry this until We reduced them to stubble, still and silent.",
    "We did not create in sport the heavens and the earth and all that lies between the two.",
    "Had it been Our will to find a pastime, We would have found one near at hand; if at all We were inclined to do so.",
    "Nay, We hurl the Truth at falsehood so that the Truth crushes falsehood, and lo! it vanishes. Woe to you for what you utter!",
    "To Him belongs whosoever dwells in the heavens and on earth. Those (angels) that are with Him neither disdain to serve Him out of pride, nor do they weary of it.",
    "They glorify Him night and day, without flagging.",
    "Have they taken earthly gods who are such that they raise up the dead to life?",
    "Had there been any gods in the heavens and the earth apart from Allah, the order of both the heavens and the earth would have gone to ruins. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne, Who is far above their false descriptions of Him.",
    "None shall question Him about what He does, but they shall be questioned.",
    "Have they taken gods other than Him? Say, (O Muhammad): \"Bring forth your proof! Here is the Book with admonition for those of my time and there are also scriptures with admonition for people before me.\" But most people do not know the Truth, and have, therefore, turned away from it.",
    "Never did We send any Messenger before you to whom We did not reveal: \"There is no god but Me. So serve Me alone.\"",
    "They say: \"The Most Compassionate Lord has taken to Himself a son.\" Glory be to Him! Those whom they so designate are only His honoured servants.",
    "They do not outstrip Him in speech and only act as He commands.",
    "He knows whatever is before them and whatsoever is remote from them and they do not intercede except for him, intercession on whose behalf pleases Him, and they stand constantly in awe of Him.",
    "And if anyone of them were to claim: \"Indeed I am a god apart from Him,\" We shall recompense both with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrong-doers.",
    "Did the unbelievers (who do not accept the teaching of the Prophet) not realize that the heavens and the earth were one solid mass, then We tore them apart, and We made every living being out of water? Will they, then, not believe (that We created all this)?",
    "And We placed firm mountains on earth lest it should sway with them, and We made wide paths in them that they may find their way;",
    "and We made the sky a secure canopy; and yet they turn away from these Signs.",
    "It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each of them is floating in its orbit.",
    "(O Muhammad), We did not grant everlasting life to any human being even before you. If you were to die, will they live for ever?",
    "Every living being shall taste death and We shall subject you to ill and good by way of trial, and to Us shall all of you be eventually sent back.",
    "When the unbelievers see you they make you an object of fun, saying: \"Is he the one who mentions your gods?\" They say so, and yet they reject with disdain the very mention of the Most Compassionate Lord.",
    "Man is hasty by nature. I shall certainly show you My Signs. Do not ask Me to be hasty.",
    "They say: \"(Tell us) when will the threat of punishment come to pass if you are truthful?\"",
    "If only the unbelievers knew of the Hour when they shall not be able to keep off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs; nor shall they be helped.",
    "That will suddenly come upon them and stupefy them. They shall not be able to ward it off, nor shall they be granted any respite.",
    "Other Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who scoffed at the Messengers were overtaken by the same scourge that they had scoffed at.",
    "Tell them, (O Muhammad): \"Who protects you, during the night or the day from the Most Compassionate Lord?\" And yet they turn away from the Admonition of their Lord.",
    "Do they have any gods who would protect them against Us? They have no power even to help themselves; nor do they enjoy Our support.",
    "Nay, We generously provided them and their fathers, and they enjoyed Our provision for long. Do they not see that We are now advancing into their territory, diminishing it from different sides? Is it they, then, who will triumph?\"",
    "Tell them: \"I only warn you by the Revelation.\" But the deaf do not hear the cry when they are warned.",
    "Were only the slightest whiff from your Lord's punishment to touch them, they would cry out: \"Woe to us; we were indeed wrong-doers.\"",
    "We shall set up just scales on the Day of Resurrection so that none will be wronged in the least. (We shall bring forth the acts of everyone), even if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed. We shall suffice as Reckoners.",
    "Surely We had granted to Moses and Aaron the Criterion (between right and wrong), and Light and Admonition for the good of the God-fearing,",
    "for those who fear their Lord without seeing Him and dread the Hour (of Reckoning).",
    "This is a Blessed Admonition that We have revealed. Are you, then, going to reject it?",
    "Surely We had bestowed wisdom upon Abraham even earlier, and We knew him well.",
    "Recall, when he said to his father and his people: \"What are these images to which you are devoutly clinging?\"",
    "They answered: \"We found our fathers worshipping them.\"",
    "He said: \"Certainly you and your fathers have all been in manifest error.\"",
    "They said: \"Are you expressing your true ideas before us or are you jesting?\"",
    "He said: \"Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth which He created and to that I bear witness before you.",
    "By Allah, I shall certainly carry out my plan against your gods after you are gone.\"",
    "Then he broke them all into pieces, sparing only the supreme one among them that they may possibly return to him.",
    "(When they saw the idols in this state) they said: \"Who has done this to our gods? Surely he is one of the wrong-doers.\"",
    "Some of them said: \"We heard a youth called Abraham speak (ill) of them.\"",
    "The others said: \"Bring him, then, before the eyes of the people that they may see (what will be done to him).\"",
    "(On Abraham's arrival) they said: \"Abraham, are you he who has done this to our gods?\"",
    "He answered: \"Rather it was this supreme one who has done it. So ask them, if they can speak.\"",
    "Thereupon they turned to their (inner) selves and said (to themselves): \"Surely it is you who are the wrong-doers.\"",
    "Then their minds were turned upside down, and they said: \"You know well that they do not speak.\"",
    "Abraham said: \"Do you, then, worship beside Allah a thing that can neither benefit you nor hurt you?",
    "Fie upon you and upon all that you worship beside Allah. Do you have no sense?\"",
    "They said: \"Burn him, and come to the support of your gods, if you are going to do anything.\"",
    "We said: \"O fire, become coolness and safety for Abraham.\"",
    "They had sought to do evil to him, but We caused them to be the worst losers,",
    "and We saved him and Lot and brought him to the land upon which We had bestowed Our blessings for all the people of the world.",
    "And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift, making each of them righteous.",
    "And We made them into leaders to guide people in accordance with Our command, and We inspired them to good works, and to establish Prayers and to give Zakah. They worshipped Us alone.",
    "We bestowed upon Lot sound judgement and knowledge, and We delivered him from the city that was immersed in foul deeds. They were indeed a wicked people, exceedingly disobedient.",
    "And We admitted him into Our mercy. Verily he was of the righteous.",
    "We bestowed the same favour upon Noah. Recall, when he cried to Us before; We accepted his prayer and delivered him and his household from the great distress",
    "and We helped him against a people who rejected Our signs as false. They were indeed an evil people and so We drowned them all.",
    "We bestowed the same favour upon David and Solomon. Recall, when they gave judgement regarding a tillage into which the sheep of some people had strayed at night, and We were witnesses to their judgement.",
    "We guided Solomon to the right verdict, and We had granted each of them judgement and knowledge. We made the mountains and the birds celebrate the praise of Allah with David. It was We Who did all this.",
    "It was We Who taught him the art of making coats of mail for your benefit so that it may protect you from each other's violence. Do you, then, give thanks?",
    "And We subdued the strongly raging wind to Solomon which blew at his bidding towards the land We blessed. We know everything.",
    "And We subdued many devils who dived (into the sea) for him and carried out other jobs besides that. We kept watch over all of them.",
    "We bestowed (the same wisdom, judgement and knowledge) upon Job. Recall, when he cried to his Lord: \"Behold, disease has struck me and You are the Most Merciful of those that are merciful.\"",
    "We accepted his prayer and removed the affliction from him, and We not only restored to him his family but as many more with them as a mercy from Us and as a lesson to the worshippers.",
    "And (We bestowed the same favour) upon Ishmael, Idris and Dhu al-Kifl, for they were all steadfast.",
    "And We admitted them into Our mercy, for they were of the righteous.",
    "And We bestowed Our favour upon Dhu al-Nun. Recall, when he went forth enraged, thinking We have no power to take him to task. Eventually he cried out in the darkness:\" There is no god but You. Glory be to You! I have done wrong.\"",
    "Thereupon We accepted his prayer, and rescued him from grief. Thus do We rescue the believers.",
    "And We bestowed favour upon Zechariah, when he cried to his Lord: \"Lord! Leave me not solitary (without any issue). You are the Best Inheritor.\"",
    "So We accepted his prayer and bestowed upon him John, and We made his wife fit (to bear a child). Verily they hastened in doing good works and called upon Us with longing and fear, and humbled themselves to Us.",
    "And also recall the woman who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her and her son a Sign to the whole world.",
    "Verily this community of yours is a single community, and I am your Lord; so worship Me.",
    "But they tore asunder their faith into many parts. But to Us they are bound to return.",
    "Then whosoever does righteous works, while believing, his striving will not go unappreciated. We record them all for him.",
    "It has been ordained against every town that We ever destroyed that they shall not return (to enjoy a new lease of life)",
    "until Gog and Magog are let loose, and begin swooping from every mound,",
    "and the time for the fulfilment of the true promise of Allah draws near, whereupon the eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in fear, and they will say: \"Woe to us, we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we were wrongdoers.\"",
    "(They will be told): \"Verily you and the gods you worshipped beside Allah are the fuel of Hell. All of you are bound to arrive there.",
    "Had these indeed been gods they would not have gone there. But (as it is), all of you shall ever abide in it.\"",
    "There they shall groan with anguish and the din and noise in Hell will not let them hear anything.",
    "But for those whom We had decided to favour with good reward, they shall be kept far removed from Hell.",
    "They shall not hear even a whisper of it, and they shall live for ever in the delights which they had desired.",
    "The Hour of the Great Terror shall not grieve them, and the angels shall receive them saying: \"This is your Day which you had been promised.\"",
    "On that Day We shall roll up the heavens like a scroll for writing. Even as We originated the creation first so We shall repeat it. This is a promise binding on Us; and so We shall do.",
    "Surely We wrote in the Psalms, after the exhortation, that the earth shall be inherited by My righteous servants.",
    "Herein, surely, is a message for those devoted to worship.",
    "We have sent you forth as nothing but mercy to people of the whole world.",
    "Say: \"It is revealed to me that your God is only One God. Will you, then, submit to Him?\"",
    "If they turn away, say to them: \"I have warned you all alike; and I cannot say whether what you have been promised is near or distant.",
    "Indeed He knows what you say loudly and what you hide.",
    "I think that this [reprieve] is possibly a trial for you, an opportunity to enjoy yourselves until an appointed time.\"",
    "The Messenger said: \"My Lord! Judge with truth. Our Compassionate Lord alone is our support against your (blasphemous) utterances.\"",
    "O mankind, fear the (wrath of) your Lord! Indeed, the earthquake of the Hour (of Judgement) will be an awesome thing.",
    "On the Day when you witness it, the suckling woman shall utterly neglect the infant she suckles, and every pregnant woman shall cast her burden, and you will see people as though they are drunk, when they are not drunk; but dreadful shall be Allah's chastisement.",
    "Among people there are some who wrangle about Allah without knowledge and follow every rebellious devil,",
    "although it is decreed about him that he shall lead into error whosoever takes him for a friend, and will direct him to the torment of the Fire.",
    "O mankind! If you have any doubt concerning Resurrection, then know that it is surely We Who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot of blood, then from a little lump of flesh, some of it shapely and other shapeless. (We are rehearsing this) that We may make the reality clear to you. We cause (the drop of sperm) that We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time. We bring you forth as infants (and nurture you) that you may come of age. Among you is he that dies (at a young age) and he who is kept back to the most abject age so that after once having known, he reaches a stage when he knows nothing. You see the earth dry and barren and then no sooner than We send down water upon it, it begins to quiver and swell and brings forth every kind of beauteous vegetation.",
    "All this is because Allah, He is the Truth, and because He resurrects the dead, and because He has power over everything,",
    "(all of which shows that) the Hour shall surely come to pass - in this there is no doubt - and Allah shall surely resurrect those that are in graves.",
    "And among people are those that wrangle about Allah without knowledge, without any true guidance, and without any scripture to enlighten them.",
    "They wrangle arrogantly, intent on leading people astray from the Way of Allah. Such shall suffer disgrace in this world and We shall cause them to taste the chastisement of burning (in the Next).",
    "That is the outcome of what your own hands have wrought, for Allah never wrongs His creatures.",
    "And among people is he who worships Allah on the borderline; if any good befalls him, he is satisfied; but if a trial afflicts him, he utterly turns away. He will incur the loss of this world and the Hereafter. That indeed is a clear loss.",
    "He invokes, instead of Allah, those who can neither harm nor benefit him. That indeed is straying far away.",
    "He invokes those that are more likely to cause him harm than benefit. Such is surely an evil patron, and an evil associate.",
    "(In contrast) Allah will assuredly cause those who believe and act righteously to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow. For, most certainly, Allah does whatever He pleases.",
    "Anyone who fancies that Allah will not support him in this world and in the Hereafter, let him reach out to heaven through a rope, and then make a hole in the sky and see whether his device can avert that which enrages him.",
    "Even so We have revealed the Qur'an with Clear Signs. Verily Allah guides whomsoever He wills.",
    "On the Day of Resurrection Allah will most certainly judge among those who believe, and those who became Jews, and Sabaeans, and Christians, and Magians, and those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity. Surely Allah watches over everything.",
    "Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and all those who are in the earth prostrate themselves before Allah; and so do the sun and the moon, and the stars and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and so do many human beings, and even many of those who are condemned to chastisement? And he whom Allah humiliates, none can give him honour. Allah does whatever He wills.",
    "These two groups (the believers and unbelievers) are in dispute about their Lord. As for those that disbelieve, garments of fire have been cut out for them; boiling water shall be poured down over their heads,",
    "causing (not only) their skins but all that is in their bellies as well to melt away.",
    "There shall be maces of iron to lash them.",
    "Whenever they try, in their anguish, to escape from Hell, they will be driven back into it, (and shall be told): \"Now taste the torment of burning.\"",
    "(On the other hand), Allah will cause those who believed and acted righteously to enter the Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall be decked in them with bracelets of gold and pearls and their raiment shall be of silk.",
    "They were guided (to accept) the pure word; they were guided to the Way of the Praiseworthy (Lord).",
    "Indeed those who disbelieve and who (now) hinder people from the Way of Allah and hinder them from the Holy Mosque which We have set up (as a place of worship) for all people, equally for those who dwell therein and for those who come from outside, (they surely deserve punishment). Whosoever deviates therein from the Right Way and acts with iniquity, We shall cause him to taste a painful chastisement.",
    "Call to mind when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House (Kabah), directing him: \"Do not associate aught with Me\" and \"Keep My House pure for those who walk around it, and for those who stand and who bow down and who prostrate themselves (in worship),",
    "and publicly proclaim Pilgrimage for all mankind so that they come to you on foot and mounted on lean camels from every distant point",
    "to witness the benefits in store for them, and pronounce the name of Allah during the appointed days over the cattle that He has provided them. So eat of it and feed the distressed and the needy.",
    "Thereafter, let them tidy up and fulfil their vows and circumambulate the Ancient House.\"",
    "Such (was the purpose of building the Kabah). Whosoever, then, venerates Allah's sanctities will find it to be good for him in the sight of his Lord. Cattle have been made lawful for you except those mentioned to you (as unlawful). So shun the abomination of idols and shun all words of falsehood.",
    "Become exclusively devoted to Allah, ascribing Divinity to none other than Him. Whoso ascribes Divinity to aught beside Allah, it is as though he fell down from the sky whereafter either the birds will snatch him away, or the wind will sweep him to a distant place (causing him to be shattered to pieces).",
    "Such is the fact. And whoso venerates the sanctity of all that have been ordained as symbols of Allah surely does so because it is part of the true piety of the hearts.",
    "You may derive benefit (from sacrificial animals) until an appointed time. Thereafter their place (of sacrifice) is near the Ancient House.",
    "For every people We have laid down a ritual of sacrifice (- although the purpose of the ritual is the same -) that they pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle He has provided them. Your Lord is One God; so submit yourselves to Him alone. And give, (O Prophet), glad tidings to those that humble themselves (before Allah),",
    "whose hearts shiver whenever Allah is mentioned, who patiently bear whatever affliction comes to them, who establish Prayer, and who spend (for good purposes) out of what We have provided them.",
    "We have appointed sacrificial camels among the symbols of (devotion to) Allah. There is much good in them for you. So make them stand (at the time of sacrifice) and pronounce the name of Allah over them, and when they fall down on their sides(after they are slaughtered), eat and also feed them who do not ask and those who ask. Thus have We subjected these animals that you may give thanks.",
    "Neither their flesh reaches Allah nor their blood; it is your piety that reaches Him. He has subjected these animals (to you) that you may magnify Allah for the guidance He has bestowed upon you. Give glad tidings, (O Prophet), to those who do good.",
    "Surely Allah defends those who believe. Certainly Allah has no love for the perfidious, the thankless.",
    "Permission (to fight) has been granted to those for they have been wronged. Verily Allah has the power to help them:",
    "those who were unjustly expelled from their homes for no other reason than their saying: \"Allah is Our Lord.\" If Allah were not to repel some through others, monasteries and churches and synagogues and mosques wherein the name of Allah is much mentioned, would certainly have been pulled down. Allah will most certainly help those who will help Him. Verily Allah is Immensely Strong, Overwhelmingly Mighty.",
    "(Allah will certainly help) those who, were We to bestow authority on them in the land, will establish Prayers, render Zakah, enjoin good, and forbid evil. The end of all matters rests with Allah.",
    "(O Prophet), if they give the lie to you, then before them the people of 'Ad and Thamud, also gave the lie (to the Prophets),",
    "and so too did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot;",
    "and so did the dwellers of Midian, and Moses too was branded a liar. Initially I granted respite to the unbelievers for a while and then seized them. How dreadful was My punishment!",
    "How many towns have We destroyed because their people were steeped in iniquity: so they lie fallen down upon their turrets! How many wells lie deserted; and how many towering palaces lie in ruins!",
    "Have they not journeyed in the land that their hearts might understand and their ears might listen? For indeed it is not the eyes that are blinded; it is rather the hearts in the breasts that are rendered blind.",
    "They ask you to hasten the punishment. Allah shall most certainly not fail His promise; but a Day with your Lord is as a thousand years of your reckoning.",
    "How many towns did I respite at first though they were steeped in iniquity, and then I seized them! To Me are all destined to return.",
    "Say (O Muhammad): \"O people! I have been sent to you only as a plain warner (before the Doom strikes you).\"",
    "So those who believe and act righteously shall be granted forgiveness and an honourable sustenance,",
    "whereas those who strive against Our Signs, seeking to profane them, they are the friends of the Fire!",
    "Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you (O Muhammad), but that whenever he had a desire, Satan interfered with that desire. Allah eradicates the interference of Satan and strengthens His Signs. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
    "(He does this) in order that He may make the evil caused by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts there is sickness (of hypocrisy), whose hearts are hard (and vitiated). Surely these wrong-doers have gone too far in their dissension.",
    "(He also does this) in order that those endowed with knowledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord and that they may have faith in it and their hearts may humble themselves before Him. Verily Allah always directs those that believe to the Right Way.",
    "The unbelievers will not cease to be in doubt about it until the Hour suddenly comes upon them, or the chastisement of an ominous day overtakes them.",
    "On that Day all sovereignty shall be Allah's and He will judge among them. Then those who believed and acted righteously shall be in Gardens of Bliss.",
    "A humiliating chastisement awaits those who disbelieved and denied Our Signs.",
    "As for those who migrated in the way of Allah, whereafter they were slain, or died, Allah will certainly grant them a goodly provision. Indeed, Allah is the Best of all those who provide.",
    "He will surely admit them to a resort which will please them. Most certainly Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.",
    "That indeed is so, as for him who retaliates in proportion to the excess committed against him, and is thereafter again subjected to transgression, Allah will surely aid him. Verily Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.",
    "So shall it be because it is Allah Who causes the night to emerge out of the day and causes the day to emerge out of the night and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
    "So shall it be because Allah, He is the Truth, and all whom they invoke instead of Him are false. Allah is Most High, All-Great.",
    "Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky whereby the earth turns green? Verily Allah is Subtle, All-Aware.",
    "To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Surely Allah - He alone is Self- Sufficient, Praiseworthy.",
    "Have you not seen how Allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth, and the vessels that sail in the sea by His command, and it is He Who holds back the sky that it may not fall on earth except by His leave? Surely Allah is Most Gentle, Ever Compassionate to people.",
    "And it is He Who has endowed you with life and it is He who causes you to die, and it is He Who will then resurrect you. Man is indeed extremely prone to denying the Truth.",
    "For every people We have prescribed a way of worship which they follow. So, (O Muhammad), let them not dispute with you concerning this, and call them to Your Lord. You are certainly on the Straight Way.",
    "And if they dispute with you, say: \"Allah knows well what you do.",
    "Allah will judge among you on the Day of Resurrection concerning matters about which you disagreed.\"",
    "Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and the earth? Surely it is all preserved in a Book. Indeed that is easy with Allah.",
    "Instead of Allah they worship those concerning whom He has revealed no sanction and concerning whom they have no true knowledge. None shall be able to help such evil-doers.",
    "When Our Signs are plainly recited to them, you will perceive utter repugnance on their faces and it all but seems as if they will soon pounce upon those who recite Our Signs to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you what is worse than that? The Fire with which Allah has threatened those who disbelieve. That is truly an evil end.\"",
    "O people, a parable is set forth: pay heed to it. Those who call upon aught other than Allah shall never be able to create even a fly, even if all of them were to come together to do that. And if the fly were to snatch away anything from them, they would not be able to recover that from it. Powerless is the supplicant; and powerless is he to whom he supplicates.",
    "They have not formed a true estimate of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.",
    "Allah chooses Messengers from among angels and from among human beings (to convey His command). Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.",
    "He knows all that is before them and that which is hidden from them. And it is to Allah that all affairs are returned.",
    "Believers, bow down and prostrate yourselves before Your Lord and serve Your Lord and do good that you may prosper.",
    "Strive in the cause of Allah in a manner worthy of that striving. He has chosen you (for His task), and He has not laid upon you any hardship in religion. Keep to the faith of your father Abraham. Allah named you Muslims earlier and even in this (Book), that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over all mankind. So establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector. What an excellent Protector; what an excellent Helper!"
