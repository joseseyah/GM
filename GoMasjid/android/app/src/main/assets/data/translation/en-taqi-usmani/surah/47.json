    "Those who disbelieved, and prevented (others) from Allah’s way, He (Allah) has rendered their deeds vain.",
    "And those who believed and did righteous deeds and believed in that which is revealed to MuHammad,-and it is the truth (that has come) from their Lord-He will write off their evil deeds, and will set aright their state of affairs.",
    "That is because the disbelievers have followed falsehood, while the believers have followed the truth (that has come) from their Lord. This is how Allah explains their (respective) situations to the people.",
    "So, when you encounter those who disbelieve, then (aim at) smiting the necks, until when you have broken their strength thoroughly, then tie fast the bond, (by making them captives). Then choose (to release them) either (as) a favour (shown to them,), or (after receiving) ransom,until the war throws down its load of arms. That (is Our command.) If Allah willed, He would have (Himself) subjected them to retribution, but (Allah ordered you to fight,) so that He may test some of you through some others. And those who are killed in Allah’s way, He will never let their deeds go to waste.",
    "(Instead,) He will guide them, and will set aright their state of affairs,",
    "and will admit them to the Paradise He has identified for them.",
    "O you who believe, if you will help (the religion prescribed by) Allah, He will help you, and will stabilize your footings.",
    "As for those who disbelieve, (destined) for them is destruction, and He has rendered their deeds vain.",
    "That is because they hate what Allah has sent down; therefore Allah has nullified their deeds.",
    "Have they not travelled in the land so that they might see how was the end of those before them? Allah brought utter destruction to them. And (ready) for (these) disbelievers are the likes thereof.",
    "That is because Allah is the supporter of those who believe. As for the disbelievers, there is no supporter for them.",
    "Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to the gardens beneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they enjoy (the worldly life), and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire is the final abode for them.",
    "How many a town, stronger in might than your town that has expelled you, have We destroyed! Then, there was none to help them.",
    "Then, can one who holds on to a clear proof from his Lord be like those for whom their evil deeds are beautified, and who followed their desires?",
    "(Here is) a description of the Paradise that is promised for the God-fearing! In it there are rivers of water, never spoiling, and rivers of milk the taste of which would not go bad, and rivers of wine, delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of honey, fully purified. And for them there are all sorts of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord. Are they like those who will live in Fire forever, and will be given boiling water to drink, and it will tear their bowels into pieces?",
    "Among them there are ones who (pretend to) give ear to you, until when they go out from your presence, they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What did he say just now?” Those are the ones on whose hearts Allah has put a seal, and they have followed their desires.",
    "As for those who have adopted right path, Allah improves them in guidance, and gives them their piety.",
    "They are waiting for nothing but for the Hour (of Doom) that it should come upon them suddenly. So, its signs have already come. Then, once it will come upon them, how would they have an opportunity to accept the advice (already) given to them?",
    "So, be assured that there is no god but Allah, and seek forgiveness for your fault, and for (the faults of) the believing men and believing women. And Allah knows your moving from place to place and your permanent abode.",
    "And the believers say, “Why has a (new) Sūrah not been revealed?” Then, once an operative Sūrah is sent down, and fighting (in Allah’s way) is mentioned in it, you notice those who have disease in their hearts, looking to you like one who is faint because of death. So, destruction is very close to them.",
    "The (reality of their) obedience and (truthfulness of their) speech is fully known (as being mere deception). So, had they been truthful to Allah when the matter had become serious, it would have been much better for them.",
    "So, (O hypocrites,) do you not apprehend that, in case you turn away (from Jihād ), you will spread disorder in the land and will sever your ties of kinship?",
    "Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed; so He has made them deaf, and made their eyes blind.",
    "Then, do they not give serious thought to the Qur’ān, or do they have locks on their hearts?",
    "Surely those who turn back after the guidance has appeared to them clearly, it is Satan who has tempted them and involved them in far-fetched fancies.",
    "That is because they say to those who hate that which Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some respects.” And Allah knows their secret talk.",
    "So, how (miserable) will they be when the angels will exact their souls, smiting their faces and their backs?",
    "That is because they followed that which has angered Allah, and they disliked His pleasure; therefore He has nullified their deeds.",
    "Do those having malady in their hearts think that Allah will never expose their grudges (against Islam)?",
    "Had We willed, We would have shown them to you (by identifying each one of them,) so as you would definitely recognize them by their features. However, you will recognize them by the tone of (their) speech. And Allah knows (all) your deeds.",
    "And We will certainly test you until We know those of you who carry out Jihād (struggle in Allah’s way) and observe patience, and until We check your episodes.",
    "Those who disbelieve and prevent (others) from Allah’s way, and oppose the Messenger, after the Guidance has appeared to them clearly, shall never bring harm to Allah in the least, and He will render their deeds vain.",
    "O you who believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and do not nullify your deeds.",
    "Those who disbelieved and prevented (others) from Allah’s way, then died as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them.",
    "So, do not lose heart, and do not appeal for peace; you will be the uppermost, and Allah is with you; and He will never deprive you of your deeds.",
    "The worldly life is but play and pastime. If you believe and be God-fearing, He will give you your rewards, and will not ask you your riches.",
    "If He were to ask you of it, and press you (to spend all your wealth), you would show miserliness, and He would expose your disgusts.",
    "Yes, you are such that you are called upon to spend in Allah’s way, but some of you withhold in miserliness- and he who withholds in miserliness withholds against himself- and Allah is the Need-Free, and you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you by some other people, then they will not be like you."
