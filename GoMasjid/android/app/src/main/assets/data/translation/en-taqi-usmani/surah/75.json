    "I swear by the Day of Resurrection,",
    "and I swear by the self-reproaching conscience, (that Resurrection is a reality.)",
    "Does man think that We will never reassemble his bones?",
    "Why (can We) not (do so), while We are able to reset (even) his fingertips perfectly?",
    "But man wishes to go on violating Allah’s injunctions (even in future) ahead of him.",
    "He asks, “When will be this Day of Resurrection?”",
    "So, when the eyes will be dazzled,",
    "and the moon will lose its light,",
    "and the sun and the moon will be joined together,",
    "on that day man will say, “Where to escape?”",
    "Never! There will be no refuge at all.",
    "On that day, towards your Lord will be the destination (of everyone.)",
    "Man will be informed of what he sent ahead and what he left behind.",
    "Rather, man will be a witness against himself,",
    "even though he may offer his excuses.",
    "(O Prophet,) do not move your tongue (during revelation) for (reciting) it (the Qur’ān) to receive it in hurry.",
    "It is surely undertaken by Us to store it (in your heart), and to let it be recited (by you after revelation is completed).",
    "Therefore, when it is recited by Us (through the angel), follow its recitation (by concentration of your heart).",
    "Then, it is undertaken by Us to explain it.",
    "Never, (your denial of Resurrection is never based on any sound reason!) Instead, you love that which is immediate,",
    "and neglect the Hereafter.",
    "Many faces, that day, will be glowing,",
    "looking towards their Lord,",
    "and many faces, that day, will be gloomy,",
    "realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them.",
    "Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles,",
    "and it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)”",
    "and he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,)",
    "and one shank is intertwined with the other shank,",
    "then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven.",
    "So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed,",
    "but rejected the truth and turned away (from it),",
    "then he went to his home, puffed up with pride.",
    "(It will be said to such a man,) Woe to you, then woe to you!",
    "Again, woe to you, then woe to you!",
    "Does man presume that he will be left unchecked?",
    "Was he not an ejaculated drop of semen?",
    "Then he became a clot of blood, then He created (him) and made (him) perfect,",
    "and made from him two kinds, male and female.",
    "Has He no power to give life to the dead?"
