    "Or do they intend a plot (against you O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)? But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) are themselves plotted against!",
    "Or have they an ilâh (a god) other than Allâh? Glorified be Allâh from all that they ascribe as partners (to Him)",
    "And if they were to see a piece of the heaven falling down, they would say: \"Clouds gathered in heaps!\"",

    "The Day when their plotting shall not avail them at all nor will they be helped (i.e. they will receive their torment in Hell).",
    "And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment (i.e. the torment in this world and in their graves) before this; but most of them know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarî).",
    "So wait patiently (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) for the Decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes; and glorify the Praises of your Lord when you get up from sleep.",
    "And in the nighttime also glorify His Praises - and at the setting of the stars."
